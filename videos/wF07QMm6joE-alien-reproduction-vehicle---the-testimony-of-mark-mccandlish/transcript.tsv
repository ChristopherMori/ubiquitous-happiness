0	7000	So that's the interesting thing. There's two nomenclatures that we need to define in what your whistleblowers told you goes into his report.
7000	11000	There's UAP and that's gray. We just don't know at this moment.
11000	27000	But Alien Reproduction Vehicle, I can tell you, is very, very clearly a reference to a vehicle that has been constructed from non-human technology that is being operated presumably by either private aerospace or the United States government.
27000	36000	A male staff member in Congressman Brown's office not only confirmed the exhibit, but the fact that there were three discs at that exhibit.
36000	45000	These discs were hovering off the floor without any visible means of support. They were referred to as Alien Reproduction Vehicles.
45000	49000	Also nicknamed the flux liner because they used high voltage electricity.
49000	59000	This general got up and he was describing these vehicles. He described them as Alien Reproduction Vehicles, ARB for short.
59000	69000	They also had a nickname for the aircraft. They called them flux liners. Now flux is an electrical term for a high electrical charge liner, a flux liner.
69000	79000	Brad said that in this exhibit at Norton Air Force Base that a three-star general said that these vehicles were capable of doing light speed or better.
79000	90000	In his groundbreaking article released in October of 2024, accomplished journalist Michael Schellenberger brought a new UAP whistleblower's testimony to the public zeitgeist.
90000	102000	This whistleblower uncovered the shadowy Immaculate Constellation, an unacknowledged special access program that consolidates observations of UAP by both tasked and untasked collection platforms.
102000	111000	The most groundbreaking aspect of this article to me was a single sentence mention of a term made famous by aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish.
111000	121000	The report concludes that the existence of Immaculate Constellation demonstrates the extent capability to detect, quarantine and transfer, UAP and ARV.
121000	130000	Alien Reproduction Vehicle collection incidents before they are observed and circulated within the military intelligence enterprise.
130000	139000	Many are familiar with the famous Alien Reproduction Vehicles, also known as flux liners described by McCandlish as relayed by Brad Sorensen,
139000	150000	who allegedly witnessed these three saucer-shaped craft reverse engineered from non-human intelligence technology at a classified air show near Norton Air Force Base in 1988.
150000	160000	But what is the full story behind ARV? What is the origin of this term? And what stories can we explore to try and support or discredit Schellenberger's whistleblower?
160000	167000	Why the conspiracies around Mark McCandlish and his 2014 documentary filmmaker James Allen's mysterious deaths?
167000	181000	What can we learn from a truly consequential, long-form interview primary witness Brad Sorensen gave in 1990, which I believe is the only time he ever spoke about the air show outside of conversations with McCandlish?
181000	187000	And why did Brad Sorensen tell me that I was next if I investigated this story further?
187000	198000	Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and thank you so very much for joining me as we investigate and take a deep dive into the subject of Alien Reproduction Vehicles as relayed by Mark McCandlish.
198000	211000	The concept of successfully reverse engineered UFO has perplexed me for many years and with the direct naming of ARV in the Immaculate Constellation article, I believe it is a perfect time to finally dive into this subject.
211000	219000	Let us analyze the testimony of the now infamous Mark McCandlish and explore all avenues of the Alien Reproduction Vehicle.
224000	234000	My name is Mark McCandlish and for the better part of the last 30 years I've been a conceptual artist, illustrator and designer, working predominantly for the aerospace and defense industries.
235000	260000	About 1988 I came into some information that indicated that the United States government was in possession of and operating a kind of anti-gravity technology through a system, an aircraft that was referred to as the flux liner or as the alien reproduction vehicle.
260000	270000	The late Mark McCandlish served as a highly decorated aerospace and aeronautical illustrator who devoted his talents to detailing sketches of advanced military and corporate projects.
270000	281000	Mark's client list was astounding including the US Air Force, Rockwell International, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, as well as respected publications such as Aviation Week and Popular Science.
282000	293000	Viewers of my channel may remember Mark for his appearance on Stephen Greer's 2001 National Press Club panel where he discussed the line art design of the alien reproduction vehicle aka flux liner.
293000	303000	But few understand the full story and depth to which McCandlish explored these anomalous vehicles, a depth which very well may have seen Mark meet his demise.
303000	318000	In the fall of 1988, McCandlish planned to attend an air show at Norton Air Force Base to network with military and government officials, as well as view new and innovative military aircraft with his good friend and fellow designer and inventor Brad Sorenson.
318000	329000	A short time before the show on November 12, 1988, Mark regrettably dropped out to finish some lucrative design work for popular science and left Brad to attend the air show with a client of his.
329000	343000	About a week after the show, Mark called his strangely absent friend, Brad, sounded off. On the phone, absent was his often animated personality. Brad told Mark he had seen something he probably shouldn't have.
359000	370000	I think I saw something I wasn't supposed to see. And I said, how's that possible? Everything that's at the air show is sent there and flown there with the intent to bring it on static display, especially for the public.
370000	381000	So how could you possibly see something that wasn't intended to be seen? He says, well, he says, I got him to see a display that was a little more exclusive.
381000	395000	Here is what Brad told Mark. Brad ultimately attended the air show with one of his clients described as a tall white man with glasses, an Italian sounding name, wealthy and a former secretary of defense or under secretary of defense.
395000	401000	Right around the time of the USAF Thunderbirds flyby at the air show, this individual issued Brad away from the main crowd.
402000	408000	Mark initially assumed Brad and the man arrived to a hangar with four connected huts in the middle for this exhibit.
408000	420000	But Brad would later disclose he, his client, amongst military personnel and dignitaries boarded a military version of the Boeing 727 and flew north of Norton to Palmdale Air Force Plant 42.
420000	436000	Both military and civilian that got on a military version of the Boeing 727 and they flew from Norton Air Force Base up to Air Force Plant 42, which is in Palmdale.
436000	445000	A lot of people just consider it the Palmdale Airport. It was actually a facility that was built from what I understand by Lockheed back in the 1960s.
445000	455000	And the hangar that is now serving as a Skunk Works hangar was the original construction site for the L-1011 Lockheed tri-star airliner.
455000	460000	Now remember Palmdale USAF Plant 42 as we will discuss this facility later.
460000	469000	Among the personnel sent on the 727 according to Brad were the late California Senator Alan Cranston and Congressman George E. Brown Jr.
469000	476000	who was at the time serving as the chairman of the Congressional Committee of Space Science and Advanced Technology.
476000	484000	Possibly our most key individual here is Brad's client, the tall Italian man who passed Brad's office as aid to board the flight to the special exhibit.
484000	494000	Brad seemingly never gave this man's name, or to protect Brad, McCandless never publicly confirmed this, but with high confidence Mark reasoned this individual was Frank Carlucci.
494000	498000	The 16th US Secretary of Defense succeeded by Dick Cheney.
498000	512000	Let's analyze Carlucci a little more. From 1992 to 2003 Carlucci served as chairman of the Carlisle Group, a private equity and asset management corporation with over $400 billion in assets.
512000	516000	I highly suspect is deeply involved with UAP programs.
516000	532000	Since its founding in 1987 under David Rubenstein, the Carlisle Group attracted myriad senior statesmen for advisors and board members including Carlucci, George H.W. Bush, Secretary of State James Baker and former UK Prime Minister John Major.
533000	547000	The Carlisle Group served as pioneer investors in defense and national security such as acquiring the electronics division of general dynamics, investing in Northrop Grumman and from 1999 to 2001 owned EG&G,
547000	555000	the same company deeply entwined in UFO lore from the testimony of Bob Lazar to serving as the parking lot hosting the Wilson Davis meeting.
555000	563000	I would also like to draw your attention to Ronald Moultrie, former Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security and the Biden Administration.
563000	573000	Along with his good friend Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, Moultrie served to spread disinformation by denying the existence of UAP at the 2022 UAP hearings.
573000	583000	Moultrie, sometimes referred to as a gatekeeper of UAP programs, has some very strange ties to the Carlisle Group, such as serving as a board member in iCapital,
583000	590000	a Carlisle-invested group and serving on the board of directors for the Better Angels funded by Carlisle's founder David Rubenstein.
590000	601000	Carlisle Group is not the topic of our video today, but the ties here to Carlucci alongside his probable involvement in a classified airshow demonstrating ARV is of extreme interest.
601000	611000	Walking into the Palmdale Hangar exhibit, Brad was told by his client, likely Carlucci, to keep his mouth shut and to not speak to anybody due to unexpected things at the show.
611000	621000	The exhibit featured numerous high-tech aircraft including the losing model from the B-2 stealth bomber competition and advanced hovercraft that employed hidden thrust mechanisms.
621000	626000	The show also had the infamous Lockheed Pulsar, aka the Aurora Craft.
626000	634000	The Aurora, sometimes referred to as Astra, has often historically been associated with a triangular-shaped, possibly reverse-engineered craft.
634000	640000	But in 1988, Brad relayed a much more grounded yet highly advanced design.
640000	648000	The Lockheed Aurora was described as a large flattened-out football, all black and covered in tiles not too dissimilar to the Space Shuttle.
648000	653000	Aurora featured a synthetic vision system utilizing infrared seeker heads.
653000	659000	There was, at the exhibit, however, a secondary model featuring a canopy cockpit and two vertical stabilizers.
659000	672000	Brad described this craft as employing two unusual propulsion systems, engines in the fuselage and external pulse detonation engines allowing the craft to fly 10,000 to 15,000 miles per hour.
672000	678000	Markwood later state Tom Keaton from Lockheed Martin Calabasas Division confirmed the existence of the Aurora to him.
678000	684000	Brad then described a massive black curtain separating the hangar into two distinct areas.
684000	688000	Brad made his way to the second half of the exhibit.
703000	708000	He's describing the different features.
708000	710000	How do you know that?
710000	714000	If you look at the outside of the vehicle, how do you know what the inner workings are?
714000	720000	They had taken some of the panels off the outside so you could see the inside of what the corpus looked like.
720000	724000	He said it was remarkably simple. There wasn't that much to it.
724000	726000	You were able to figure out how it worked from that.
726000	736000	He said, well, no, they had an easel next to it with a drawing, a cutaway drawing, that showed some of the internal components, how they were arranged and oriented to one another.
736000	750000	And then they had a little TV monitor with a tape player below it that was showing this continuous loop of this thing sitting or hovering over a dry lake bed out in the desert somewhere.
750000	759000	And as you would watch the tape, this thing would make, went from a hovering position, made these three little sort of hops going to the side.
759000	763000	And then as the camera followed it, it just went straight up and disappeared outside.
763000	767000	It was you down to nothing in just a matter of a second half or so.
767000	774000	When meeting Mark for lunch the following week, Brad would sketch and discuss what he observed at this special exhibit.
774000	783000	The exhibit was populated solely by top military brass and influential politicians and was guarded by men in berets with M16 rifles.
783000	794000	Displayed were three flying saucers hovering off the ground ranging in diameter from 20 to 24 feet to 120 to 130 feet, but identical in scale.
794000	805000	Brad described the craft to Mark as looking like they belonged in the 1950s, appearing like a jello mold on the bottom with sloping sides, a dome on top and a door that looked at home on a submarine.
805000	810000	A three star general began to describe the vehicles to the attendees.
810000	816000	The three saucers were called alien reproduction vehicles nicknamed flux liners.
816000	829000	Each of the three craft had panels removed for attendees to view the craft's interior and alongside the speaker's podium sat an easel showing craft blueprints as well as a video player showing film demonstrating the ARV's capabilities.
829000	840000	As Mark described, the film showed the ARV hovering over a dry lake bed before it would make three quick hops and jettison into the sky at astounding speeds.
840000	851000	One of the things that this general had said during the presentation, one of the things that really stood out at Brad's mind was that he said that these vehicles were capable of light speed or better.
851000	858000	Faster than light speeds is truly an astounding claim, so let's try and analyze the ARV in greater detail.
858000	869000	Fortunately, as a designer himself, Brad would describe the flux liners in extensive detail to Mark, allowing the talented artist to make up high quality blueprints and line art of the craft.
869000	874000	It is important to note the difference between the ARV and historical UAP testimony.
874000	883000	In numerous UAP and UAP crash sightings, Crafter often described as rivetless, seamless with no visible means of propulsion.
883000	890000	Often with a description of the vehicle looking 3D printed, this was night and day different to the ARV.
890000	896000	Sorenson described the ARV as extremely worn, appearing to have been operating for decades.
896000	906000	Chips were rampant in the lead paint coating of the craft, which seemed to serve to protect the crew from X-ray radiation, and the entire craft featured numerous smudges and fingerprints.
906000	909000	Each of the three ARVs featured a crew compartment.
909000	915000	The smallest design displayed four ejection seats attached to a vertical beam in the middle of the craft.
915000	924000	The pilot utilized a strange ball control scheme to operate the craft which allocated power to various parts of the craft's propulsion mechanism we will talk about shortly.
924000	928000	The ARV featured no windows for pilot visibility.
928000	934000	Instead, each saucer dome was outfitted with an array of bumps housing optical camera equipment.
934000	937000	This fitted the craft with a synthetic vision system.
937000	948000	This synthetic vision system uses the same kind of technology as the gun slaving system they have in the Apache helicopter, except in this case you have two cameras.
948000	955000	And it picks any pair of the cameras in that pattern of six that are around this circumference, including the one on the top.
955000	960000	Whichever pair most closely matches the orientation of the pilot's head.
960000	964000	So if he wants to look behind him, he can pick a view in that direction.
964000	972000	The cameras slew in pairs and he has a little screen in front of his helmet and it gives him an alternating view.
972000	976000	He has a little set of glasses that he wears.
976000	984000	In fact, you can actually buy a 3D viewing system for your video camera now that does the same thing.
984000	991000	What it does is it uses a beam splitter which sends part of light one way and part of it at a right angle and offsets it by about six inches.
991000	1003000	And then it has an electronic shutter in there that uses these like a liquid crystal type material that darkens and becomes transparent at intervals of about 60th of a second or 30th of a second.
1003000	1008000	And so the cameras as they're looking around are giving him a right left right left view.
1008000	1013000	And the goggles, the things that he's wearing, he has two little projection screens inside his helmet.
1013000	1017000	And they both project, well two cameras, but one projection screen.
1017000	1025000	And the glasses have that special blocking device that allows one eye to see and then the other eye to see.
1025000	1032000	And at the same time, the cameras are projecting right view, left view, right view, left view, but they're doing it in like 30 frames a second.
1032000	1037000	And so when he looks around, he has a perfect 3D view of the outside but no windows.
1037000	1041000	The crew compartment or dome was completely separate from the propulsion system.
1041000	1048000	And the propulsion system made no noise, featured no moving parts and output no gases or exhaust.
1048000	1058000	Interestingly, Brad would state many of the craft's components including the crew jump seats and cameras seem similar to off shelf components and not highly specialized for the ARV.
1058000	1067000	Radial oxygen tanks, presumably for crew atmosphere, sat atop an enormous capacitor array estimated by Mark to be roughly 14 inches thick.
1067000	1074000	Curiously, a radial arm sat above the capacitor plates featuring the ability to extend outside the body of the craft.
1074000	1078000	Mark theorized the purpose of this arm was for sample collection.
1078000	1087000	Mark questioned Brad if due to the capacitor array, he thought this meant the craft function via the by-field brown effect which converts electrostatic energy into propulsion.
1087000	1096000	To learn more about electro-gravitics and I feel like I've said this in the last five videos, I highly recommend watching Jesse Michael's video on T. Townsend-Brownt and please note,
1096000	1106000	I recently theorized Edwards Air Force Base, which is very close to USAF Plant 42 and Norton, engages in the reverse engineering ARV testing program.
1106000	1112000	Historically, Edwards placed very heavy importance in alternative propulsion methods such as the by-field brown effect.
1112000	1119000	I highly recommend watching this video as over the course of this ARV exploration, we will further discuss ties to Edwards.
1119000	1130000	Brad stated perhaps the by-field brown effect had some sort of application here, but the ARV were in fact utilizing energy drawn from quantum fluctuations, a.k.a. zero point energy.
1130000	1139000	This again calls back to the witness Ed I covered in my video on reverse engineering at Edwards Air Force Base, who commented on the existence of zero point systems.
1139000	1150000	There is a scientist in Utah by the name of Maury B. King. He's written a book called Tapping the Zero Point Energy and what he maintains is that this energy is embedded in space time all around us.
1150000	1163000	It's in everything we see. I think it was, I don't know, it was a James Clerk Maxwell speculated that there's enough of this flux, this electrical charge in the nothingness of space
1163000	1175000	that if you could capture all the energy that was embedded in just a cubic yard of space, that you'd have enough energy to boil the oceans of the entire world.
1175000	1178000	That's how much energy is sitting there waiting to be tapped.
1179000	1191000	Before we continue with Mark's investigation, let's take a moment to recognize Mark as Berlin's secondhand information up to now on ARV.
1191000	1196000	Why should we take him at his word and do we have comment from Mr. Sorensen?
1196000	1203000	Due to not having journalistic discretion, Mark historically regretted introducing Brad's full name into the story.
1203000	1210000	And I had a colleague, a friend who I'll just call Brad for the sake of this discussion.
1210000	1224000	Some people know what his last name is and I've tried to discontinue using his name principally because disclosing of his name has brought a lot of unwanted attention to him and his career.
1224000	1238000	I don't know specifically what if any or how much harm has come to him in terms of his career because of my disclosures.
1238000	1253000	I have to say that not being a journalist, not having a background in journalism, I didn't really know when I was being prodded by people in the disclosure project to name names and things like that, which I did.
1254000	1264000	That, you know, this could be potentially and very harmful to the individuals who had been the original source of material.
1264000	1276000	In the case of Brad, and another individual who had had occasion to see one of these things up close when he was actually in the service in 1973 at Edwards Air Force Base.
1276000	1290000	There were a lot of details that were not only seen by these individuals, but were also explained to them, you know, basically to understand what they were looking at.
1290000	1295000	Brad has been strangely radio silent on Mark in the story of ARV.
1295000	1298000	Well, of course, I got in contact with Brad.
1298000	1302000	Interactions with him from the get go were extremely hostile.
1302000	1310000	I was told, quote, Mark McCandless was a stupid, dramatic, selfish fool who died because he could not keep his mouth shut.
1310000	1312000	Learn from this, end quote.
1312000	1321000	This statement is in relation to Mark's strange and controversial 2021 passing, allegedly resulting from a self-inflicted gunshot wound we will revisit later.
1321000	1325000	But Brad's words directly imply Mark's words got him killed.
1325000	1337000	Further interactions with Brad would lead to him saying I cannot cover this topic without facing mortal peril and to say goodbye to everyone I love if I continue to investigate Mark in the subject of ARV.
1337000	1340000	I was even told I would never see it coming.
1340000	1347000	My most interesting interaction with Brad stemmed from asking why Mark was allowed to talk openly about this topic for 20 years.
1347000	1351000	I was told Brad protected Mark until he could not.
1351000	1353000	We will discuss this further later.
1353000	1358000	Hostile and silent, Brad has historically refused to comment on this case.
1358000	1365000	But for this investigation, I have uncovered some documents I have never before seen discussed in the public domain.
1365000	1378000	In December of 1990, two years after Mark and Brad met to discuss the flux liner, Mark relayed the contents of the restricted air show to William B. Scott, senior engineering editor of Aviation Week and Space Technology.
1378000	1388000	Bill would feature some of Mark's sketches on the pulse detonation Aurora craft on the respected magazine and reach out to Brad for comment on the experimental aircraft and more strange craft.
1388000	1394000	As some of the craft Mark described, matched eyewitness accounts relayed to the prestigious magazine over the years.
1394000	1404000	Around this time, Brad went silent, even secluding himself to Mark, but not before Bill Scott was able to interview Brad on December 3, 1990.
1404000	1408000	Let's dive into this interview I have never once before seen discussed.
1408000	1414000	Brad stated he was not officially invited to the hangar in which the strange aircraft exhibit was stored.
1414000	1420000	He was, as Mark stated, passed off as an aide for a gentleman who served within the Carter administration.
1420000	1426000	Seen as Frank Carducci was deputy director of the CIA for Carter, he may still serve as a logical choice here.
1426000	1428000	But why did Brad take this interview?
1428000	1437000	Well, as he stated, quote, because I love America and the whole nine yards, but I'm also a Democrat and I don't think we need this type of spending on military equipment.
1437000	1438000	It's just nuts.
1438000	1440000	And that's what the whole meeting was for.
1440000	1444000	Appropriations of billions of dollars to develop new craft, end quote.
1444000	1446000	Very interesting statement.
1446000	1454000	The 30 or so individuals present here were to be shown prototype and craft functionality to attract investors to these black budget projects.
1454000	1462000	Brad described blue fatigued and suit clad men conducting the briefings at the special air show with exotic yet prosaic craft on display.
1462000	1471000	Quote, Diff in each area, like a specialist in each area, some wearing suits, some wearing military, like Air Force, Colonel, Major, something like that.
1471000	1474000	I did not see any stars in there, like generals of any sort.
1474000	1476000	If there had, I would have noticed that end quote.
1477000	1484000	Bill and Brad discussed some of the veto, vertical takeoff and landing craft at the show and the utilization of depleted uranium shells.
1484000	1490000	Brad even noticed the V-22 Osprey was present, whose first official flight was conducted in 1989.
1490000	1495000	The witness also confirmed the presence of California State Senator Alan Cranston.
1495000	1500000	The rest of the crowd all appeared to be senior individuals, 45 to 60 years old.
1500000	1505000	No support staff or aides surrounded what Brad referred to as the people.
1505000	1510000	This section of the exhibit was likened to the hangar deck of an aircraft carrier with tightly packed craft.
1510000	1514000	Most of the craft appeared to Brad as one-off prototypes.
1514000	1519000	One of the enclosures featured the losing B-2 bomber prototypes just as Mark would later state.
1519000	1528000	Brad also confirmed the unmanned, elongated, football-shaped Aurora craft that looked extremely similar to Mark's sketches but with a more tapered back.
1528000	1533000	The craft was enormous, almost 100 to 110 feet in length.
1533000	1536000	The dual propulsion system of the Aurora was also confirmed.
1536000	1540000	Internal fuselage engines were utilized to get up into the air.
1540000	1549000	Then pulse detonation engines were used to accelerate the craft to truly incredible speeds, 6 to 8 Mach, which is why the craft was unmanned.
1549000	1554000	The present officials were extremely proud of the Aurora craft, stating quote,
1554000	1560000	within an hour and 20 minutes they could take out every city over a million in the Soviet Union, end quote.
1560000	1564000	Bill Scott asked if the Aurora was the most exotic thing on display.
1564000	1568000	Brad responded with a resounding three nos.
1568000	1576000	Brad would then state Mark's ARV drawing was so GD accurate, there was little he could further specify about the craft.
1576000	1584000	When Brad first witnessed the alien reproduction vehicles, he was reminded of a nursery rhyme, labeling the craft Daddy, Mommy, and Baby Bear,
1585000	1590000	as the craft seemed identically crafted to the same proportions but in different sizes.
1590000	1597000	The smallest was roughly 20 feet in diameter, medium 60 feet and the largest 120 feet in diameter.
1597000	1602000	Brad stated he thought the craft were very poorly built compared to the other craft on display, quote,
1602000	1609000	they had been built by scientists who didn't know a hell of a lot about laying up composite materials or whatever, end quote.
1609000	1614000	The crew compartment sphere appeared to have messy filaments for the sole purpose of holding in pressure.
1614000	1618000	The entire craft was coated with a thick, heavy lead paint.
1618000	1622000	Brad confirmed the ARVs were hovering, not connected to the floor.
1622000	1626000	Brad was told the three craft didn't need a fuel source.
1626000	1633000	They had found a new fuel source that was everywhere in the universe on the order of 500 times the speed of light,
1633000	1637000	allowing the craft to travel five to eight times the speed of light.
1637000	1642000	To dive into the gravity manipulation propulsion system, which Mark would later on discuss further,
1642000	1648000	the craft was able to output 10 to the 26 power joules per cubic meter of space.
1648000	1652000	Utilizing the synthetic vision system and pilot control ball,
1652000	1658000	the vehicle was able to allocate power from the capacitor plates to travel to very different destinations,
1658000	1662000	all with the ability to withstand 85 Gs of acceleration.
1662000	1666000	The local area around the craft was not subject to inertial forces.
1666000	1668000	Mark will expand on this later on.
1668000	1672000	Curiously to Brad, the craft didn't feature food or long-term provisions,
1672000	1675000	nor were any compasses or navigational charts present.
1675000	1683000	Drawings, diagrams, and videotapes showed the craft flying in jerky, serrated, up-and-down patterns before jettisoning out of sight.
1683000	1687000	The craft did not appear to involve normal aerodynamic principles.
1687000	1691000	The exhibit attendees were told there were only three craft in existence.
1691000	1692000	Quote,
1692000	1694000	You can take this how you want to.
1694000	1696000	We took all of it with a grain of salt.
1696000	1702000	But the guy said that with this group of craft that, uh, they had been everywhere in the solar system,
1702000	1704000	and there's no life, end quote.
1704000	1708000	I must make a correction here, as initially Brad said no life in the universe,
1708000	1710000	but he corrected this to mean solar system.
1710000	1715000	The men running the ARV exhibit claimed they copied the concepts of the vehicle.
1715000	1719000	Bill asked if the non-uniformed man answering audience questions
1719000	1722000	discussed what the vehicles had been produced from.
1722000	1723000	Quote,
1723000	1724000	Well, they tried to avoid it.
1724000	1727000	They said something about 1947.
1727000	1729000	They had some sort of a contact,
1729000	1733000	telling them that we had no right to use nuclear weapons, okay?
1733000	1735000	That it was more disturbed than we knew.
1735000	1737000	Cease and assist, end quote.
1737000	1743000	Brad would then give, in my opinion, the most interesting statement of this entire interview.
1743000	1746000	And all they really needed to do was give us the truth,
1746000	1748000	and we would either take it or leave it.
1748000	1752000	They just said that they had come across some hardware, tried to make contact with these.
1752000	1755000	The others didn't want to make contact.
1755000	1758000	They just wanted to deliver the news and leave, okay?
1758000	1761000	But back in 1947, we had just won the war.
1761000	1766000	We felt pretty damned cavalier, and we attacked, basically, okay?
1766000	1771000	Rather than fighting back, they just tried to destroy all of their stuff and get away.
1771000	1774000	And they didn't get all of it destroyed.
1774000	1775000	That's what they said.
1775000	1779000	Also said they couldn't really make those things that they found work.
1779000	1781000	That they had to build their own.
1781000	1784000	That this was built for our consumption, not theirs.
1784000	1788000	Theirs was the wrong scale and the wrong, you know, whatever.
1788000	1789000	Bill says,
1789000	1791000	So we just looked at theirs and built our own.
1791000	1792000	Brad responds,
1792000	1793000	Uh-huh.
1793000	1794000	Based on what was seen.
1794000	1797000	So it was not like a great R&D breakthrough.
1797000	1802000	It was just copying something that they had seen to the best of their abilities.
1802000	1809000	I need to take a moment to stress just how important this interview with Brad Sorensen and Bill Scott is.
1809000	1813000	Quite often, you will see individuals criticize Mark McCandless's story
1813000	1816000	because they claim he is relaying second-hand information.
1816000	1821000	As we saw in this interview, which I have never seen once discussed before,
1821000	1824000	Brad confirms not only the air show,
1824000	1826000	not only the Aurora,
1826000	1830000	not only the B2 losing competitor and the stealth bomber prototypes,
1830000	1836000	but also the ARV craft as saucers with faster than light speed capabilities.
1836000	1840000	This is massive to see this in Brad's own words.
1840000	1844000	Why did Bill Scott and Aviation Week in Space Technology never publish this segment?
1844000	1847000	Well, it makes sense as we saw in the document where
1847000	1851000	Bill states that he had trouble believing some of the things Brad said
1851000	1855000	because it had to do with flying saucers that were capable of light speed
1855000	1861000	that were copied from other beans in technology dating back to 1947.
1861000	1865000	Just wanted to take a minute to say that if you want to read the entire interview,
1865000	1868000	I highly suggest it because I just did a summary here.
1868000	1871000	The entire thing is quite mind-boggling.
1871000	1873000	Back to the investigation.
1873000	1878000	Was the ARV technology copied from the 1947 Roswell craft?
1878000	1881000	The crudeness of the craft makes logical sense when in context
1881000	1885000	scientists and engineers couldn't make the found anomalous craft work.
1885000	1890000	The men spearheading the ARV program wished to build a fleet of these craft,
1890000	1892000	but sought appropriate funding for it,
1892000	1896000	hoping the Bush administration would be as enthusiastic as the Reagan administration
1896000	1899000	about building up these reproduction vehicles.
1899000	1902000	Never was it revealed who these vehicles belonged to
1902000	1904000	or who these men reported to.
1904000	1908000	Wow guys, so 11 years before Mark appeared on the disclosure project
1908000	1910000	making the term ARV famous,
1910000	1914000	Brad had actually confirmed the story all the way back in 1990.
1914000	1918000	Included in these interview notes is a sketch of the exhibit
1918000	1921000	which I believe was drawn by Sorensen's hand.
1921000	1926000	Let's circle back to Mark and dive into his investigation around the ARV.
1930000	1935000	After listening intently to Sorensen and analyzing the rough sketches of the ARVs,
1935000	1937000	Brad drew on some legal paper.
1937000	1940000	Mark got to work utilizing his legendary drawing skills
1940000	1944000	to translate the ARV to traditional blueprint designs.
1944000	1949000	Mark's work ultimately led to the now famous ARV flux liner cutaway drawing.
1949000	1953000	One of the original blueprints of the alien reproduction vehicle
1953000	1956000	which I produced in March of 1989,
1956000	1965000	was put together by accumulating a lot of verbal testimony from Brad and later
1965000	1969000	from a number of other sources including Kent Snowlin and some other people
1969000	1973000	that I talked to who had some contact or information about the vehicle.
1973000	1977000	In this clip we heard Mark mention alongside Sorensen
1977000	1981000	his design was based on the testimony of others who had seen the craft.
1981000	1986000	In 2001, McCandlish would feature in Stephen Greer's National Press Club conference
1986000	1990000	with his explosive testimony as well as a Stephen Greer interview
1990000	1996000	titled Blueprint for a UFO where he would expand on additional sightings of ARV.
1996000	2001000	Later, I spoke to a gentleman by the name of Kent Snowlin
2001000	2005000	that I met at an air show at Edwards Air Force Base in 1992,
2005000	2008000	the first unveiling publicly of the B-2 bomber.
2008000	2012000	He indicated to me that in 1973 when he was a crew chief
2012000	2017000	working on experimental aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base
2017000	2025000	that he had unintentionally wandered into an area where there was a classified aircraft, namely the ARV.
2025000	2031000	He described it in detail and he added other details to the account
2031000	2037000	concerning the configuration and the operations vehicle that Brad Sorensen was not aware of
2037000	2042000	According to Selin, while working for the Air Intelligence Agency at Edwards North Base
2042000	2050000	he witnessed the Fluxliner ARV in 1973 when cutting across the base to retrieve a ground power unit.
2050000	2056000	Sightings of ARV at Edwards are possibly corroborated within the long-lost files of Leonard Stringfield.
2056000	2061000	In crash retrievals of the third kind, fantastic CAD designer Michael Schrat
2061000	2065000	gained access to the files of the late Stringfield in Mufon, Ohio.
2065000	2071000	Here, Schrat would publish cases that had not made their way into the crash retrieval status reports 1-7.
2071000	2078000	Leonard received information from a Class A witness who claimed to have witnessed a captured UFO at Edwards.
2078000	2083000	This pilot was given permission to cut across the base in a USAF security vehicle
2083000	2086000	when he stopped at a group of hangars to ask for directions.
2086000	2093000	Within the open hangars, the witness observed a large disc-shaped craft with a clear transparent dome on the top.
2093000	2099000	The witness was immediately told to vacate the area. The incident allegedly took place in the 1960s.
2099000	2105000	Similar instances exist in the files of Stringfield such as the testimony of one Mr. Hines
2105000	2109000	who relayed second-hand info from a source at Bell Labs.
2109000	2116000	In the early 1950s, this source saw a UFO retrieval or test craft being brought into a California airbase.
2116000	2119000	The source additionally saw a cutaway of the craft.
2119000	2127000	The fantastic 2014 documentary we've been pulling clips from titled Zero Point, The Story of Mark McCandless and the Fluxliner
2127000	2134000	explores an additional witness who claimed to have knowledge of the ARV, one Lieutenant Colonel John Williams.
2134000	2140000	Williams' 2000 testimony also features briefly in Stephen Greer's fantastic disclosure briefing document.
2141000	2149000	Williams served as an electrical engineer in charge of construction projects for military air command at Norton from 1981 to 1982.
2149000	2155000	The Lieutenant Colonel stated he knew of a facility within Norton Air Force Base that was so secretive
2155000	2158000	not even the base's wing commander was allowed access.
2158000	2164000	Rumors circulated the base facility housed a UFO. Very little more than rumors here in Williams' story,
2164000	2168000	however, even the implication of a craft near Norton is worthy to analyze.
2168000	2173000	Mark's pursuit of tracking down other witnesses of ARV was relentless.
2173000	2180000	In 2001, on the Disclosure Project conference panel, Mark would display two original photographs obtained from
2180000	2190000	USAF Captain Harvey Williams, who photographed a disc in 1967 while flying a C-47 at 12,000 feet over Provo, Utah.
2190000	2197000	Mark would state the images accurately depict the ARV craft up to the synthetic vision systems on the crew component of the craft.
2198000	2205000	Mark utilized these photographs to highlight how the synthetic vision system may have changed from 1967 to 1988.
2205000	2216000	As mentioned before, many components of the 1988 ARV as relayed by Brad utilized off-shelf components, including the synthetic vision systems and surrounding acrylic bubble.
2216000	2224000	Mark reasoned due to cameras being much larger in 1967, the vision system bubbles would need to be much larger as well to accommodate these devices.
2224000	2228000	Interesting to analyze this possible ARV evolution.
2228000	2247000	Later on, I obtained photographs that were taken in 1967 by military pilot Harvey Williams flying a C-47 for the Air Force at 12,000 feet approximately 25 miles southwest of Provo, Utah.
2247000	2256000	This particular vehicle matches the so-called ARV in all proportions and respects in terms of the detail of the shape of the craft.
2256000	2263000	I would like to quickly highlight Provo, Utah is under 100 miles from Dugway Proving Grounds, a location I have covered previously.
2263000	2276000	Witness MS claimed to have observed a hovering craft at the Dugway Aviary Building and also knew of a DUM, a deep underground military base engaging in UAP programs under Dugway's main facility.
2276000	2286000	From 1988 to his passing in 2021, Mark's insatiable curiosity would lead him to devoting much of his life to discovering how the ARV functioned.
2286000	2299000	He would draw parallels to possible Nazi flying saucer technology and the Glock, patents filed by associates of T. Townsend Brown, and even technology possibly discovered by the great Nikola Tesla.
2299000	2304000	Mark's research led him to hypothesize an elegantly simple yet crude design.
2304000	2312000	The ARV system, for all of its claims of flashy out-of-this-world propulsion capabilities, was indeed remarkably simple.
2312000	2326000	It could be described as a large-scale, souped-up Tesla coil designed to negate gravity and inertia, with off-the-shelf navigation and life support systems bolted on almost as an afterthought.
2326000	2335000	You could think of it as the Model T of anti-gravity vehicles, an industrial dune buggy, or crude hot rod that can get you to Mars in a few minutes.
2335000	2339000	In this version at least, first-class seating was still a way off.
2339000	2345000	The most complicated aspect of the ARV to Mark seemed to be the pilot's control system.
2345000	2357000	The sphere itself appears to be a kind of a domed arrangement where you have a number of fiber optic leaves that come into the sphere.
2357000	2369000	And for each one of the 48 capacitor arrays, there's a series of sensors that are then used to sort of relay information to the individual plates.
2369000	2385000	And so then, on the bottom of this, you have a bowl that moves around and can be used to convey the commands of the pilot in terms of what he wants to do in terms of shaping the field around the vehicle.
2385000	2395000	And right in the center of that bowl is a kind of laser diode that sends a laser beam up into the underside, the inside of the sphere.
2395000	2406000	And so as the bowl moves, that laser is sort of scanning around on the inside of the different sensors that are responsible for each of the capacitor sections.
2406000	2413000	Then there's a series of relays that will open up and close and let a certain amount of energy in or prevent it from going in.
2413000	2418000	And when it's dead center, it means that all of them get the exact same amount of information. You just go straight up.
2418000	2428000	If you want to bank to the right, then you bank this to the right. It sends the laser signal over to the opposite side of the dome.
2428000	2433000	And it says that the opposite side of the craft is going to get more energy, so it banks in that direction.
2433000	2447000	It's kind of like in a helicopter, in the swash plate of a helicopter, when you want to bank to the left, you create more deflection in the main rotor on the right side so that it begins to bank to the left.
2447000	2449000	It's kind of the same principle.
2449000	2459000	Mark theorized the craft operated in space-time similar to an Alcubierre drive, a system that compresses space-time ahead of a craft and stretches space-time behind a craft.
2459000	2467000	The area between these two vectors creates a localized space-time, reducing inertial effects and mitigating G-forces for the craft.
2467000	2478000	The Alcubierre drive allows for a faster-than-light travel system, however. The validity of this drive has been debated endlessly, and I simply do not have the physics capabilities to contribute to this argument.
2478000	2487000	This mitigation of G-forces and inertial dampening seems to be present in numerous historical UAP sightings where instantaneous acceleration is observed.
2487000	2500000	Perhaps a localized space-time pocket is indeed possible with NHI and ARV craft, and I'd like to leave you with some words by former Northrop Grumman deputy CTO and colonel of Army Futures Command, Carl Nell.
2500000	2507000	The second point is faster-than-light travel. Everybody says faster-than-light travel is not possible. This is false.
2508000	2523000	Miguel Alcubierre, a postgraduate student at the University of Mexico in 1994, solved Einstein's equations for an effective faster-than-light mechanism. NASA has investigated this. Everyone accepts his solution as valid.
2523000	2531000	These performance characteristics draw my attention to estimating flight characteristics of anomalous, unidentified aerial vehicles by Professor Kevin Knuth.
2531000	2539000	In this paper, PhD Professor Knuth estimated the G-forces experienced by the Tic Tac craft in Commander David Fraver's 2004 sighting.
2539000	2548000	G-forces experienced by this craft when it dropped from a high altitude to sea level were estimated to reach in excess of 5,500 Gs, for reference.
2548000	2555000	Our best ballistic missiles can experience but a fraction of these G-forces before ripping themselves to shreds.
2555000	2563000	Mark's research would ultimately lead to a 2015 lecture at the secret space program titled The Feasibility of Interstellar Travel.
2563000	2572000	The summary of this discussion states, quote, how back-engineered off-world technology created powerful leverage for corporations to take over control of world government,
2572000	2577000	establish an internationally manned secret space program, and break away civilization, end quote.
2577000	2587000	Even though first-hand witness Brad Sorensen stated the enigmatic men showing off the ARV claim the craft had explored our solar system, this is a very charged statement by Mark.
2587000	2594000	Oftentimes, the phrase secret space program is associated with unexplained claims and outright bizarre stories.
2594000	2600000	So let's instead analyze the claims of Gary McKinnon and Edgar Fausch in relation to a secret space program.
2600000	2616000	I have spoken about USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fausch myriad times, most recently analyzing his claims of encountering full anti-gravity propulsion systems for a secret space fleet while working for the proposed Defense Advanced Research Center in 1979.
2616000	2626000	Fausch claimed triangular-shaped craft titled TR-3B leveraged reverse-engineer technology to provide logistics and transportation to a secret space fleet.
2626000	2636000	Construction of these craft are allegedly a joint effort by Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Teledyne, and the project is managed by the NRO, CIA, and NSA.
2636000	2643000	Fausch's testimony is extremely impactful for me due to stating pilots of the TR-3B craft are few and far between.
2643000	2648000	These elite pilots are plucked from the Edwards 412th Test Group Test Pilot School.
2648000	2664000	I recently did a whole investigation into this subject and with high confidence in this project's validity, I explored a joint research project between Edwards Air Force Base and Nellis Air Force Base focused on testing reverse-engineered craft and technology of non-human origin.
2664000	2681000	This project I explored employs contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, SKIMS funds off the F-35 fighter program, operates over restricted airspace such as the Nevada Test and Training Range, and employs the Edwards 412th Test Pilot School and Electronics Warfare Group.
2681000	2689000	Have no fears that TR-3B will get a full exploration of its own, but context around Mark's discussion on a secret space program is extremely valuable here.
2689000	2698000	Additionally, remember if you will, US Army Green Beret RA, who witnessed the off-world technologies division at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana.
2698000	2709000	RA stated in an interview to me while performing operations on Nellis and nearby DOE-owned land, he was witnessed to triangular-shaped craft operating off electro-gravitic propulsion.
2709000	2716000	In 2002, British hacker Gary McKinnon was arrested for hacking into US Army and NASA computer systems.
2716000	2726000	McKinnon claimed amongst mundane files was an image housed in the NASA Johnson Space Center featuring a cigar-shaped object stationed in near-Earth orbit.
2726000	2735000	McKinnon also claimed to have found a document on a NASA server titled Non-Terrestrial Officers containing names and ranks of USAF personnel.
2735000	2739000	Amongst these documents were tabs for material transfer between ships.
2739000	2745000	This already draws parallels to Foush's TR-3B logistics and personnel carrier ships.
2745000	2753000	So maybe this idea of a black-budget hidden space program isn't so fantastical. Let's see what Mark has to say in this discussion.
2753000	2763000	I want to talk to you about a few of the different vehicles that I believe are being used in the secret space program or have been used in the secret space program.
2763000	2771000	Craft listed here are of course the Fluxliner Alien Reproduction Vehicle as well as the first-generation Aurora constructed by Lockheed
2771000	2779000	and a triangular-shaped craft out of Lockheed Skunkworks that allegedly served as the target for a 1989 Germany crash retrieval operation.
2779000	2787000	The candlest detailed how his first suspicions of highly classified black-budget aircraft programs arose when he met two Lockheed Skunkworks personnel
2787000	2793000	who commissioned Mark to illustrate a pitch to DoD for a new jet with extreme speed capabilities.
2793000	2799000	Mark compared components of scramjet technology to create what he thought was an extremely eye-catching design.
2799000	2809000	Meeting with these Skunkworks personnel, they grew furious with Mark, accidentally letting it slip aircraft components would tear apart during Mach 17 speeds or 13,000 miles per hour.
2809000	2816000	And remember, this was before Lockheed became Lockheed Martin, so this incident occurred even before the Sorenson ARV incident.
2816000	2826000	For reference, the world's fastest jet, the unmanned NASA X-43, reaches a top speed of Mach 9.6 or 7,366 miles per hour.
2826000	2835000	And the world's fastest man jet, the SR-71 Blackbird, reached solely Mach 3.3 or 2,193 miles per hour.
2835000	2841000	Mark moved on to discuss in great detail Sorenson's ARV experience in 1988.
2841000	2844000	Not a ton of new information here we haven't already covered.
2844000	2853000	Mark did touch on the interesting point that Brad and most likely Frank Carlucci flew a short flight to Palmdale Air Force Plant 42 to view this special exhibit.
2853000	2871000	As they were going into the hangar, the gentleman turns to my friend and says, he just realized that there are some aircraft on exhibit here that you're not cleared for security-wise.
2871000	2879000	You are not cleared to see these aircraft, so just enjoy the show, walk around, listen, take a look, but don't say anything to anybody.
2879000	2890000	So he goes in, I don't know how well you can see this because it came out kind of light, but there were two sections to this particular hangar on the inside.
2890000	2897000	I would like to add Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale is less than 30 miles southwest of Edwards Air Force Base.
2897000	2905000	The site features a sizable Northrop Grumman facility as well as Lockheed Martin hangars and the home of the infamous Lockheed Martin Skunk Works Division.
2905000	2914000	The claim these ARVs were shown at Plant 42 very near Edwards matches very closely with my previous thesis of a joint reverse engineering program out of Edwards.
2914000	2933000	Now, Witness Ed stated he worked on joint programs with Lockheed Martin and Boeing, yet historically Northrop has been additionally implicated in the construction of the TR-3B Black MantaCraft and an anti-gravity disc known as the Great Pumpkin developed at Northrop Grumman Advanced Concepts and Technologies Division, Palmdale, California.
2933000	2946000	Hang tight guys because our next project will cover US aerospace craft allegedly built with NHI technology, especially because there are numerous claims of joint developed reverse engineered craft from Lockheed Skunk Works and Northrop Grumman.
2946000	2962000	All of these deviations from Mark's story are to say I find the continued parallels between the alien reproduction vehicle and the 412th reverse engineering group at Edwards and Nellis quite tangible as well as the addition of Northrop Grumman to the core contractors engaging in ARV.
2962000	2979000	Mark leveraged his understanding of physics to discuss how the ARV craft possibly generated three different electromagnetic fields. One created by the primary windings of the Tesla coil, one created by the windings in the center, and finally one created by a low temperature plasma fired through the center.
2979000	2986000	And guys, I say this all the time, physics really isn't my strong suit so please watch the lecture for a better understanding.
2986000	3003000	So in the process, what I really think that I've sort of stumbled across is a way in which this system here has three different electromagnetic fields. It has the one created by the primary windings of the Tesla coil.
3003000	3025000	It has the windings in the center that also creates their electromagnetic field. But then when that plasma ring, or I should say it's actually a sort of a low temperature plasma like phenomenon or a virtual plasma, it fires down through the center and it also creates its own set of electromagnetic field lines.
3025000	3038000	And so what happens is you have an effect, it's very similar to, you've heard of the electromagnetic pulse that occurs when a nuclear bomb goes off. Well they actually have a weapons called the explosively pumped electromagnetic pulse weapon.
3038000	3053000	And it does the same thing and what it does is it just combines overlapping electromagnetic field lines and then using explosives, it pinches all, oops, sorry, it pinches all those magnetic field lines and it creates a powerful pulse.
3053000	3064000	And so what I'm suggesting to you is that process is actually forms a kind of a doorway for tapping into this zero point energy. Now why is that significant? Why does that mean anything?
3065000	3077000	Well part of the reason is that this device, when it taps into zero point energy, they've shown that zero point energy is actually responsible for the effect of gravity, for inertia and for mass.
3077000	3090000	And so if you're pulling some of that energy out of the environment, it may be, even though there's an infinite amount, I mean some of the latest figures are 10 to the 109th power joules per cubic centimeter.
3090000	3103000	That's one of the latest figures I've seen. That's a monstrous amount of energy. That's enough energy that if you took all of the energy that's in this amount of space time and were able to tap it, it would be able to boil off the oceans of the entire planet.
3103000	3115000	So you can see how this technology makes a hydrogen bomb look like a firecracker. That's probably one of the reasons why there's such a tremendous effort to suppress it because in the wrong hands obviously it could be weaponized, it'd be very dangerous.
3116000	3127000	Now for example, Einstein said you can never travel faster than speed of light because as you accelerate through space time, your interaction with the zero point energy that's embedded in space time raises your mass.
3127000	3132000	And so it makes it harder and harder for you to go faster and faster so you can never really reach the speed of light.
3132000	3139000	In fact he said if you could, that as you approach the speed of light, that your mass would become near infinite.
3139000	3147000	So imagine then that you're actually using the free energy of zero point energy. You're tapping that as your propulsive force. You're using it in the environment.
3147000	3156000	So there's a couple things that might happen when you do this. One is that it reduces the mass of your vehicle because you're using this stuff that would otherwise create to its increase.
3156000	3160000	And you're using that to do work. You're using it as a propulsive force.
3160000	3174000	So under that theory, under that theory you could actually be able to accelerate up to and beyond the speed of light because the very energy that would be ordinarily slowing you down by raising your mass is actually what you're using to push you along.
3174000	3184000	I do find it very interesting since 1975 Los Alamos National Labs was conducting extensive research into these explosive magnetic flux compression generators.
3184000	3197000	Mark would then highlight a Polaroid image taken north of Cedarville, California in the spring of 1984, which he purported may be one of the only photographs in existence of a string of vehicles used in this secret space program.
3197000	3201000	Mark even illustrated the craft based on the eyewitnesses testimony.
3201000	3212000	Now under a loop looking at the original Polaroid, you can actually see a little bit more detail. This was a drawing done by the eyewitnesses of fellow who took the photograph.
3212000	3226000	And there were some things about it that I could probably go into, but the thing that's important to remember is that some of the features look remarkably like some of the structure on the so-called alien reproduction vehicle.
3226000	3239000	And in fact, it did it seem apparent to him that these wingtips, if you want to call them that, could actually rotate inward so that this thing would actually become more of a triangular shape, which also, of course, would help with issues like storage.
3239000	3244000	Now this is a little bit more detailed drawing than I did based on what I could see through the loop.
3244000	3253000	Near the end of the presentation, Mark circled back to the May 1989 East Germany crash recovery of a Lockheed Martin advanced aerospace vehicle.
3253000	3264000	This craft recovery is claimed to have been executed by special forces, ringing parallels to the numerous claims of JSOC units involved in foreign and domestic UAP crash retrieval operations.
3264000	3270000	Mark likened this craft to the F-117A stealth fighter utilizing stealth technologies.
3270000	3278000	The most interesting component of this craft were the three spheres on the underside of the craft appearing to be made of a white superconducting ceramic material.
3278000	3283000	The crash of this vehicle allegedly broke off the tail section, dislodging one of these spheres.
3283000	3290000	The pilot involved with the crash told Mark the retrieval team was ordered not to touch the sparking sphere with bare hands.
3290000	3299000	Mark theorized these spheres utilized some sort of cryogenic fluid to harness zero point energy systems, meaning the craft may have employed ARB systems.
3304000	3311000	When I finally did get around to making a copy of this original drawing in the form of Blueprint, I sent a copy to Brad.
3311000	3319000	And one of the first things that he said to me on the phone was, and he wasn't kidding when he said this, he said, you know, Mark,
3319000	3323000	he says this drawing is about as accurate as you can get.
3323000	3327000	He says every detail, every aspect of it is right on the money.
3327000	3329000	He said it is so accurate in every way.
3329000	3334000	He says this has to be probably one of the most dangerous illustrations you've ever done in your life.
3334000	3340000	And he says if you're smart, he says you'll tear up the original, you'll throw it away, and you'll never talk about it again.
3340000	3349000	After Mark appeared on the 2001 disclosure project speaking openly to the world about the alien reproduction vehicle, he got the strange feeling his activities were being monitored.
3349000	3356000	Mark was called and warned to stop doing what he was doing and one by one he lost all of his defense clients.
3356000	3364000	Mark reasoned he understood why some corporations and individuals may not have wanted to be associated with somebody speaking about flying saucers.
3364000	3369000	Further attacks would see Mark threatened on the phone and his money and cars taken by the IRS.
3369000	3379000	Mark would carry a heavy feeling of guilt and regret including Brad Sorensen's name, stating he was almost coerced by Dr. Greer not to protect names.
3379000	3387000	I mean, there's many times I lay awake at night with my 9mm under my pillow, he loaded, and I wonder why they haven't killed me.
3387000	3389000	And I honestly do.
3389000	3398000	As we discussed earlier, I have played many clips from the fantastic documentary Zero Point The Story of Mark McCandless and The Fluxliner by the late filmmaker James Allen.
3398000	3407000	This documentary discusses strange deaths of free energy pioneers such as fundamental physicist Stefan Marinov who fell out of a window in 1997.
3407000	3412000	Cold fusion researcher Eugene Malove who was beaten to death in 2004.
3412000	3418000	Zero Point Field Investor Arie de Goose who was found dead in his car in 2007.
3418000	3425000	And Star Drive inventor Mark Tomion who died unexpectedly in 2009 after a successful demonstration of his prototype.
3425000	3431000	The best example here is the case of Amy Eskridge which I may save for a future full investigation.
3431000	3438000	Dr. Amy Eskridge was a 35 year old scientist and co-founder of the Institute for Exotic Science in Huntsville, Alabama.
3438000	3443000	In 2022, Amy died in what was ruled a self-inflicted instance.
3443000	3447000	However, an incredible amount of controversy surrounds her passing.
3447000	3453000	Leading up to her death, Amy had been lecturing on behalf of Holocron Engineering, a gravity modification R&D company,
3453000	3462000	discussing historical anti-gravity experiments and modern black projects associated with developing the anti-gravity TR-3B craft.
3462000	3464000	Again, we'll save this for another time.
3464000	3469000	Mark admitted he had no idea what the ARV and these technologies were used for,
3469000	3474000	but he did state clandestine military operations may stop at nothing.
3474000	3478000	To prevent these technologies from leaking to the public and foreign adversaries,
3478000	3485000	and housing these programs alongside defense contractors would strengthen classification of programs utilizing these systems.
3485000	3490000	And these strange deaths very well may include James Hallen of the 2014 documentary.
3490000	3493000	The details around his death are highly suspicious.
3493000	3497000	This is the young man who produced the film that you'll probably have a chance to see later on, James Allen.
3497000	3499000	He's passed away now.
3499000	3505000	And this was literally just a month before the film was released.
3505000	3507000	And he suddenly became very sick.
3507000	3510000	He was in the hospital. He died within two and a half months.
3510000	3514000	And the manner of his illness was so peculiar and so strange.
3514000	3517000	We decided to go have some pathology done.
3517000	3521000	And what we found, it's really hard to see on this chart because it's so small.
3521000	3523000	I wish I could blow it up somehow.
3523000	3529000	But basically, all of these little things here we see and age next to those levels right there,
3529000	3538000	those are all radioisotopes like uranium, thorium, beryllium, cadmium, things that you would not find naturally occurring.
3538000	3542000	So it seems apparent to us that he was poisoned using radioisotopes.
3542000	3549000	And so I would like to dedicate this presentation to the memory of my friend James Allen.
3549000	3554000	He's a brilliant young man, had a great potential as a filmmaker ahead of him.
3554000	3558000	And I thank him for the time that he dedicated to documenting what I did.
3558000	3566000	On April 13, 2021, at the age of 69, Mark was found dead in his home from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
3566000	3572000	That day of April 13, Mark had spoken to his friend Rick Price and told him he would call him later.
3572000	3577000	Mark additionally spoke to his girlfriend and told her he would speak to her when he arrived to work at her animal shelter.
3577000	3587000	According to Robert D. Morningstar, Mark was supposed to testify to elements of the Senate on UAP in June of 2021 and had been in contact with Senator Rubio.
3587000	3589000	Was Mark's death truly his choice?
3589000	3593000	I am reminded of what Brad told me when I asked about Mark's death.
3593000	3594000	Quote,
3594000	3600000	Mark McCandlish was a stupid, dramatic, selfish fool who died because he could not keep his mouth shut.
3600000	3602000	Learn from this, end quote.
3602000	3608000	Why was Mark allowed to investigate and speak on the ARV from 1988 to 2021?
3608000	3613000	Was testifying to the Senate, possibly including Rubio and the gang of eight, the final straw?
3613000	3616000	I am again reminded of Brad's words, quote.
3616000	3620000	I protected him until I could not, end quote.
3621000	3630000	Hey guys, I know we ended on a very somber tone, so I would just like to take a moment to dedicate this video to the memory of James Allen and Mark McCandlish.
3630000	3634000	Without Mark's work and James Allen's work, none of this would have been possible.
3634000	3646000	I'd also highly recommend watching the 2004 documentary, Zero Point, and the story of the Fluxliner, as well as Stephen Greer's 2001 NPC and the interview with Mark titled Blueprint for a UFO.
3646000	3656000	If you didn't notice earlier, I would also highly recommend reading the 1990 interview with Bill Scott, the Senior Engineer of Aviation Week in Space Technology, and Brad Sorenson.
3656000	3661000	Now, after that massive investigation, what do you guys think?
3661000	3672000	I personally find the story of the ARV one of if the not most interesting stories in all of whatever you want to call it, ufology.
3672000	3681000	Even before the Schellenberger article with immaculate constellation and the mention of ARV, there was something about the McCandlish story that always stuck out to me.
3681000	3686000	The level of detail with which he described the Fluxliner as relayed by Brad.
3686000	3698000	And now after finding this interview with Brad, some of these small intricacies that Mark would say, this is how Brad acted, you know, usually he was very animated and quite, you know, lively.
3698000	3704000	And then in the interview with Bill Scott, we see, you know, Brad using foul language and being very descriptive.
3704000	3716000	I took special note of him kind of making fun of the designers of the ARV craft, saying clearly this was made by scientists, you know, Brad as an industrial designer and Mark as a designer.
3716000	3727000	They carry a certain swagger with their designs, sleek, beautiful, you know, especially Brad as coming from a car designer background, him just making fun of these scientists, saying it was clearly made by them.
3727000	3728000	Clearly made by them.
3728000	3739000	Now, I think the most shocking part of Brad's testimony in the 1990 interview is the statement of how these individuals in charge of the ARV got their hands on the craft.
3739000	3751000	Copy the technology couldn't figure out how it worked from somewhere in 1947 with others with beings that tried to take their technology off the board for humans.
3751000	3753000	It wasn't meant for us.
3753000	3770000	This harkens back to many stories in ufology about the Roswell craft, about humans getting their hands on technology forcefully and stories in the private sector about companies and scientists, not necessarily knowing how exactly these craft function.
3770000	3773000	And thus we get a poor man's copy in the ARV.
3773000	3780000	You know, we have these off shelf components, the synthetic vision system, the jump seat, the radial oxygen tanks.
3780000	3781000	It's quite interesting.
3781000	3792000	I also found it quite puzzling how Brad says he doesn't know who these craft belong to or what exactly they're for and report to.
3792000	3801000	You know, part of me thinks they wondering about the secret space program, the craft as Mark decided or described as possibly taking samples.
3801000	3818000	If for these kind of black budget operations, which may function in sort of a closed loop, you know, there are stories of these places, these places, facilities, programs operating in cash transactions and utilizing analog computers to completely stay off the books.
3818000	3828000	You know, one would must think how do these programs get their hands on materials, raw materials, metals, composite materials, you know, rare earth elements, lithium.
3828000	3831000	You know, this begs the question, what if these ARV craft?
3831000	3845000	What if one of their primary responsibilities is to, you know, visit the asteroid belt or near earth objects and kind of retrieve metals, precious metals for these programs to operate and continue their research and continue their development?
3845000	3847000	I'm just spitballing here.
3847000	3857000	Of course, the reality is probably much stranger, especially when we factor in stories to Edgar Foush and the TR3B for troop transport and logistics.
3857000	3864000	You know, does this secret space program have some sort of station across our solar system?
3864000	3870000	I also want to remove this secret space program away from sort of the more Corey Good 20 and back type stories.
3870000	3883000	Of course, some of these claims are quite fantastical, especially with Corey Good, the 20 and back story, which is essentially a story of indentured servitude to work side alongside extraterrestrials and humans in a space program.
3883000	3888000	Corey Good, the manufacturer of the story actually detailed these lies under oath.
3888000	3893000	So let's separate from those and we can take a much more grounded analysis to the secret space program.
3893000	3898000	Part of it may be for nuclear superiority in the secret space program talk.
3898000	3910000	Mark talked that the Aurora craft was actually a part of this program and the Aurora, you know, may have its place in this program due to the nuclear strike capabilities as Brad described.
3910000	3918000	And they could destroy any city in the Soviet Union with a population over one million in under two hours.
3918000	3925000	So how interesting is this, the combination of Mark McCandless's ARV with the entire testimony of Brad.
3925000	3935000	Now that we have words from Brad's mouth, you know, forget the guys of death threats towards me telling me that to say goodbye to everybody I love,
3935000	3939000	which to be quite honest, I wouldn't get too hard on Brad about this.
3939000	3947000	I think if anything, he's just probably trying to ward off amateur investigators off this case because there is a real and present danger here.
3947000	3954000	But being able to look at the story through Brad's words, you know, I can only think of two differences between Brad's and Mark's stories.
3954000	3962000	One of these in the secret space program talk, Mark spoke that the craft wasn't made of too much metal that most of it was composite materials.
3962000	3967000	In the interview with Brad, he mentioned that a lot, a lot of metal was used.
3967000	3975000	So this may have just been something that evolved over time, you know, maybe Brad thought the filaments on the crew compartment and composite materials were in fact metal and so forth.
3975000	3983000	Also, Brad stated in the interview, there wasn't many stars, so general ships there, but this was in relation to the first interview with some of the terrestrial craft.
3983000	3994000	He didn't actually specify if the generals were were present for the ARV demonstration, that interview, which Mark said the three star general was demonstrating the flight capabilities on the videotape.
3994000	4000000	So yeah, guys, we have the full story of ARV and this is just one facet of ARV.
4001000	4007000	We also have the full TR3B investigation dating back to Edgar Foush to go down.
4007000	4018000	And then we have a whole array of vehicles purported to be using NHI technology to some extent from artificial intelligence to full components and propulsion systems.
4018000	4029000	And I think there's a total of 10 to 15 of these alleged craft, of course, three of them being the flux liner, the Aurora craft and the mind skipping a blank here, the TR3B.
4029000	4032000	But we have plenty more to investigate with ARV.
4032000	4037000	This isn't just McCandlish, but this story was made famous by McCandlish.
4037000	4047000	So when Schellenberger mentions the story of ARV in the whistleblower report, I immediately think of these crude, jello saucers with jaggedy flight dynamics.
4047000	4051000	That can travel faster than light speeds.
4051000	4053000	Now, this is a very serious topic, guys.
4053000	4058000	I don't want to draw any attention to Mark's grieving family.
4058000	4072000	And of course, James Allen's presumably still grieving family, but it was worth kind of highlighting the strangeness around these passings, especially Mark possibly being, you know, set to testify in June of 2021 before congressional and Senate elements.
4072000	4074000	It begs the question.
4074000	4083000	Did Brad's protection of Mark, in whatever capacity and whatever facet that was, run out when Mark decided to testify before Congress?
4083000	4096000	Was it all fine and dandy for him to be running around with Greer and saying these things in documentaries and having fun, but as soon as it came time for him to be subpoenaed or to swear this under testimony that that was enough?
4096000	4099000	I don't know, but so much respect to Mark.
4099000	4101000	What a beautiful soul.
4101000	4111000	During these past couple weeks, I've got to watch dozens, if not 50 plus hours of Mark speaking, and he truly was a great loss to humanity.
4111000	4113000	What a beautiful artist.
4113000	4116000	What a beautiful, eloquent person.
4116000	4120000	And thank you, James Allen again for making such a beautiful documentary.
4120000	4122000	With this episode, guys, I hope you enjoyed it.
4122000	4125000	This was one of my favorite investigations ever to create.
4125000	4128000	And with that being said, please remember to like and subscribe.

4129000	4131000	I don't gatekeep any content there.

4139000	4145000	I do plan to attend the November 13th hearings and the Soul Foundation, so I should have live coverage from those boots on the ground.
4145000	4150000	But anyways, guys, with that being said, thank you so much for joining and I will catch you all in the next show.
4150000	4151000	Bye.
