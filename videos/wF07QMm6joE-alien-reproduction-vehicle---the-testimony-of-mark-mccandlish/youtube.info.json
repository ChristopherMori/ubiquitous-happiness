    "description": "In late 1988, accomplished aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish came into information that indicated the United States Government had antigravity craft reverse-engineered from non-human technology.\n\nThis information was relayed to mark from his good friend Brad Sorensen. Sorensen was wrongfully permitted access to a \"special exhibit\" at the November 12th, 1988 Norton Air Force Base air show.  Brad had witnessed strange craft - the losing competitor to the B2 Bomber, small hovercraft technology, and a flattened-out football known as the Lockheed Aurora.\n\nA secondary display showed three flying saucers known as Alien Reproduction Vehicles nicknamed \"Flux Liners\". The craft was capable of beyond-light speeds and had been reverse-engineered from off-shelf components from technology recovered from nonhuman intelligence.  \n\nLet's dive into the story of the flux liner, the physics behind the craft, other sightings of the craft, and most importantly, a long-forgotten 1990 interview with primary witness Brad Sorensen who not only confirms the ARVs, but adds even more astounding details.\n\n0:00 Intro\n03:39 Mark McCandlish & Brad Sorensen\n11:28 Alien Reproduction Vehicle\n19:39 Brad's Story\n32:06 McCandlish's ARV Investigation\n54:59 The Fate of Mark McCandlish\n1:00:00 Conclusion\n\nBlueprint for a UFO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua0MMXJl3FM\n\nMcCandlish press club: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DrcG7VGgQU&t=4408s \n\n2014 Zero Point Documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afLsRsd5roY \n\nMark's Death: https://gizadeathstar.com/2021/05/the-sad-and-mysterious-death-of-ufologist-mark-mccandlish/ \n\nInterview with Mark: https://ufospotlight.org/2021/05/10/an-interview-with-ufo-ssp-whistleblower-mark-mccandlish-on-advanced-energy-propulsion/ \n\n2015 Secret Space Program: Another video to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9smlCLjXoU&t=1314s \n\nReality Check W/ Michael Shellenberger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxyUoDvdGhg\n\nGary McKinnon: \n- https://web.archive.org/web/20160306030249/https://www.wired.com/2006/06/ufo-hacker-tells-what-he-found/ \n- https://web.archive.org/web/20061024221521/http://bbcworld.com/content/clickonline_archive_18_2006.asp?pageid=665&co_pageid=4 \n\nLANL Explosive Magnetic Flux Compression Generators: https://cyberwar.nl/d/1975_EMP_An-Introduction-to-Explosive-Magnetic-Flux-Compression-Generators.pdf \n\nAmy Eskridge: https://x.com/Alien_Scientist/status/1306981668419301379?t=sRPqtty0yk952ZsgEJa+Zww\n\nMoultrie: https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3249303/usdis-ronald-moultrie-and-dr-sean-kirkpatrick-media-roundtable-on-the-all-domai/ \n\nFOUCHE: \n- http://checktheevidencecom.ipage.com/checktheevidence.com/pdf/TR-3B%20questions%20and%20Answers.pdf \n- https://alienscientist.com/fouche.html \n\nNASA X-43: https://aviex.goflexair.com/blog/fastest-planes-in-the-world#:~:text=The%20NASA%20X%2D43%20holds,of%20air%2Dbreathing%20scramjet%20engines. \n\nTHIS VIDEO IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY! \nFAIR USE PRINCIPLES UNDER SECTION 107 OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT.\n\n#ufo #uap #uapnukes #uapdisclosure #ufology #ufonews #ufosightings #uapsightings #ufofootage #uapfootage #hynek #condoncomittee #Jallenhynek #projectsign #projectgrudge #projectbluebook #bluebook #ufocongress #SOL #solfoundation #karlnell #Battelle #UFOreverseengineering #lockheed #skunkworks #lockheedmartin #rosscoulthart #fastwalker #blackvault #slowwalker #kingman #ufocrash #nickredfern #Grusch #Magenta #michaelherrera #USO #TimothyGallaudet #mystery #mysteries #unexplained #extraterrestrial #space #technology #greer #kecksburg #kecksburgUFO #nasa #edwards #usaf #elizondo #arv #McCandlish",
