1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
When you hear of a program called the Off-World Technologies Division, you might think of the

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,000
U.S. Army's brief in-house group known as the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit that analyzed UFOs

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,280
in the 1950s. Or maybe you think of the U.S. Air Force's foreign technology division initially

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,480
achieved by Colonel Philip J. Corso, who stated technology such as night vision and fiber optics

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,400
were reverse engineered for the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash. Whatever you think of when you

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,440
hear of the Off-World Technologies Division, there is a first-hand witness who can shed

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,080
light on this never-before-heard-of, non-human-intelligence technology exploitation program.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,280
A witness whose claims can be backed by his U.S. Army Green Beret and Special Forces credentials

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,240
and verified placement where he claims this anomalous division is stored. It was within

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,080
this division stored at the Naval Surface Weapon Center in Crane, Indiana. Green Beret witness

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:01,120
R.A. observed recovered technology not made by human hands. Technology so profound,

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,560
strange, and advanced, it seemed the Navy and a certain private company's best and brightest

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,560
could not begin to comprehend this tech. What's going on guys, it's UAP Gerb, and thank you so

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,960
much for joining me today as we hear from for the first time ever, the first-hand witness testimony

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,000
of Special Forces member R.A. in his claims of an Off-World Technologies Division at the NSWC Crane.

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,160
R.A.'s testimony may reveal a disturbing and monumental UFO reverse engineering program

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,680
nestled within the Navy's premier special weaponry installation. Join me as we conduct an

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,680
astounding primary investigation into R.A. his claims and a private defense contractor likely

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,440
involved with UFO technology reverse engineering programs.

20
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,480
To start, who exactly is R.A. and why should his testimony be heard? R.A. is easily the most

21
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,200
accomplished and credentialed U.S. soldier I have ever had the pleasure of speaking to. R.A.

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,280
is a U.S. Army Special Forces operator, aka a Green Beret, who served within the first Special Forces

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,040
Airborne Command. He served as an 18 Bravo weapon sergeant, a key element to any Special Forces

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,360
division described by the U.S. Army as one of the most highly skilled soldiers in the world.

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,920
18 Bravos are tasked with operating and maintaining an array of weaponry, including small arms,

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,000
heavy weapons, bombs, and mines, communications equipment, and must be able to employ conventional

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,680
and unconventional warfare tactics, and guys this is key. Operate and maintain both allied

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,080
and foreign weaponry. His Special Forces accolades have been thoroughly vetted,

29
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,920
with R.A. providing a full list of his certifications as well as his DD 214. He also

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,920
completed SEAR, Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape High-Risk Training at Level C,

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,960
which is the hardest and most challenging SEAR course. The witness even completed the U.S.

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,240
Army's ALC, or Advanced Learning Course, and earned a T.S.S.C.I. Top Secret Sensitive

33
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,000
Compartmented Information Security Clearance. I was connected to R.A. through mutual contacts,

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,360
who told me that this R.A. wanted to help disclosure, wanted to tell about his experience,

35
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:26,080
but wanted to remain anonymous. Between 2013 and 2015, R.A. was sent to the Naval

36
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,520
Surface Warfare Center, located in Crane, Indiana, to train with advanced foreign and domestic

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,360
weapon technologies, and their implementation into the armed forces.

38
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,280
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC, as I'll be referring it to for the rest of this video,

39
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,560
is part of the Naval Support Activity Crane, alongside the U.S. Army Ammunition Activity,

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,920
which stockpiles much of the U.S. mainland's munitions. Crane, Indiana was chosen for these

41
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,880
stockpile duties during World War II, as such a landlocked state location would be difficult to

42
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,120
be targeted by enemy forces. Quote, NSA Crane, home to one of the nation's most important

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,680
military laboratories, is sometimes referred to as the Pentagon's best-kept secret, end quote,

44
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,320
Senator Joe Donnelly, Indiana. NSWC is an enormous facility, with several underground layers

45
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,280
highlighted as the premier Navy lab, whose mission is to, quote, provide acquisition and

46
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,800
in-service engineering and technical support for sensors, electronics, electronic warfare,

47
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,280
and special warfare weapons, end quote. Operations at Crane are divided into three

48
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,120
distinct focus areas, strategic missions, electronic warfare, and expeditionary warfare.

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,280
But this location doesn't focus just on conventional missions, such as we see in this

50
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,600
recent Duke University research funding announcement titled Long Range Broad Agency

51
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,560
announcement for NSWC Crane. A key focus of Crane programs are advanced concepts and technologies.

52
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,560
NSWC Crane is best described as a Navy federal laboratory with a reputation for national

53
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,680
technical leadership, and a Navy lab that works directly with warfighters to create

54
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,360
comprehensive, innovative solutions at the speed of relevance. The underground presence of this

55
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,800
base is also key to mention here moving forward. Not only are there numerous underground bunkers

56
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,760
for munitions storage hidden below the ground, but also small arms testing resources such as an

57
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,240
underground 100-meter firing range. The naval support activity location holds over 3,000 buildings

58
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,160
spanning 64,000 acres above ground. NSWC Crane is deeply tied to private defense contractors,

59
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,720
employing over 2,489 private contract workers, including one in specific, we will mention in

60
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,400
a little bit. As mentioned before, RA was at Crane to test advanced foreign and domestic weaponry.

61
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,120
The Crane facility has historically worked closely with the U.S. Army for weapons testing,

62
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,160
training, and defensive capabilities, such as countering improvised explosive devices in Iraq.

63
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,360
And the NSWC is no stranger to reverse engineering, quote, critical technology to maintain fleet

64
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,720
readiness, end quote, such as this black box that was, quote, unknown how it was constructed,

65
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,680
functioned, or how to repair it, end quote. This device was successfully reverse engineered by

66
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,240
electromagnetic warfare experts and designated as critical technology in an AN-SLQ-32 or

67
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,400
SLIC-32 component, a ship-board electronic warfare suite. Also interesting and worthy of note,

68
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,080
NSWC has to adhere to DOD guidebooks for, quote, situations such as this, end quote.

69
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,760
So let's hear from RA for the first time. In his words, why was he at Crane?

70
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,360
It was for a weapons course. So we were, we were specifically going there to train up on the new

71
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,000
Maygun setup and a couple other, like, SOCOM weapons that were coming in, coming online,

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,360
like iterations to the SCAR, so some cases that were coming in, and then also to get educated on

73
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,880
some of the enemy technology. So whenever we'd be training like that, that's like TSSCI level

74
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,920
stuff. They'll have stuff that's, for example, they'll have a description of the course and what

75
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,520
you're going to do, and then all the stuff that's going to, that you're going to get taught that's

76
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:22,400
not able to be written down or, you know, exposed. It'll be, they'll explain that in a different

77
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,400
way. So I would say that. It's like, we knew we were going to get exposed to some other

78
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,840
foreign weapons that they had, they had recently recovered, and we were supposed to kind of just

79
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,920
help provide an input on what we thought about those systems. And they did have them there. They

80
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,040
had some Russian weapons that had bullets that they were, they think they could, Russian force

81
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,200
firing with biologics and bullets. And so we had, we were doing some stuff with that. And so it was,

82
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,800
it was looking at other foreign weapon systems that they were, they were spinning around with,

83
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,000
and the CIA operatives had captured and that they go back to Crain. So if you think about it, like

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,920
whatever mechanism they have, logistically, to get that shit from wherever they found it to Crain,

85
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,280
why would they not use that same apparatus to get whatever else they find?

86
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,040
RA was told that out of his class of about 10, him and only one other soldier with TSSCI clearance

87
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,920
would be taken to see the interesting stuff, the quote, foreign adversarial tech.

88
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,720
Yes. So the way that it was kind of weird how that happened, there was only, so there was a

89
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,480
bunch of us in the class, I forget, I mean, you saw a picture, there was only two of us in that

90
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:35,920
group that had a TSSCI level clearance at the time. And those were the two, we were the two that

91
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,280
got taken to see the other stuff. So they were, the rest of the class didn't see the foreign weapons

92
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,640
they were back in engineering or the awful technology that they had exposed us to. So

93
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,800
nobody else saw that. And then we were also told not to mention next to the rest of the class

94
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,640
that we were the ones getting exposed to that technology. So

95
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,800
after observing tech considered disruptive, such as the experimental Russian bullets RA spoke of,

96
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,120
him and his fellow soldier were taken deep underground to a location that stood out from

97
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,960
the rest of Crain, appearing pristine and quite advanced. We went down into like an R&D area,

98
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:20,160
that's where it had on-vrooms. So the on-vroom is going to be like an extra layer of security,

99
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,200
right? And then, so it's kind of what it was, we went through a couple checkpoints. I mean,

100
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,480
I remember going through like a door to get to a door to get to that, like that kind of

101
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,560
like compartmentalized, like whether who knows what they were scanning, I don't know,

102
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,680
they're probably checking us for whatever. Obviously, it was like considered like a scare.

103
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,760
So we give up all electronics and everything before we even went down there. So I mean,

104
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,600
you're scrubbed, you know, everything possibly, you don't have anything that could take a note with

105
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,440
or something, you know, you're scrubbed with everything. So then you go through, we went down

106
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,320
the elevator, and like I said, it was, I could tell you're a lower pretty low, because I remember

107
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,880
it being like one outside and then down there it was really cold, just because of the depths.

108
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,840
So we had to be some significant amount below the surface, I don't know how far at all, but

109
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,320
um, and then I went through the checkpoints and then into an arms room area, which is what we're

110
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,480
shocking about again, is that all of crane was old and dilapidated and beat up. I mean, it looks like

111
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,680
in 1970s facility, and you go underground in this area, and it was like a spaceship, you know,

112
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,320
not literally, but I mean, it was so much more advanced than the stuff up top. Like you can

113
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,760
tell this is where the, the shit happened. You know, this is where they maintained and

114
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,800
upgraded and continued to work and all the other stuff that just kind of like let look like shit

115
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,680
on purpose problem. Nothing in crane was labeled. All the buildings were, I mean, like really basic

116
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:59,280
looking. When we were under, in that particular area, there was, there was labeling on like

117
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,280
different areas. So there was like, I remember seeing a couple signs, I don't know what they

118
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,400
said, I mean, so long ago now, but um, yeah, there was like signage like saying what part you were

119
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,320
in. And what struck me is why I remember that, I think, is because like, I was thinking how big is

120
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,720
this underground area that they have to label where you're at, you know, because if you think about it,

121
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,200
I mean, if we just took an elevator down to the area that was small, then why would you label it?

122
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,240
Oh, this is where you are here. And it felt like it was falling, not like it was this one little area,

123
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,560
you know, it was under the NSWC crane, RA would arrive to observe the off world technologies

124
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:46,800
division. RA was told by his guide, a private contractor, former military and the same individual

125
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,240
leading the weapons training, quite nonchalantly that they were entering the quote, off world

126
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,000
technologies division end quote. And before he expands on an I asked RA his initial reaction

127
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,840
when he was told quite casually about the division's name. Well, I mean, I was a trained

128
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,320
green beret, so my reaction was stoic, but when I got back to the hotel, I was freaking out.

129
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,920
I mean, because up to that point, I had, I had believed in like, obviously that there were,

130
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,240
you know, probably aliens out there, probably life out there in the universe, of course,

131
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,120
just statistically speaking, but I never thought that I wouldn't have gone as far as if they'd

132
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,040
been here or any of that. But to then to see that these guys were talking about like, was like,

133
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,920
over a coffee break. I was really surprised by that. And me and the other guy had a great

134
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,480
conversation about it when we got back. And it was kind of just like, now what? Because

135
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,040
like the whole world is different to me. And it took me a lot of years. I thought about that for

136
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,240
a lot of years, just was this mean for me, you know? Yeah, I mean, there's a part of me that

137
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,440
was grateful that I got that I know, but that I know I can at least within myself, I can say,

138
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,120
I know that there's another life out there, you know, and I know it because

139
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,240
I was exposed to it in this way. However, that happened. Now I know, you know, and that's,

140
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,880
I'm grateful for that. But at the same time, I don't know what the cost of that's going to end

141
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,360
up being, you know, upon entering this unlabeled division, RA did not enter a normal firing range

142
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,800
or laboratory. He and the other men were greeted to what seemed like a scientific observation

143
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,360
room overseeing a laboratory housing two pieces of technology. So it was, it was basically the

144
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,560
way I would describe it is like a viewing room. And I think it was, you can imagine, like they're

145
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,640
probably we're going to do different types of experiments on these objects and, and the area

146
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,360
that they kept it in or stored it in, you know, or maybe they will just have this setup to be a

147
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,640
piece to come through and look at it, people that weren't there, we're going to the people

148
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,800
that know about this technology. I don't know. But it's clearly set up in a way that

149
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,840
you could see the room that it was displayed in a way that was looked like it was displayed.

150
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,920
I don't know. It was very, it's very possible that they were, it was both on that stuff and

151
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,720
somebody would have drove them from the area we were in. solely RA, the other green beret,

152
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,480
the guide and one staff member were present. The contractor present was quote, pretty normally

153
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,240
dressed and quote, appearing similar to a normal lab technician. One of these devices displayed

154
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,480
was a sphere no bigger than a basketball and seemingly constructed from seamless metal.

155
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,840
Yeah, I don't know. So hard to describe. It just, it looked unnatural. The, the sphere itself was on

156
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:35,120
like a podium type of thing. And it, from what I could see, it didn't look like it was connected

157
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,360
to the podium. It looked like it was almost repelled off the podium. It was a very, it was a

158
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:50,640
awkwardly, like almost looked liquid, but it was clearly metallic, seamless.

159
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,080
It just didn't look natural, man. Like if you, if you took a chrome ball the same size,

160
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,680
chrome sphere, polish it up and put it in that room, it would look different than that.

161
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,640
But I can't tell you how, because I don't have anything to reference to that.

162
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,640
It just didn't look right. It didn't look, it looked different than anything I've ever seen.

163
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,440
If you brought that ball in a room to me right now, I was like, this is from another world.

164
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,920
Nobody would doubt that. Everybody in the room would probably be like, yeah, that's something

165
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,320
weird about that, you know? I wondered if this sphere's surface description was similar to the

166
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,320
mother of pearl effect Lance Corporal Jonathan Weighant claimed to have observed from the

167
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,880
crashed UAP in Peru in 1997. RA described this sphere as extremely clear, and the mother of

168
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,120
pearl effect could be accurate if we utilize an oil on water analogy, but with the oil being clear.

169
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,080
RA claimed the sphere had an indent on top that almost looked like where one would put a hand,

170
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,640
but did not get a crystal clear look at this.

171
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,040
About the size of the hand, I wouldn't say there was forehand,

172
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,680
because that would be, I mean, that's my human interpretation of what I would think it would

173
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,280
do, you know? RA's guide told him and the other Green Beret this object and the other piece of

174
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,720
technology somehow interacted with human consciousness. Both the audience they had under

175
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,560
there, they said somehow interacted with consciousness in it, and the way he said it,

176
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:25,680
and it was why it gets so fuzzy. He said, I wouldn't quote these things, because I'm kind of trying

177
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:33,600
to just remember the context, and I can, again, like when I meditate, I think about this, I can

178
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,120
usually get more back, but just like sitting here talking and remembering it, it's difficult sometimes.

179
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,760
But I remember him saying, we don't understand quite how to operate the systems or how they,

180
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,520
but they do interact with consciousness. So certain, and some people they interact with,

181
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,200
and some people they don't. So certain people will go up to the object and it will respond,

182
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,720
and some people go up to the object and it does nothing. So certain types, I don't know if that's

183
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,320
related to DNA or to consciousness or whatever, but it's different people will have a different

184
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:12,000
response, and they, they has kind of walked closer to the window, and nothing happened. So we didn't,

185
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,880
I mean, I don't know if we got closer to something would have happened, but I don't know if they

186
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,000
were even looking for that. But maybe, you know, that's one thing he said that like certain people

187
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,880
will go near the object and it will react. He didn't describe how it would react, he said it would react.

188
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,160
RA states, once he began to view the pieces of technology, his recollection of these events

189
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,480
becomes somewhat fuzzy. There's a really weird component to this, and I don't know what this

190
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,680
means. But when I think back to this particular memory, and this never happens to me in any other

191
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:47,040
thing, I get real fuzzy. It gets real fuzzy, like almost like something was purposely done to make

192
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,520
it that way. Because I have a very photographic memory and things I've done in the military,

193
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,800
like I can tell you the color, the buttons on a shirt of a guy, I snipe from, you know, 800 meters away.

194
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:06,720
So, I mean, for me to not remember this is really bothers me, but there's some cloudiness when I

195
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,440
try to access this part of my brain, you know. Maybe it could definitely be the

196
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,000
objects themselves that have been. It felt, this is why it's a good quote, because obviously,

197
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,280
it felt weird being down there, okay? There's something like, there was just, it's an unnatural

198
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,200
feeling. It felt like we were doing something that wasn't normal. I mean, the fact that we were so

199
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,600
deep underground, me and the dude were kind of freaked out, but we didn't display that

200
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,040
outwardly, because we're trained to not do that. But internally, I was like, what the hell is going

201
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,400
on? And when they talk about awkward stuff, they didn't say it like, by the way, aliens are real,

202
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,800
like you're anything like of that sort. It was just, oh yeah, this is the awkward technology

203
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,520
division. This is Chuck, this is whatever. And just started talking like everything was normal.

204
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,640
And we just went along with it because we hadn't thought it was normal. But the first time I'd

205
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,920
ever been exposed to it. And it was a lot to take in. So that can be part of it too.

206
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,280
Immediately, let's recall the infographics witness whistleblower who claimed anchors were

207
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,280
utilized by UAP recovery operators to keep them quote grounded in reality. Dr. Gary Nolan has

208
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,360
also done extensive research into the effect of UAP on human cognition. Whatever the phenomenon is,

209
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,560
it's capable of manipulating human perception, human consciousness. Right.

210
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,280
The other piece of technology R.A. observed is very difficult to describe. He sees it almost as

211
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,920
a tablet similar to a gauntlet, something you would put your arm inside. R.A. stated this

212
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,440
second device was referred to as a piece of weapon technology, due to the tech producing an energetic

213
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,280
discharge during recovery. And same with the other the other thing that looked like something you

214
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,440
would put your arm inside, as I described. And supposedly with some type of weapon system that

215
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,240
they had recovered from the craft, they knew as a weapon system because it had it had discharged

216
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,000
or something, an energy pulse. And they just had talked about that briefly. But all this was like

217
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,960
third party saying what they had heard about the object. So they were talking about it between

218
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,600
the two guys that worked there. And I think they exposed more than they were supposed to in just

219
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,440
in their conversation. And I don't know that they weren't really trying to be

220
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
much secure with what they were saying. They're pretty comfortable or they've been

221
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,080
dealing with this stuff for a while. And this wasn't a big deal to them. So that that was awfully,

222
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,760
as you can imagine, because I'm getting exposed to something that's telling me that everything I

223
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,840
believe about the world is different. And I'm freaking out inside. And these guys were talking

224
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,800
about it like it's no big deal. Like we're at lunch. He said that it was an uncomfortable feeling.

225
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,160
But yeah, he he described this stuff. Because I don't remember asking questions.

226
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,120
I'll never be like, well, what's it what how did you know this weapon? How do you know that's

227
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,120
a weapon? And he said, Oh, they had discharged in the process of them recovering it, that they

228
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,120
had discharged an energy pulse or something. Somebody was injured in the process. And they were

229
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,760
talking about it a little bit. And then the guy would be like, Oh, remember, they had something

230
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,320
other guy would be like, Oh, yeah. And then he was taken to that hospital or whatever.

231
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,440
They were talking about it like they were filling each other reminding each other of

232
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,640
something about the incident, you know, and that's how we got the information.

233
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,320
This weapon technology device was projecting a type of writing that reminded RA of hieroglyphics.

234
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,720
I don't know how to describe that man.

235
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,880
Almost hieroglyphic, I guess.

236
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,120
RA didn't ask about this writing. He wondered if it was even real due to no noticeable projection

237
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,600
mechanisms on the device and thought if the characters were actually being displayed into his

238
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:53,200
mind. But during our conversations together, I did run many of the famous symbols and iconography

239
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,440
from ufology by RA, such as the famous Roswell I beam, allegedly found amongst the Roswell wreckage

240
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,440
depicting NHI symbolism or language. It wasn't until I got to a relatively obscure reference that

241
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,520
RA identified iconography similar to what he saw. In 2021, Luella Zando's attorney,

242
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,760
Daniel Sheehan, made some startling remarks at UFO mega con. Sheehan claimed in 1977,

243
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,640
under orders from President Jimmy Carter, who did have a verifiable interest in UAP,

244
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,920
to scour classified portions of Project Blue Book. Now, we've talked extensively about

245
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,480
classified programs parallel to Blue Book, so I will skip that for now, but immediately the

246
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,240
testimony of Steven Lovekin comes to mind. Amongst the boxes of materials, Sheehan claimed to have

247
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,800
come across a series of five or six photographs depicting a downed saucer-shaped UAP, quote,

248
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,080
there were maybe five or six in this series of photographs and it hit in this field that had

249
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,960
snow on it and it plowed through this big ditch and you could see across this field and it was

250
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,320
stuck in the side of this embankment, end quote. Something about these images really stuck out

251
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,240
to Sheehan, quote, here's the semicircle of the craft, like this and the edges here, and they were

252
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,120
a series of these straight lines with dashes and dots and little horseshoe shapes like this, and

253
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,400
they went all the way around the bottom. But that's exactly what they looked like. And it didn't look

254
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,800
like the ones at Roswell. These are different. Now, I don't remember in which order they were

255
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,920
or the exact sequence, but that's exactly what the shapes were and it was all around,

256
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,640
right around the base of the dome of the saucer. I could tell they were Air Force guys because it

257
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,680
was snowing and they had these big furry hoods on with their jackets and stuff. And you could tell

258
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,320
that they were really excited. You could tell from looking at them as they were photographing this

259
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,600
thing, end quote. RA states the symbols Sheehan drew look quite close to the symbols projected

260
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,240
from this anomalous technology. And guys, real fast, we do know Blue Book ran from 52 to 69.

261
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,960
And since these images are from a classified section of Blue Book, can we factor in the

262
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,080
USAF soldiers and snow to try and determine a recovery event? Of course, this isn't the topic

263
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,240
of today's video. But let's just take a quick peek. One such possibility is the 1952 Spitzberg

264
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,120
in Norway event I will cover in the future. Interesting story here that has some confusing

265
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,240
pathways and possible misinformation. Most of what we know here is that the CIA took an

266
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,720
interest in reports of a crashed 47 meter disk. Besides this Norway case, not many fit our conditions,

267
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,800
so possibly this was actually a retrieval operation that was kept under wraps.

268
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,480
After a short time, the two green berets were escorted out of the offworld technologies division.

269
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
We were escorted out the same way we were escorted in. We went back to the training

270
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:49,840
room until we had been working in and we had a brief, like debrief, like a quick debrief with

271
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,640
the guy. I think I remember, I don't remember if that's when we signed some stuff or not. Did you

272
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,240
sign anything? And I was like, I don't remember particularly, but afterwards I thought about

273
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,520
it as like, I do think we were signing something. But that's not, we do that all the time with

274
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,280
everything. It's always just handpaper to you to sign in the military. So it would be hard to

275
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,560
pinpoint like, yeah, at this moment we signed an NDA. I probably signed 10 NDAs then didn't know.

276
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,920
We were escorted out. We talked about it briefly and then me and the guy had walked back to the

277
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,240
parking area together. We were going back to the same hotel. We were talking about it. We were

278
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,360
actually staying in the same hotel. So we got back, we talked about it a little and we were

279
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,960
both freaked out by the whole thing. Getting back to their hotel, R.A. and his fellow soldier

280
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,720
experienced some real ontological shock. R.A. and I are trying to get in contact with the other

281
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,840
soldier. After this event, the two lost contact due to not being stationed together. And R.A. even

282
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,640
heard rumors the other soldier was killed during a combat operation. We were both in that same,

283
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,440
like he was like, what the fuck? You know, that's, that's where we were. I mean, we go back,

284
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,560
got back to the hotel and was like, what the fuck? Like, what was that? He's like, so this is all

285
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,960
real? Like, we're, we're going through that whole thing, you know? Well, I haven't seen him in years.

286
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,080
I try to track him down to talk to him about this. And I wasn't able to find him or get a hold of him

287
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,960
or how does that picture? We weren't, we weren't stationed together. We didn't serve together.

288
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,080
We were in two far apart units. And, you know, we never was able to find him. And somebody told

289
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,800
me he passed and on a mission and that he was going, I don't know. So I don't, I don't know

290
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,400
any other way. But I mean, I never spoke to him after that our time together there.

291
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,160
After his experience, R.A. did not contact Arrow nor did he contact David Grush,

292
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,520
Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon, or any of these notable figures. R.A. did not want his name

293
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,680
known publicly. To this day, R.A. performs op for opposing force training exercises for special

294
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:00,720
forces units at Area 51. The stuff I do with DOE, Department of Energy, Area 51, they control that

295
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,320
land. They hold all the contracts up there. And I'm here and I have a TSSI that was active for

296
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,240
12 years. So they'll pull me in and help you train projects. During his training operations,

297
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,200
R.A. has been exposed to all types of advanced drone technology, including sphere drones. He says

298
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,320
have often been mistaken for UAP and drones disguised as local fauna during the invasion of

299
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,480
Syria. He estimates many modern UAP sightings, not all, but especially orbs are in fact highly

300
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,400
advanced military drones. I've been exposed to drone technology. I still work, I do work out

301
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,480
at various, it's more indicationally still. So like some of the orb technology and so I've seen it.

302
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,560
It's not that cool to me anymore. I don't really care. A lot of the stuff that people are seeing

303
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:53,120
is our shit. So but and this really piques my interest. R.A. has also heard of human made

304
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,320
triangular craft that operate off of a electro gravitic propulsion. For anyone who wants to

305
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,400
learn more about electro gravitics, I highly recommend checking out my friend Jesse Michaels

306
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,600
video, the scientist who built UFOs for the CIA starting at about 17 minutes and five seconds.

307
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,560
Due to a trusted military contact, citing of a triangular shaped craft, R.A. estimates there

308
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,320
are human made triangle shaped craft and NHI based triangle shaped craft. Is this a possible

309
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,320
reference to the reverse engineered TR-3B? No, I don't think it was either. I think it was completely

310
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,880
foreign, alien, whatever. By the way he described it, the time frame he's talking about, just the

311
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,800
way he described it is there's some differences because I asked specific questions that I knew

312
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:46,160
to ask and it wasn't the same. For example, the lighting underneath our craft is incandescent

313
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,120
or it might be something more advanced, but it's almost like an incandescent light. So it's turned

314
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:58,640
on and off with a switch, you know. The lighting that he described was like always on and responded

315
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,760
to the ship. So I guess the ship would do stuff. You said the lights would brighten the dim. Like

316
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,680
he said windows are wasn't even one solid and he drew all this stuff down. He just said it was

317
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,120
seven or eight, maybe nine lights that went along the perimeter of the triangle

318
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,280
and which are our craftfulness three than I thought, you know. And so this he said had multiple

319
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,840
and the size was also the big one. He said it was like the size of three football fields.

320
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,360
They're not years at times. And that's just his guess. And it was simply the sound like ours

321
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,640
give off a fucking weird sound through these drones, human made triangles and other human

322
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,400
made technology are a has seen some truly impressive military tech. But in his own words,

323
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,360
all of this pales in comparison to what he observed at the offworld technology division.

324
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:59,280
So RA, a green beret and 18 bravo weapons specialist was sent for weapons training to the

325
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,560
naval surface weapons center in Crane, Indiana, whose mission is to provide the American war

326
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,280
fighter with the solutions to their toughest technical challenges to better equip a decisive

327
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,920
advantage in electromagnetic warfare, strategic missions and expeditionary warfare. Here he

328
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,400
learned about domestic and advanced weapon technologies and their implementation into the

329
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,480
modern battlefield. Due to his TS SCI clearance, RA was taken with a fellow green beret to Crane's

330
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,880
underground section to view more classified tech. His guide, a skinny private contractor employee

331
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,640
took the men to a secluded section of crane titled the offworld technologies division. Here,

332
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,200
RA was shown tech made by non human intelligence. Technology cranes best and brightest had no idea

333
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,760
how to operate. Technology possibly considered to be weaponry. Tech RA was told interacted with a

334
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:59,760
conscious being. NSWC crane employs a whopping 2489 contracting force and does business with

335
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,520
numerous defense companies. But one company stands out from the rest due to their historical

336
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:12,400
implication with UAP programs, research into human consciousness and massive contracts with Crane,

337
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,360
science applications, international corporation SAIC was started in 1969 and has historically

338
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:26,160
specialized in information technology, engineering and defense, enjoying numerous massive contracts

339
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:32,000
with the Department of Defense. But before we get started a few things, one I need to mention my

340
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,760
good friend Kermit for helping me out with the SAIC research. He specializes in researching

341
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,920
specifically SAIC so the man is a genius, you can find him on Reddit as frog in badger,

342
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,280
his link to his profile will be in the video description. Two, I need to mention the testimony

343
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:55,760
of former SAIC employee Denise McKenzie, who appeared on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure

344
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,440
briefing document. McKenzie stated that in the hundreds of millions of dollars awarded to SAIC

345
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,080
for government contracts, most contracts had almost zero associated activity. She surmised that

346
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,600
black budget money is hidden within legitimate programs and contacts. After discussing these

347
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,480
discrepancies and contracts, McKenzie faced harassment within the company. The key to

348
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,800
beginning this investigation is analyzing the massive contracts SAIC has enjoyed with NSWC

349
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:33,040
Crane for myriad purposes, such as this 2024 $63 million contract to support NSWC Crane's

350
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,720
hypersonic advanced concepts. Weird how this article must be accessed on the web archive,

351
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,920
SAIC's internal site pulled this link down around June of 2024. Or how about this 2023

352
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:54,160
$240 million IDIQ, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity SAIC contract to support Crane's

353
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,760
Weapon Division instrumentation platform. Weird how this link also disappeared around January

354
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:08,000
of 2024. Another article pulled off of SAIC's site is this 2020 $133 million contract providing

355
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,880
mission engineering and integration support for maneuver, engagement, and surveillance

356
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,840
section of Crane. And these are just a few contracts, there are many more of interest,

357
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:25,280
such as this 2010 $351 million contract for SAIC to provide technical engineering

358
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:31,440
services to NSWC Crane. This specific contract aimed to support the Joint Special Operations

359
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,600
Response Department, JSOC. If you've never heard of JSOC well, this is the department

360
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,720
named alongside the CIA's Office of Global Access tasked with UAP crash retrieval and

361
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,560
collections. Another video for another day, guys. SAIC's connections to Crane are so massive,

362
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,400
we can find myriad modern day job opportunities as a contractor there. And what you may not know

363
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,480
is the intimate relationship between SAIC and Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, former head of Aero. The good

364
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,240
doctor has actually published patents under the company. SAIC has even participated in weapons

365
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,760
testing at Crane, quote, our team is right in the midst of that, providing expertise and quote,

366
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,280
said Diane Wilson, who manages support for the Small Arms contract. She heads a highly skilled

367
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,480
passionate team that she describes as, quote, totally focused on bringing the best technology

368
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,840
and the best weapons into the hands of the warfighter, end quote. Sounds very similar to the

369
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,800
claims of RA's contractor who was instructing the Green Berets on weapons testing, does it not?

370
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,800
So what about SAIC's connection to UAP, reverse engineering, and key here, consciousness related

371
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,800
technology? Well, to start, SAIC is eligible under the DoD's corporate portfolio program.

372
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,320
Remember how David Grush had private contractors work hand in hand with DoD elements on UAP

373
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,200
programs nestled within special access programs? Well, the corporate portfolio program gives

374
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,400
defense industrial based corporations like SAIC access to DoD executives, scientists, and management

375
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:09,200
with broad access to special access program portfolios. If this NHI weapons testing program

376
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,880
is being siloed to the Navy at Crane and SAIC, this is likely a set of contracts that falls

377
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,680
under systems engineering and technical assessment slash research and development,

378
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,080
with money split between acknowledged and unacknowledged special access programs.

379
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,160
And with the slightest bit of research, we can see that the corporate portfolio program was

380
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,600
established in 2020 by former Under Secretary for Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen

381
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:40,560
Lorde. After leaving the Pentagon in 2021, she joined SAIC as a strategic advisor.

382
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,080
And this brings me back to that 2020 $133 million contract providing mission engineering and

383
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,440
integration services for the maneuver, engagement, and surveillance division of Crane. We observe this

384
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,280
contract with Crane is an R&D project and falls under special warfare and expeditionary systems.

385
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,120
One subset of the contract is the Special Capabilities Branch of Crane. Does this specific

386
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,280
contract highlight money going towards the Off-World Technology division? And the connection

387
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,440
here gets even more exact and more strange. To mention briefly, SAIC even published a paper

388
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,840
around 1990 titled Electric Propulsion Study. This study, referenced by Jesse Michaels relating to

389
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,760
T. Townsend Brown in UAP Propulsion, discusses electrogravity. A propulsion mechanism mentioned

390
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,160
by RA and often associated with human attempts at NHI craft, such as the Fluxliner Allege Reverse

391
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,080
Engineered Craft, or ARV, mentioned by aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish, which operated off

392
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:44,000
of electrogravity propulsion. But does anybody remember the CIA Stargate program in the 1970s

393
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,440
and 1980s? The program aimed to study the potential of remote viewing and psychic phenomena for

394
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,840
military applications. This program spearheaded by defense contractor SRI International was

395
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:02,160
terminated in 1995 due to the program claiming it had no useful results. There was a corporation

396
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,040
doing parallel research into such mental phenomena and consciousness research around this time,

397
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:15,200
and yes, you guessed it, SAIC. SAIC also continued to study these subjects post-1995 when the programs

398
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,440
moved out of the military. Diving into this territory is somewhat uncomfortable for me,

399
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,440
but let's remember David Grush discussing the Stargate program on JRE.

400
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,840
We seem to just possess other skills. I mean, it goes back to like the Stargate program, right,

401
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:36,000
you know, with Declassified by Clinton and sensibly canceled, I guess, in 1996, you know,

402
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,280
where you had people trained in remote viewing and like there was feedback loops to confirm what

403
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,800
they saw was real and either satellite imagery or human sources where they sketched out a room

404
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,120
of where there's hostages and they got a hostage out and they're like, and this is a real story,

405
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,800
actually. And Ross Colthart in his Reddit Ask Me Anything stating one word we should be paying

406
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,560
attention to is psionic. And of course, the dictionary definition for psionic is the practical

407
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,240
use of psychic powers or paranormal phenomena. Right off the bat, there are three extremely

408
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,560
impactful SAIC studies I want to mention, protocols for the use of human subjects from SAIC's

409
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,160
cognitive science laboratory, and a comprehensive research plan for anomalous mental phenomena

410
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:27,360
from SAIC to the Defense Intelligence Agency, both written in 1991. We also have a 1995 paper titled

411
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,280
Evaluation of a Program on Anomalous Mental Phenomena, which states SAIC evaluated the

412
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,040
research of SRI International and the Stargate program to continue research internally. Here

413
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,280
we see another paper titled An Assessment of the Evidence for Psychic Funding. We can see SAIC

414
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,840
even coined their own terms for psionics. Anomalous cognition describing extrasensory perception,

415
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:58,960
aka a sixth sense. An anomalous perturbation describing psychokinesis. While these terms

416
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,280
may seem extraordinary, we can find a now-deleted 2012 Office of Naval Research paper on a human

417
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:12,480
sixth sense, aka extrasensory perception. So while this territory of psionics and researching human

418
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,920
cognition is uncomfortable territory for me, according to RA, the Naval Surface Weapon Center

419
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,440
holds off-world technology handled by private contractors, and the technology somehow interacts

420
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:30,160
with conscious beings. While SAIC and the Navy have approvable interest in this field of psionics

421
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,680
and human cognition potential. And guys, this is all just mention of SAIC's connection to

422
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,920
crane and anomalous human cognition research. There is so much more to discuss with UAP and SAIC,

423
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,560
it probably warrants its own video. Like how Commander Will Miller, one of the key players in

424
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,600
the Wilson Davis memo, labeled SAIC as one of the prominent contractors who are quote-unquote

425
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:58,560
keepers of the secrets in regards to UAP programs. Or the Stephen Greer 1996 briefing to Congress,

426
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:05,040
which labeled SAIC as a quote-unquote crown jewel relating to UAP projects and facilities.

427
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,240
Or lastly, SAIC's inclusion in Catherine Austin Fitz's paper stating quote,

428
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,720
large proportion of the nation's wealth is being illegally diverted into secret

429
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,920
unaccountable channels, end quote. To support Black budget military research and development,

430
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,120
I spoke about this paper in the Wilson Davis video, but SAIC and Lockheed were two of the

431
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:31,280
IBM contractors labeled as responsible for obfuscating data on siphoned DoD funds,

432
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,640
leading to a failed DoD general accounting office audit.

433
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,120
A simple Google Duck Duck Go or any browser of your choosing search will yield zero results for

434
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,160
the off-world technologies division. I have personally scoured thousands of documents trying

435
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,920
to find any mention of this program named by RA to be nestled within Crane. And well guys,

436
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,920
we do have one lead worth chasing. In his book Magic Eyes Only, which is one of the greatest

437
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,280
books ever written on crash retrievals, author Ryan S. Wood discusses the legitimacy of the

438
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:15,200
MJ-12SOM-01 or Special Operations Manual. This leak document covers from A to Z, quote,

439
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,520
extraterrestrial entities and technology recovery and disposal, end quote. For contextual relevance,

440
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,200
Wood mentions a document that appeared in the MJ-12 leaks, allegedly sent by President Franklin

441
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:34,080
D. Roosevelt. This memorandum titled The Special Committee on Non-Terrestrial Science and Technology

442
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:39,760
discusses the application of quote unquote, non-terrestrial technology and the continuation

443
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,360
of the quote already hardened research for advanced weapons program, end quote. This title

444
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,640
and effort sounds extremely similar to the off-world technologies division description,

445
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:57,200
but the connection here goes deeper. In this memo, Dr. Vannevar Bush is named. If you haven't,

446
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,720
I highly recommend checking out my video on Robert Sarbacher and the early days of the U.S. UFO

447
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,160
crash retrieval and technology exploitation programs. Physicist and member of the Scientific

448
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,520
Research and Development Board, Robert Sarbacher, was outspoken regarding the involvement of Dr.

449
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,280
Vannevar Bush and covert UFO programs. During an interview with legendary UFO researcher,

450
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:26,240
Stanton Friedman, Sarbacher name dropped one Dr. Eric A. Walker as a crash retrieval member.

451
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,000
Viewers of this video will remember a series of interviews with Dr. Eric A. Walker. Walker dodged

452
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,120
many questions when asked about things like the MJ-12. He outright confirmed he was present

453
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:44,000
to the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania crash, and he also said a few sentences that are often overlooked

454
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,800
but incredibly strange in the context of the off-world technologies division and consciousness

455
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,440
related technology. This technology RA observed required a conscious observer to perform, activate,

456
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,680
or whatever it does. When asked about people within the UFO issue, Dr. Walker discusses how

457
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,160
few people are capable of handling this issue. He states, quote, how good is your sixth sense?

458
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,320
How much do you know about ESP? Unless you know about it and how to use it, you would not be

459
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:26,000
taken in. Only a few know about it, end quote. Another DOD slash DOE contractor involved with

460
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,120
NSWC Crane I want to briefly explore here is Sandia National Labs. If you remember from my 1950s

461
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:39,360
Dell Rio crash retrieval video, UAP crash material were allegedly stored in the Atomic Energy Commission

462
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:46,080
Sandia Labs facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. In that video, I drew the connection to AT&T,

463
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:52,400
manager of Sandia at the time, being implicated in UAP technology transfer. SAIC has massive

464
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,440
contracts itself with Sandia National Labs, such as this 2013 five-year 228 million dollar

465
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:06,800
IT consolidation contract. But what really interests me here is this 2023 technology transfer between

466
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,680
NSWC Crane, Sandia Labs, and other participants for advanced hypersonic technology. Of course,

467
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,200
hypersonics have existed since the 1970s with Soviet vehicles, and there are sources connected

468
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,560
to the IC that tell me Sandia's stealth plasma physics regarding hypersonic craft is of real

469
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,760
interest here. However, I do think this is worth mentioning because of some interesting context.

470
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,600
In 2023, attorney Daniel Sheehan implicated the defense contractor Radiance Technologies being

471
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,520
involved with UAP reverse engineering. Sheehan claimed Radiance's prompt global strike program

472
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,480
leveraged reverse engineered UAP technologies for their hypersonic missile development program.

473
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,120
Probably not much of a connection here, but after Sheehan's claims, it is interesting to see

474
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:58,080
both SAIC and Sandia National Labs connected to each other and NSWC with the hypersonics program.

475
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:08,720
The connection between the U.S. Navy, SAIC, and UAP programs go even deeper. Meet NASA

476
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,840
mission specialist Bob Ulsler, a now deceased engineer who explored robotic sciences and

477
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:20,160
created remote controlled machines for the U.S. space agency. Ulsler had a keen interest in UFOs.

478
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,680
In 1989, Ulsler met with Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, whose incredible credentials include

479
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,600
former NSA director and director of naval intelligence. Inman told Ulsler about quote

480
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:39,440
unquote recovered vehicles available for research. Do you anticipate that any of the

481
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:48,480
recovered vehicles would ever become available for technological research outside of the

482
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,400
military circles? Again, I honestly don't know. Ten years ago, the answer would have been no.

483
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:00,640
Whether a time has evolved or they're beginning to become open on it is a possibility.

484
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,080
Inman even referred Ulsler to speak with Everett Heineman of the CIA, DS&T, and former director

485
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:13,200
of naval intelligence Sumner Shapiro for more information on UAP recoveries. In 1992, Inman

486
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:20,320
would leave the federal service and join the board of SAIC. According to Ulsler, an alien contact

487
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,600
by Timothy Good, Ulsler met retired rear Admiral Shapiro under the guys he was interested in working

488
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:31,360
within the group that manages UAP information. Shapiro stated to Ulsler that the U.S. possesses

489
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:37,040
extra terrestrial vehicles and that Shapiro had even studied one up close. According to Shapiro,

490
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,400
teams would disassemble the craft, pack up the parts and ship them to labs across the continental

491
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,480
United States. Did NSWC Crane receive some sort of craft component? Navy suits thought to be

492
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,160
utilized as a weapon system? If you want to learn more about Ulsler, see the video description for

493
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,360
a series of interviews. I may cover him further in the future as Ulsler has much more to say

494
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:05,040
about UAP, including the possibility the Navy utilizes EMP weaponry to interfere with craft

495
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,240
flight systems. So perhaps there's some really interesting further research to be done on the U.S.

496
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,120
Navy in particular, testing and receiving parts of downed or crashed UAP.

497
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:26,800
And to touch on briefly, back in 2017 at Navy Air Station Pax River, American aerospace engineer

498
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,560
and inventor with a PhD in mechanical and aerospace engineering, Salvador Pais,

499
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,320
filed a patent for a triangle slash diamond shaped craft that exhibits anti-gravitic effects and

500
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:44,880
strongly resembles a TR-3B, a ledge reverse engineered triangle craft. The patent was supported

501
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,920
by Naval Air Enterprise CTO, James Sheehy, and then approved. This craft design described by Pais is

502
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,600
able to create and manipulate fields and quantum vacuum around the craft, leading to craft propulsion.

503
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,400
I'd leave this to smarter physics people than I, but I would really recommend watching Salvatore

504
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,920
Pais's episode on Kurt Gimungals, The Theory of Everything. And in his book, In Plain Sight,

505
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,880
Ross Colthart relays a conversation with former U.S. Navy director of science and technology

506
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,800
development, Nat Corbett's. Corbett state he made a few quote unquote discrete inquiries

507
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,000
into Pais's craft patent and Nav Air Pax River. None of his Navy colleagues had any

508
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,360
information on Pais or his patents. Corbett stated quote, if there is anything near a

509
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:35,600
working anti-gravity craft, they've kept it very quiet end quote. Pax River is a very important

510
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:41,280
message here. Located in Virginia, Nav Air Pax River is almost a counterpart to Nav Sea Crane.

511
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:48,000
Pax River also has a storied history of contracts with SAIC. Pais, his patents exotic propulsion,

512
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,480
Nav Air and Pax River were worth briefly mentioning to me just due to the strangeness of NSWC Crane's

513
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,560
Nav Sea's sister facility Pax River. Perhaps similar programs of NHI technology reverse

514
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:07,120
engineering efforts are conducted at this facility as well. What's up guys it's Gerb,

515
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:13,280
I hope you enjoyed this look into RA and the off-world technologies division nestled within

516
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:20,480
NSWC Crane, Indiana. This project has been exceptional for me to work on. I've got to talk

517
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:27,360
to some incredible people like RA. I need to shout out again Kermit for all the SAIC research

518
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,960
and just the amount of research that stemmed from this small testimony. I mean let's think

519
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:40,160
about this. RA stated that he was at an SWC. He was taken deep underground by a contractor.

520
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:46,240
I'm willing to bet my best bucket it's an SAIC person shown an off-world technologies

521
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,080
division with two pieces of technology on display that interact with human consciousness.

522
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,560
This begs the question are these the only two pieces of technology that this off-world technology

523
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:05,200
has or are there multiple and these really are what kind of RA was thinking about just put on

524
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:12,480
display. Right now I'm working with RA to actually get some drawings and possible 3D models of what

525
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,360
he saw. I think that would really help everybody kind of visualize what he's seen and so forth.

526
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:23,600
I was stunned at the amount of available research just from hearing about these two objects especially

527
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:30,720
the symbology that RA saw and how it connected to she hand symbols. When he stated in 2021 he saw

528
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:38,640
these on an image of a downed craft. Just truly truly fantastic stuff. I forgot to mention in the

529
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:46,560
video just because there's so much I couldn't fit everything in. In I think late July of 2023

530
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:54,560
RA contacted Stephen Greer and the disclosure project to tell this story. He emailed them about

531
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:01,040
his story and they never got back to him. So that was weird but if you want to read about his

532
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,400
files in there I think he's witness number 10127. But I really hope you guys enjoyed this. Let me

533
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:14,640
know what you think with the off-world technologies division and its connections to you know possibly

534
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:22,080
that FDR MJ12 memo from 44. There is an offshoot of parallel research here and this is just incredible

535
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:28,560
that this ties into the MJ12 and everything too. So I really hope you guys enjoyed this video. I'm

536
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,760
sorry it took me so long. This has just been a lot of investigation a lot of research as we can see

537
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,960
that this off-world technologies division has research from everywhere from NSWC Crane in their

538
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:46,320
contracts with SAIC all the way to Salvatore, Pais and Pax River. So if you guys wouldn't mind

539
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,160
drop a like, drop a subscription and share this video around if you can. You know I can't get the

540
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,760
same sort of video output as some of the other creators in this space. I got a lot more research

541
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,280
and stuff to put into my video. So if you could share it around I'd appreciate it and let me know

542
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,800
below what you guys think of RA and his story. Let me know if you have come across any other stories

543
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,120
that may fit into this investigation. Help me investigate further. If you know or if you've

544
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:16,720
heard of the off-world technologies division please tell me because I would love to have any sort of

545
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,000
documents or research I can. There is one really interesting tie-in I've been thinking of lately.

546
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,800
Does anybody remember when Jason Sands came public on Twitter? You remember the whistleblower that

547
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,440
came before him his name was Steve who actually introduced Sands didn't say him by name but kind

548
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,800
of set his story and this is what had Sands come forward on Twitter. Well do you remember the other

549
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,360
guy who came forward I think on Courtney I can't remember her last name's page his name was Martin

550
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:48,080
he claimed to be in like a kind of remote viewing programs growing up. Well I listened to his testimony

551
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:55,040
and one of his claims was that when he was a part of these programs there was a time where I think

552
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:02,160
there was eight scientists brought a briefcase into a room and opened it and in this briefcase

553
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:09,200
was a sphere the size of a basketball very clear looking that Martin was told chose who it interacted

554
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:16,240
with I think he said so I've actually connected with Martin I'm talking to him now I'm really keen

555
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,280
to get to the bottom of his story too and see if there's any sort of connections I can make there

556
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,680
because this is just really perplexing as I said in the video just kind of the stuff with

557
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,480
consciousness SAI's research into remote viewing and stuff this is really weird territory for me

558
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,680
I'm a real nuts and bolts type guy when it comes to UAP I like the fact so whenever there's any

559
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,320
sort of distortion of human cognition like in the whistleblower like in the infographics whistleblower

560
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:47,360
video or technology that interacts with human consciousness or like p3 assets like Mike Herrera

561
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,720
talks about it's all very new territory for me so you know it's strange expeditions for me I'm sure

562
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:59,520
it is for you too sometimes just because growing up I am just the UFO guy I like the craft I like

563
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,520
the crash retrieval I like the reverse engineering but the more you study this phenomenon I think

564
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:09,360
the guys on mysterious universe said it the stranger it gets a lot of a lot of high strangeness

565
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:14,480
and weirdness gets here so again guys remember to leave a like and thank you so much I will

566
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,600
catch you all in the next show
