Due to his TS/SCI clearance, the weapons instructor, a private contractor employee, took RA and another soldier deep underground to this anomalous division.\n\nThe division housed two pieces of technology not made by human hand - a sphere, roughly the size of a basketball, with an indentation on top, as well as a clear tablet-looking device apparently projecting some sort of symbology. RA was told these devices were considered weapons due to energetic output when recovered from a craft. Both technologies were said to interact with human consciousness.\n\nJoin this first-hand investigation to discover the secrets of the Off-World Technologies Division, the connections to SAIC and Sandia Labs, and more!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: ALL RESEARCH LINKS ARE ATTACHED IN GOOGLE DOC BELOW.
