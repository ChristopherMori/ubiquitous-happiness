0	4000	So let's start from the very beginning.
4000	8000	You say it's a 90 year cover-up.
8000	9000	Just about, yeah.
9000	10000	90 years?
10000	15000	1933 was the first recovery in Europe, in Magenta, Italy.
15000	19000	They recovered a partially intact vehicle.
19000	20000	It's true, it's real.
20000	22000	Yeah, that actually happened.
22000	29000	Italian government moved it to a secure air base in Italy for the rest of kind of the fascist regime
29000	34000	until 1944-1945, and the Pope Pius XII back-channeled that.
34000	35000	So the Vatican was involved.
35000	40000	Yeah, and told the Americans what the Italians had, and we ended up scooping it.
40000	41000	So let me be very clear about this.
41000	49000	You're saying that the Catholic Church, the Vatican, they know about the existence of non-human intelligence on this planet.
49000	50000	Certainly.
50000	53000	It didn't start or end with Roswell.
53000	60000	The first traceable recovery of a UFO occurred 14 years before the infamous cover-up in the desert sands of Nevada.
60000	69000	In fact, in direct statements made by both David Grush and Lui Elizondo, the first NHI craft to be forcibly taken by U.S. forces
69000	73000	would arise from the smoldering remains of the Italian fascist state,
73000	77000	led by none other than bonito Mussolini during the Second World War.
77000	86000	Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb, and today we are going to discuss the now infamous 1933 Magenta, Italy UFO crash retrieval.
86000	91000	This tale is both intriguing and perplexing, featuring a rich document trail
91000	96000	and fascinating historical connections to the regime of Mussolini and the Vatican.
96000	101000	Why did Grush specifically reference this case to Ross Colthart in his News Nation article?
101000	108000	Buckle up guys, because today we are going to dive right into the Magenta UFO retrieval.
111000	119000	Before we do any sort of investigation, let's discuss the story, and guys, please forgive any butchering of Italian words or names that I use.
119000	129000	In June of 1933, 14 years before the Roswell crash, an unknown craft crashed or landed at Magenta, just west of Milan, Italy.
129000	139000	The craft was reported to be bell-like, almost resembling a mix between a flying saucer and the Glock, the legendary mythical alleged Nazi wonder weapon.
139000	143000	The craft sat at a reported 10 meters in diameter.
143000	151000	Dictator bonito Mussolini thought this was an unconventional flying vehicle that originated from France, Britain, or Germany,
151000	159000	but the Italian government established a top-secret group, the Gaminetto Ricciare specialise 33,
159000	166000	or how I'll refer to it from now on so you don't make me say that again, the RS33 to examine the craft.
166000	171000	This top-secret group was actually headed by Prime Minister Benito Mussolini,
171000	176000	and Foreign Minister Gallezo Siano, Air Marshal Italo Balbo,
176000	184000	with scientific support from astronomer Gino Saccini and possibly senator and founder of the radio, Guglielmo Marconi.
184000	191000	Marconi himself initially resisted Mussolini's terrestrial claims, believing the craft to be extraterrestrial in origin.
191000	200000	The craft and its debris was reportedly stored in the hangars of the SIAI Marchetti Aircraft Company in Virgiate Varese.
200000	209000	Journalists were ordered to keep silent about the incident due to national security, citing strict dissemination of information by the Agenzi Stefani,
209000	212000	Italy's state propaganda papers.
212000	217000	The UFO remained in the possession of Mussolini's regime until the fall of the Axis powers
217000	226000	and was recovered by US agents of the Office of Strategic Services in 1944 or 1945, and this was the former US intelligence agency.
226000	238000	The magenta case was brought to light by Italian UFO researcher Roberto Pinotti, who in 1996 received original Italian secret documents from the fascist regime,
238000	247000	containing both protocol on how to handle the craft discovery, as well as internal Italian government notes on UFO sightings from 1933 to 1940.
247000	251000	The document consisted of both telegrams and handwritten notes.
251000	265000	The sender chose to remain anonymous to Pinotti, going only by Mr. X, the did claim to have inherited them from a family member who worked on Mussolini's supposed UFO program.
265000	273000	Roberto received a series of three internal Italian government telegrams relating to the craft. Let's review each one.
273000	284000	In our first telegram, we see the telegram is sent by the director of special affairs of the Stefani news agency, the only agency of the Mussolini regime, as an official telegram of Milan.
284000	292000	The priority of the telegram is labeled lampo, or highest, with a reservatissimo, a confidential rating.
292000	302000	The telegram reads, quote, by order of the duce, the leader, absolute silence is ordered of the presumed landing of an unknown aircraft on national soil.
302000	309000	The version is to be published with today's dispatch is confirmed. The same version also applies to personnel and journalists.
309000	318000	Maximum penalties for offenders up to and including appeal to the state security court. Please confirm receipt immediately.
318000	329000	Our second telegram was set on the 13th of June 1933 at 4 p.m. again from the Stefani news agency, with lampo priority and reservatissimo classification.
329000	340000	This document reads, quote, by superior order, the news disclosed today in the Stefani dispatch number 63 slash 3 slash 1 dot 0 should be treated as follows.
340000	347000	The above mentioned aircraft has been recognized as a meteor by the Barrera Astronomical Observatory.
347000	352000	Given the news, the slightest graphic relevance, there is no need to rectify, minimize.
352000	362000	And finally, our third telegram was sent the same day, the 13th of June 1933 with the same priority classification and sender this time at 507 p.m.
362000	374000	This telegram reads, quote, by order of the leader, it is ordered that circulation of the news about the craft of unknown nature referred to in today's Stefani dispatch at 7 30 a.m. be stopped immediately.
374000	379000	It is ordered that any leads for newspapers carrying this news be recast immediately.
379000	386000	Maximum penalties for offenders up to and including appeal to the state security court, please confirm receipt immediately.
386000	394000	So with these three telegrams, we see the Italian press demand absolute silence over a landing of an unknown craft.
394000	400000	Immediate arrest and maximum penalties were to be issued to any journalist commenting on the craft.
400000	408000	From the telegrams, we can see the Italian propaganda initially pushed for journalists to treat the landing of the craft as an identified meteor.
408000	416000	Only to swiftly cease any and all reporting by Italian journalists. Does this not sound awfully similar to the Roswell incident?
416000	425000	Quick media control to drown out the presence of a crashed UFO?
425000	432000	If you look at the second and third telegrams I've shown you, you will notice an r slash s stamp in the telegram text field.
432000	438000	Unfortunately, I can't find any sharp enough images to decipher what exactly the text on this field reads.
438000	442000	However, remember in the description of the alleged magenta craft?
442000	452000	A top secret scientific coalition was formed to investigate the craft named the gabinetto richerce speciale 33 or the RS 33.
452000	456000	In other words, the special group of 1933.
456000	466000	Well, within the document sent to Pinotti, we see an introduction directly mentioning the RS 33 as a prelude to two sheets describing protocol for the crash.
466000	471000	Atop the letter in two pages lies the stamp of the Kingdom Senate.
471000	477000	This intro to this protocol memorandum has been translated by Paulo Guisardi and reads, quote,
477000	483000	Dear DeSanti, I am sending you as requested and agreed verbally the note for your rule.
483000	486000	Do not make copies. Do not even mention it to your deputy.
486000	491000	For any matter having to do with the RS 33 office, come to me first.
491000	498000	I personally wrote these lines as to not expose them to the eyes of my secretaries, therefore adjust accordingly.
498000	505000	So who is this DeSanti and who are the figures I mentioned earlier as connected with the RS 33?
505000	513000	DeSanti, the man to which the craft recovery protocol was addressed, was almost assuredly a pseudonym for one Tommaso David,
513000	520000	a colonel of the Frossinone founder of the Volpi Argentante spy group and later head of the Salo Secret Service,
520000	524000	as discovered by Italian historian Arrigo Petaccio.
524000	532000	Earlier, I mentioned the possible connection of Guglielmo Marconi to the RS 33, the Nobel Prize winning inventor of the radio.
532000	539000	Marconi was an outspoken advocate for belief in extraterrestrials, pursuing the possibility of contacting them via radio,
539000	549000	as outlined in a rare article published in 1937 titled, Guglielmo Marconi, Magician of the Invisible Ruler of Spaces by La Stella Mario,
549000	554000	which itself referenced earlier claims by Marconi in 1920 and 1932.
554000	563000	At this time in 1933, the strict propaganda machine of the Stefani as mentioned earlier would cover everything under the regime bar the highest authorities,
563000	568000	Benito Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, and Air Marshal Balbo.
568000	575000	Due to this, it stands to reason the two men besides the Duce would be read into the top secret RS 33.
575000	583000	Ciano's likely involvement in RS 33 and direct naming in the fascist UFO sightings post-magenta will become apparent later in the video.
583000	592000	It is worth mentioning the famous Ciano diaries that describe Ciano's experience and involvement within fascist Italy up to his execution in 1943,
592000	599000	makes no mention of this secret group. However, it is understandable given the top secrecy of this commission.
599000	608000	What is interesting, however, is a deep rabbit hole between Eta Ciano, Ciano's wife and Mussolini's daughter, Alan W. Doles,
608000	616000	the Ciano diaries and Operation Sunrise. As a front to retrieve the magenta UFO from the crumbling fascist state,
616000	622000	this is not my research, so I will not pass it off as my own. However, if you guys are interested,
622000	633000	I will see if I can do an interview with the really sharp cat who has spent countless hours digging into the craft retrieval process by the United States.
634000	640000	Now onto the mentioned memorandum describing craft recovery to DeSanti in conjunction with the RS 33.
640000	648000	We see these labeled personal note, very confidential, so let's go through all nine steps of protocol surrounding the magenta retrieval.
648000	654000	One, notify the mayor. Two, order the immediate recovery of the aircraft.
654000	666000	Three, order immediate arrest of all witnesses. Appoint Special Section RS 33 of the OVRA, the Italian Gestapo, present in each provincial capital.
666000	677000	Four, direct all reports with the utmost secrecy and precedence over all priorities to the Central Meteorological Office at La Sapienza University in Rome,
677000	686000	exclusive relevance RS 33 office. Five, to prevent ex-officio the dissemination of any news particularly in the press.
686000	697000	Six, for the purpose of the previous point, it is necessary to publish from time to time very short articles in which the phenomenon is reported to its authentic and unique celestial nature.
697000	712000	Meteor, shooting star, planet, luminous halo, iris, etc., according to form RS 33.fz.4 previously transmitted to all the prefectures of the kingdom by special dispatch.
712000	725000	Seven, transmission of reports to the Air Force is subject to the prior favorable opinion of the RS 33 office, whose decisions are unappealable up to the highest hierarchy of the duce.
725000	736000	Eight, strict exclusion of any other scientific body from the collection and examination of the reports available, including the Pontifical University.
736000	752000	And nine, charge all expenses related to this provision to CAP 32 title XXII heading 32-2 of the order to the R-Academia di Italia, written authorization from Chief of Staff RS 33.
752000	773000	And a couple thoughts here guys, points eight and nine sound like protocol almost identical to USAF regulation 200-2 from 1953, which I talk about all the time in which UFO sightings were delegated strictly to the Air Force or higher authorities while restricting cases to be shared with scientific bodies of Project Blue Book.
773000	789000	And all of this operating protocol sounds extremely similar to the alleged MJ 12 or Majestic 12. If you don't know what that is, it is basically the alleged crash retrieval and reverse engineering group that operates with complete autonomy to investigate NHI within the USG.
789000	802000	This is a really rough summary as maybe I need to cover the MJ 12 docs, but the RS 33 sounds like an Italian precursor to the US body that would arise in the late 40s slash early 50s.
804000	811000	So, unlike the Stefani telegrams and memorandums, I have no verifiable evidence here for craft storage.
811000	820000	But according to the anonymous sender Mr. X, the remains of the craft were stored in the shed of the SIA Marchetti Aeronautical Manufacturing Company.
820000	830000	The trail here is incredibly confusing, as sometime during the 1943 year, it is proposed the Nazis took control of the UFO and dissolved the RS 33.
830000	838000	A possible link here is that a fire occurred in the SIA warehouse in Virgiat on the 17th of March 1943.
838000	846000	The craft likely was then moved to Mussolini's enormous bunker under Mount Serrate, 27 miles north of Rome.
846000	854000	At the time of its construction in 1937, the bunker was the largest in Europe, three miles long and 300 feet underground.
855000	861000	Rumors circulated the bunker was used to house military equipment, possibly a recovered NHI craft.
861000	872000	On the 8th of September 1943, the Germans executed Operation Auxay, disarming all Italian units and commandeering the bunker for the Wehrmacht command for southern Europe.
872000	878000	More research needs to be done here to try to find a hard paper trail for the craft, but this is what we're working with for now.
879000	886000	An additional piece to this already complex puzzle was included by Mr. X to Pinotti.
886000	895000	These included a series of handwritten notes additionally bearing the seal of the Kingdom Senate, describing a UFO encounter titled Mestre.
895000	900000	With these is a 1936 Stefani telegram about Mestre stating quote,
900000	909000	Absolute secrecy is required about unidentified aircraft mentioned in the 23-47 Confidential Report. A letter will follow.
909000	911000	Okay, and on to our letter.
911000	919000	We see a curious drawing of a cigar shaped UFO with what appears to be an exhaust tail, not too dissimilar to a rocket engine,
919000	923000	followed by two saucers with domes like ping pong balls on top.
923000	932000	I'm immediately reminded of the flying saucer as described by Lieutenant Jacobs and the 1948 Chili's Witted Encounter.
932000	940000	In this UFO encounter, two American commercial pilots reported their aircraft nearly collided with the UFO over Montgomery, Alabama.
940000	944000	The UFO quote looked like a wingless aircraft.
944000	951000	It seemed to have two rows of windows through which glowed a very bright light, as brilliant as a magnesium flare,
951000	955000	comically guys Blue Book described this case as a meteor.
955000	961000	Anywho, the text on this scribbled handwritten note was thankfully transcribed by the black vault.
961000	963000	This reads quote,
963000	965000	It was observed in the morning.
965000	971000	It was a metallic disc polished and reflecting light with a length of 10 or 12 meters.
971000	979000	Two fighter aircraft from a nearby Air Force Base took off, but were not able to reach it even traveling at 130 kilometers per hour.
979000	985000	It did not admit any sound, which would lead one to consider an aerostat, a balloon,
985000	989000	but nobody knows of balloons that can fly faster than the wind.
989000	992000	I know for sure that it was seen by other pilots.
992000	995000	The report arrived in the hands of Allegible.
995000	999000	Then, after approximately an hour and a half of flying over Mestre,
999000	1004000	it was seen as a sort of metallic tube, gray or slate in color.
1004000	1011000	A drawing by a confidential informant was redrawn by Andre, who, as far as the two A and B drawings are concerned,
1011000	1021000	explained that A was described as being like a kind of aerial torpedo with very clear windows and with alternating white and red lights.
1021000	1026000	B were two hats, two hats like those used by priests.
1026000	1033000	They were wide, round with a dome in the center, metallic and followed the torpedo without changing their relative positions.
1033000	1042000	The prefecture has opened an inquiry, but you can imagine that it will make little inroads and have a similar outcome to that of the 1931 case.
1042000	1051000	The Duce has expressed his worries, because he says that if it were an English or French aircraft, his foreign policy would have to start all over again.
1051000	1056000	And Italy wasn't just monitoring its own skies at this time.
1056000	1067000	Here we can see from the archives of the prefecture in Milan, copies of telegrams from the prefects of the Kingdom of Italy to the government between 1933 and 1938,
1067000	1075000	mentioning reports of, quote, unconventional flying vehicles, and show the official attention of the Italian authorities to the problem.
1075000	1085000	This telegram, signed by prefect Mutinelli, mentions the presence of unknown flying vehicles over Valona in Albania, a country under Italian control.
1087000	1093000	Of course, every single thing I talked about would be void if the documents were fake, right?
1093000	1098000	Well, fortunately, Pinotti took a skeptical approach when he was first contacted by Mr. X.
1098000	1105000	He had the documents tested by a forensic expert who said the paper and ink was from the period of the 1930s.
1105000	1112000	Additionally, scientific consultant Antonio Garavaglia shared with Daily Mail, quote,
1112000	1120000	it can be stated with reasonable certainty that this sample examined in the subject of the appraisal can be considered original and therefore authentic.
1120000	1128000	Additionally, Italian Reddit user Lowlab5185 was able to lend his hand to the legitimacy of these documents,
1128000	1137000	by not only commenting on the writing style matching the futurism era of fascist communication style but also provided two examples
1137000	1143000	of official telegram templates used by Italian authorities in the 1930s. See the resemblance here.
1146000	1154000	Remember how in both the telegrams and the RS-33 protocol mentioned was made of labeling the craft's landing a meteor
1154000	1159000	or other meteorological phenomena as directed by the Agenzia Stefani?
1159000	1164000	Well, check this out. We can actually find direct reporting of this disinformation.
1164000	1170000	From our telegrams and testimony, we can conclude the crash or landing occurred on the 13th of June 1933.
1170000	1177000	From later that same month, we can find newspapers and magazines that report on inclement weather occurring in the Magenta area,
1177000	1181000	severe lightning storms and hail storms that illuminated the night sky,
1181000	1188000	such as this paper from the 22nd of June, which reported the week prior a lightning strike that illuminated the night sky
1188000	1195000	and struck five bricklayers on the Tricetta Magenta Road, now on screen as a magazine illustration depicting the event.
1198000	1205000	I unfortunately don't have much to go on for the Magenta case connection to the Vatican and Pope Pius XII.
1205000	1212000	We will have to go off the word of David Grush and reporting done by Christopher Sharp predating Grush in his 2021 article
1212000	1215000	All UFO disclosure roads lead to Rome.
1215000	1223000	Sharp writes about how initial relationships between Mussolini and the Catholic priesthood were quite good
1223000	1229000	and how the Duce confided with Pope Pius XII about the retrieved unknown craft.
1229000	1236000	The Pope allegedly became uneasy about the craft being in an Italian possession, as Italy allied with the Nazis,
1236000	1239000	thus leaking information to the US about the craft.
1239000	1244000	Due to the Pope's information, the facility which housed the craft was spared from Allied bombing.
1244000	1249000	This curiously does in fact line up with the bunker serrate we spoke about earlier.
1249000	1254000	After the war or the end of 1944, the craft was brought to the US.
1254000	1258000	Of course, this is all based on reporting and I do not have a paper trail,
1258000	1262000	but Christopher Sharp is a well-respected journalist within the UAP realm.
1262000	1268000	As we stand, we can prove the authenticity of the documents but not yet these anecdotal accounts.
1270000	1277000	And lastly, my friends, as we opened with a powerful statement by David Grush,
1277000	1281000	I would like to leave you with an additionally powerful statement by Lou Elizondo.
1281000	1290000	Kind of gave a few hints before, but Roswell may not have been the first event and well known.
1290000	1298000	I mean, there's been some reporting internationally as well that there have been some crashed vehicles
1298000	1305000	and they were obtained by local authorities and there was some scientific study done on them.
1305000	1309000	I want to be very careful not to go too far down the rabbit hole,
1309000	1315000	but I've seen personally some documentation that's very compelling from a particular foreign country
1315000	1325000	where they had a recovery of a vehicle and they had some countries conducting scientific analysis on it.
1325000	1334000	And after World War II, allegedly, parts of that vehicle were brought to the United States.
1334000	1337000	Yeah, I think I know what country that was.
1337000	1340000	It was in the South American country, I think.
1340000	1344000	Maybe Brazil, you know.
1344000	1349000	Damn it, Argentina? I'm not sure.
1349000	1354000	Well, it was Italy.
1354000	1360000	Yeah, that's as it was explained to me, I saw some documentation.
1360000	1365000	Look, you know, I don't want to get too much into, you know, conspiracy side of the house.
1365000	1368000	There is some documentation that has been validated.
1368000	1373000	That was that was from Mussolini himself.
1373000	1377000	And it's, you know, it's authentic.
1377000	1381000	It's been proven to be authentic the documentation.
1382000	1385000	So certainly interesting.
1385000	1392000	Hey, guys, thank you so much for joining me today as we took this dive into the 1933 Magenta, Italy case.
1392000	1394000	Sorry for the little bit of time away.
1394000	1398000	I had some family in town for their spring break, but now that that's done, we're back in action.
1398000	1400000	Personally, I find this case scintillating.
1400000	1402000	It's the Roswell before Roswell.
1402000	1406000	There's a rich paper trail here as shown by Pinotti.
1406000	1410000	So this is the kind of case I love where we have documents we can dive into.
1410000	1411000	We can cross reference.
1411000	1414000	We can see what's going on with legitimate documentation.
1414000	1420000	So I remember when Grush first went public with his News Nation interview and he referenced this case.
1420000	1424000	I was gobsmacked, as Ross Colthart would like to say.
1424000	1429000	And immediately I dove into learning more and as much as I could about the Magenta case.
1429000	1435000	I find this case particularly compelling, especially the idea that Benito Mussolini,
1435000	1442000	who wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, thought this was a craft of British or German or French origin.
1442000	1450000	And I find the description of the clock particularly interesting, this kind of bell shaped saucer type UFO.
1450000	1457000	I know there were some details added later on by one, I think William Brophy or William Brophy's grandson,
1457000	1461000	who claimed that there were bodies uncovered, as we can see in the original documentation.
1461000	1467000	We find no evidence of bodies, so of course I don't want to include those when I don't have any sort of hard evidence.
1467000	1469000	I'm not sure about his claims.
1469000	1476000	I think this man was involved in some other hoaxes, but I purposefully did not include that in today's video.
1476000	1481000	And if you guys are interested, I will talk to the gentleman who has done countless hours of work
1481000	1486000	into finding the connection process as to how the US retrieved the craft.
1486000	1492000	I did not cover this because I could not talk about this without basically copying his work.
1492000	1499000	That would undermine my credibility and undermine the dozens, if not hundreds of hours he has put into pouring through documents.
1499000	1504000	So that's just not how I roll, I respect the man completely, but I would love to cover that if I can get him on the show.
1504000	1507000	As always guys, please remember to like and subscribe.
1507000	1515000	This has been a particularly active week in UFOs with the Arrow Report and the D.D. Johnson FOIA request.
1515000	1517000	So we have a lot to cover coming up guys.
1517000	1521000	Hope you enjoyed this video and I will catch everybody next time. Thank you.
