    "description": "A look into the Roswell before Roswell that was brought to the world's attention by David Grusch - the 1933 Magenta Italy UFO crash retrieval. This case has a tremendously fascinating story and rich lore dating back to the Fascist Regime of Benito Mussolini.\n\nItalian UFO Researcher Roberto Pinotti came into possession of official fascist internal documents in the late 90s that spelled out the story of the Magenta UAP collection. These documents included telegrams, memorandums, and handwritten notes that tell of the sophisticated disinformation tactics utilized to keep the UFO retrieval secret as well as the establishment of a scientific coalition codenamed the RS/33. This secret group tasked with the scientific study of the crashed OR landed UFO is strangely reminiscent of the alleged MJ12 documents that would appear decades later. \n\nIn addition to the Telegrams and memorandums highlighting the RS/33 involvement with the case, handwritten notes and official documents are included on Italian UFO sightings between 1933 and 1940; specifically a case of a cigar-shaped UAP followed by two flying saucers. Interestingly, these notes address Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law and suspected member of the RS/33.\n\nThe conspiracy here deepens with allegations Pope Pius XXII informed the US of the craft's existence as well as the hiding of the craft within Mussolini's famous bunker under Mount Soratte.\n\nThis video seeks to investigate the paper trail of the Magenta, Italy 1933 craft to investigate the full, and true story.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:48 The Story\n4:32 Telegrams\n7:01 RS/33\n10:29 Protocol Memorandum\n13:20 Craft Storage\n14:27 Italian UFO Reports\n19:02 Stefani Disinformation\n19:53 Vatican Connection \n21:07 Lue Elizondo\n23:04 Conclusion\n\nMagenta, the Story: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12252381/Italian-researcher-shares-evidence-files-secret-UFO-crash-Italy.html\n\nBlack Vault Coverage: https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/the-ufo-files-of-mussolini-fascist-ufo-files-by-roberto-pinotti/\n\nReddit Telegram Reuploads: https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15j8k3t/david_grusch_gave_us_a_hint_1933_italy_ufo_crash/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/14desdy/whistleblower_david_grusch_and_the_italian_ufo/\n\nBest Coverage of Magenta (Translate Required): https://www.silverland.info/documenti/gabinetto-rs-33/\n\nNote Transcription: https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15kcwkt/1933_italy_ufo_crash_report_translated/\n\nAgenzia Stefani: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenzia_Stefani\n\nFacist Document Comparisson: \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20230806011212/https://www.icharta.com/media/catalog/product/cache/69a51cc83c75c6910294c3bc195e645e/c/-/c-216721-1.jpg   \n\nLue Elizondo Discussion (1:14:22-1:26:10): - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqtSWD6PYW8  \n\nBunker Soratte: \nhttps://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/mussolinis-massive-bunker-built-wwii.html \nhttps://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunker-soratte \n\nLiberation Times \"All UFO Disclosure Roads Lead to Rome\": https://www.liberationtimes.com/home/disclosure-road-leads-to-rome\n\nGaleazzo Ciano: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galeazzo_Ciano\n\nGuglielmo Marconi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi\n\nOld Italian Forum on RS/33 and Magenta Crash: https://web.archive.org/web/20070819053025/http://www.zonamagica.net/filesfascisti.htm \n\nSunday June 17 1933 Meteor:\nhttp://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,7/articleid,1143_01_1933_0144A_0007_24395130/anews,true/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15efnyu/investigation_into_the_1933_magenta_italy_ufo/\n\nDe Santi: https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=31280627315&cm_sp=snippet-_-srp1-_-tile8&searchurl=an%3DPETACCO%252C%2BARRIGO%26ds%3D10%26sortby%3D17\n\nCiano Dairies: https://archive.org/stream/GibsonHughTheCianoDiaries19391943TheCompleteUnabridgedDiariesOfCountGaleazzoCian/Gibson%2C+Hugh+-+The+Ciano+Diaries+1939-1943+The+Complete%2C+Unabridged+Diaries+of+Count+Galeazzo+Ciano%2C+Italian+Minister+of+Foreign+Affairs%2C+1936-1943_djvu.txt\n\nTomasso David: https://inpartibusinfidelium.wordpress.com/2011/09/02/tommaso-david-da-fascista-a-neofascista/ \n\nPaolo Guizzardi Translations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32UFw_6EiME&t=817s\n\nChiles-Whitted Encounter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiles-Whitted_UFO_encounter \n\nMusic by the always talented: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz71_7z7NphLPZ0l_7G3Llg\n\n#ufo #uap #uapnukes #uapdisclosure #ufology #ufonews #ufosightings #uapsightings #ufofootage #uapfootage #hynek #condoncomittee #Jallenhynek #projectsign #projectgrudge #projectbluebook #bluebook #ufocongress #SOL #solfoundation #karlnell #Battelle #UFOreverseengineering #lockheed #skunkworks #lockheedmartin #rosscoulthart #fastwalker #blackvault #slowwalker #kingman #ufocrash #nickredfern #Grusch #Magenta",
