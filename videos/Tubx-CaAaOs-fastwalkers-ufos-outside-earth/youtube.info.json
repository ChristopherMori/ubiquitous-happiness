    "description": "Today let's take a look at the term known as Fastwalkers, a designation for UFOs detected entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere. The terms Fastwalker and Slowwalker have conveniently been utilized by USNORTHCOM and NORAD to avoid any sort of declassification through FOIA requests or other means by Executive Order.\n\nIn this video, we will cover 3 instances in which NORAD, Space Force, and the USG denied access to data on fastwalkers and UFOs in space. The Trail does not end here, however. NORAD's interest in UAP was outed by the infamous J. Allen Hynek in the 60s. Fastwalkers also appear within the 2016 Hillary Clinton email leaks where communications between campaign manager John Podesta and USG Contractor Bob Fish. Fish discusses the Defense Support Program's (DSP) role in monitoring UFO/UAP/Fastwalker. \n\nFollowing down this rabbit hole we can stumble onto 2 shocking cases allegedly involving UAP detection from DSP - one UFO performing impossible maneuvers in space, and another offering confirmation to the 1976 Tehran UFO incident. \n\nThe Rabbit Hole of DSP and Fastwalkers goes deeper with ties to the Aerospace Corporation, one of the companies suggested by Jacques Vallee and Ross Coulthart participating in \"real\" UFO research. \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:59 Terminology \n1:37 Greenwald FOIA Denial\n3:42 1979 NORAD FOIA Denial\n4:47 Orbit Determination of Sunlight Illuminated Objects Detected By Overhead Platforms\n5:53 Defense Support Program \n6:22 Space Based Satellite Tracking and Characterization Utilizing Non-Imaging Passive Sensors\n7:59 Leaked Fastwalker Emails\n10:58 1984 Fastwalker DSP Case\n14:05 1976 Tehran UFO DSP Connection\n19:54 The Aerospace Corporation \n20:24 Conclusion \n\n2023 Black Vault FOIA Denial: https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/space-force-says-documents-on-fastwalkers-and-slowwalkers-all-exempt-from-disclosure/ \n\nFOIA Exemption 1: https://www.justice.gov/archive/oip/foia_guide09/exemption1.pdf\n\nBlack Vault 2013 Fastwalker NORAD Denial: https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/ufos/fastwalkers/FY14-19NOV2013-07.pdf  \n\nOrbit Determination of Sunlight Illuminated Objects Detected By Overhead Platforms: https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/ufos/fastwalkers/a209227.pdf \n\nSpace Based Satellite Tracking and Characterization Utilizing Non-Imaging Passive Sensors: https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/ufos/fastwalkers/ADA478890.pdf \n\nClear intent: the government coverup of the UFO experience: https://archive.org/details/clearintentgover00fawc/mode/2up\n\nPodesta Fish Email: https://web.archive.org/web/20200501044117/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54211 \n\n2014 DSP Fact Sheet: https://web.archive.org/web/20140720060107/http://www.losangeles.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=5323 \n\nRoss Coulthart on Fish: https://www.ufojoe.net/bob-fish/\n\nTOP SECRET SPY SATELLITES SPOT UFOS Mentioned By Fish: https://web.archive.org/web/20180102111818/http://ufodigest.com/shadowmag/extra/topsecret.html\n\nSpace Force X DSP: https://www.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Article/2197774/defense-support-program-satellites/ \n\n1984 Fastwalker: https://web.archive.org/web/20040225055544/http:/www.debshome.com/FastWalker.html\n\nNICAP 1985 Fastwalker Report: https://www.nicap.org/reports/840505orbit_report.htm\n\nCosmic Conspiracy: Part Five, The 80s Six Decades of Government UFO Cover-Ups: https://web.archive.org/web/20030308070428/http:/www.anomalies.net/ufo/gov/dsp/\n\nJoe Stefula: https://www.vlm.cem.va.gov/JOSEPHJOHNSTEFULA/5EEC8\n\nNICAP 1976 Tehran: https://www.nicap.org/760919tehran_dir.htm\n\nDSP Connection Email: https://web.archive.org/web/20060615035006/http:/www.virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/1998/apr/m05-009.shtml\n\nTehran DSP Image: https://web.archive.org/web/19990428103840/http:/ufo-world.simplenet.com/iran_dsp.html\n\nTehran DSP Claims Controversy: https://web.archive.org/web/20060717010735/https:/www.cohenufo.org/dsp_claims.html\n\nMusic By the Always Talented: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz71_7z7NphLPZ0l_7G3Llg\n\n#ufo #uap #uapnukes #uapdisclosure #ufology #ufonews #ufosightings #uapsightings #ufofootage #uapfootage #hynek #condoncomittee #Jallenhynek #projectsign #projectgrudge #projectbluebook #bluebook #ufocongress #SOL #solfoundation #karlnell #Battelle #UFOreverseengineering #lockheed #skunkworks #lockheedmartin #rosscoulthart #fastwalker #blackvault #slowwalker",
