0	7080	What if I told you the terms we use every single day, UFO and UAP are limited and only
7080	10280	paint part of the picture according to the US government?
10280	15880	Would you be surprised to learn that UFO-UAP encompass only phenomena and transmedial craft
15880	19880	operating within Earth's atmosphere and under the planet's oceans?
19880	27160	In fact, the USG, particularly NORAD and the US Space Force, have an entirely different
27160	34480	designation for UFOs entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere, fast walkers and slow walkers.
34480	39880	Hey guys, it's UAPGurb, I'm back and as always thank you for returning to the channel.
39880	46560	Today we are going to go down the deep rabbit hole of space-bound UFOs known as fast walkers.
46560	51720	Too little the question is asked, how often are UFOs observed in outer space?
51720	58240	Well, the USG is clearly concerned about this question and has a storied history of investigating
58240	60240	fast walkers.
60240	64360	So let's get some terms out of the way and again, remember there is a distinction here
64360	65840	from UFO.
65840	70680	The Walker call sign describes objects entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere at variable
70680	72040	speeds.
72040	78320	Slow walker for low velocity objects and fast walkers, well, you guys can probably guess.
78320	82320	Today we are only going to focus on the latter, the fast walker.
82320	89240	This distinction is crucial as during an age of increasing, albeit surface level UFO transparency,
89240	95000	it allows the USG to avoid declassification slash Freedom of Information Act requests
95000	97840	for fast walkers and slow walkers.
97840	103960	In late 2023, John Greenwald of the Black Vault received a decisive and final response
103960	109640	to his countless FOIA requests on the term fast walkers and slow walkers.
109640	115000	This response came from the US Space Force, the famed USAF space division.
115000	121040	With this request, Greenwald sought any reports, information, detailed military info on this
121040	122040	topic.
122040	129360	In response, Space Force issued a full denial to divulge any material under FOIA, citing
129360	135480	exception one, as a denial to disclose which states quote, under criteria established by
135480	141000	an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.
141000	146160	But curiously, this wasn't actually the first time Greenwald was denied access to any information
146160	147840	on fast walker.
147840	155280	Ten years earlier in 2013, Greenwald submitted a similar request which was handled by USNorthcom,
155280	160520	the United States Northern Command which oversees NORAD, the North American Aerospace
160520	162600	Defense Command.
162600	165960	NORAD is headquartered at Space Force Base in Colorado.
165960	170360	I know this doesn't seem very important now, but keep NORAD in mind.
170360	176840	Anyways, Northcom and NORAD responded to Greenwald stating fast walker documentation is quote,
176840	184720	currently and properly classified, again by executive order 13526, quote, considered
184720	190920	critical to national defense or foreign policy and is thus controlled by the US government.
190920	194520	But there were two documents that were provided to Greenwald.
194520	200560	One, a paper titled Orbit Determination of Sunlit Illuminated Objects Detected by Overhead
200560	208640	Platforms from 1989 and Space-Based Satellite Tracking and Characterization Utilizing Non-Imaging
208640	211640	Passive Sensors from 2008.
211640	217960	But NORAD's refusal to share any data on fast walkers or UFO tracking data doesn't start
217960	219280	with Greenwald.
219280	224840	Check this out, this is an extremely interesting excerpt from the book, Clear Intent, the government
224840	229880	cover-up of the UFO experience by authors Barry J. Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett.
229880	236660	This book contains both a section of the scanned NORAD UAP reporting sheet, but also a chapters
236660	241000	on UFOs and FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act.
241000	246560	Within this chapter is a request to NORAD for UAP tracking data to which NORAD replies
246560	256360	will require over 18,000 man hours and a cost of $155,000 at the time in 1979, which would
256360	260400	equate to well over half a million USD today.
260400	265640	NORAD also refused to waive the fees on a follow-up request three years later.
265640	271680	So let's use the documents provided to Greenwald to get a jump start on fast walkers and utilize
271680	274880	any other clues to try and learn more about them.
274880	280800	We can trace this fast walker designation to originate with NORAD, utilized to detect
280800	286160	objects entering or leaving atmosphere, as I mentioned above, at significant speeds by
286160	288000	US defense systems.
288000	292280	The first of the two documents, the one on orbit determination of sunlit illuminated
292280	297560	objects, was written by USAF Captain Richard P. Ossedax.
297560	303120	And this details the joint efforts of NORAD and the Air Force Foreign Technology Division
303120	309280	to investigate uncataloged space-bound objects detected by reflected sunlight passing through
309280	313960	satellite sensors designated as fast walkers.
313960	320800	This document states that the data on these objects has been recorded since 1972 by, quote,
320800	329040	certain ballistic missile early warning satellite systems located at various geostationary locations.
329040	335680	And also, this paper sought to determine orbit or motion of these objects, but was deemed
335680	341040	unsolvable by former efforts by one researcher, Wong, as mentioned.
341040	346520	Shockingly, the report states the fast walker analysis has become an increasingly important
346520	351760	issue due to the increase in geosynchronous satellites, which detect the objects while
351760	353960	ground-based sensors cannot.
353960	355880	So very important here.
355880	360440	We can assume the increase in detection and database built in 1972 is a result of the
360440	363040	Defense Support Program.
363040	368880	The DSP served and serves currently as the US's primary ballistic missile entry warning
368880	374720	system and its first satellite DSP-1 went into orbit in 1970.
374720	381480	Additionally, DSP information is relayed to NORAD, and remember, DSP is now part of the
381480	383120	US Space Force.
383120	389280	Our second paper on space-based satellite tracking was written by Captain Bradley R. Townsend
389280	394640	in the Air Force Institute of Technology out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and sought
394640	401520	to revisit to determine the orbit or movement of fast walkers again, quote, satellite-based
401520	405800	sensors looking down at the Earth's surface occasionally observe reflected light from
405800	410440	an object passing through the image, which is moving too fast relative to the background
410440	413480	of the image to be located within the atmosphere.
413480	416960	These objects are commonly called fast walkers.
416960	423680	These study comments on the 1972 Ausadax study and referred to the database origin from
423680	427600	obtained ballistic missile entry warning satellites.
427600	432480	Not much else to cover here, as study methods yield similar results with an inability to
432480	438080	determine range to fast walker targets, but remember again that the ballistic missile
438080	443160	warning satellites are mentioned here again, DSP, the Defense Support Program.
443160	448480	Our trail with fast walkers NORAD and DSP Ballistic Warning Detection satellites doesn't
448480	451040	stop with these two documents, however.
451040	457800	For example, on the 6th of January 1967, Scientific Advisor to Project Blue Book Jay Allen Heineck
457800	464080	I talked about him extensively in many videos, like my history on the UFO Stigma, discussed
464080	472000	at Goddard Space Flight Center that NORAD tracks UFOs and has been since 1957, and that
472000	478040	every single continental U.S. military UFO case in Blue Book files are designated as
478040	480000	a NORAD case.
480000	485120	And does anyone remember the Hillary Clinton campaign leaks provided by WikiLeaks?
485120	487680	This is where a rabbit hole gets wild.
487680	492880	Well, pouring through them you can find an incredibly interesting email chain to Clinton
492880	495600	campaign manager John Podesta.
495600	501680	On this email from March of 2015, there is a detailed communication between USG contractor
501880	504320	Bob Fish and Podesta.
504320	509240	Fish was the program manager for several highly classified U.S. government advanced communication
509240	513200	systems projects in the 1980s and 1990s.
513200	517280	These included the White House and several executive branch intelligence agencies.
517280	522320	And for what it's worth, just as a side note, Bob himself was vetted by Ross Colthart.
522320	528720	But anyways, Fish makes an immediate and direct claim that quote, one of the government programs
528720	536280	that collects hard data on unidentified flying objects is the USAF DSP satellite program.
536280	540960	In fact, the main body of this email is so interesting I may as well quote the whole
540960	541960	thing.
541960	546760	Quote, I can add a little insight to rumors published on the web.
546760	552320	While I was never fully briefed into the DSP operation directly, I was introduced to them
552320	556720	as the U.S. prepared for Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm.
556720	561360	On occasion, I had lunch with a few of them in the cafeteria of a highly classified organization
561360	563360	in El Segundo, California.
563360	567680	No one could get into the cafeteria without TS-SCI clearance.
567680	571780	So this was not a lightweight group of gossipers.
571780	576160	One of these times, a member of that group was really excited, said they just picked
576160	579600	up a fast walker, I assume that same day.
579600	584720	He described how it entered our atmosphere from deep space, origin actually unknown,
584720	589680	but of course from the backside of the satellite and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty closely
589680	591840	on its way to Earth.
591840	596600	Not only was it going very fast, but it made a 30 degree course correction turn, which
596600	601440	means it did not have a ballistic freefall reentry trajectory that a meteorite might
601440	602440	have.
602440	607720	So it was under some sort of control, although whether it was manned or just robotic, there's
607720	609760	no way to tell.
609760	615600	Towards the end of the email, Bob references a line in the 2014 Defense Support Program
615600	621920	fact sheet to support the idea the DSP is still collecting fast walker data 24 years
621920	622920	later.
622920	629280	Quote, In addition, researchers at the Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions
629280	634680	of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future.
634680	640840	Remember this line, and remember the mention by DSP itself of the Aerospace Corporation.
640840	647120	Fish also links to a strange, now defunct blog, which I've accessed via the web archives
647120	653120	titled quote, Top Secret Spy Satellite Spot UFOs by Tim Schwartz.
653120	658240	Fish strangely comments that much of the information on this site is correct.
658240	662360	But where else can we connect DSP and fast walkers?
662360	666600	Let's visit a case from the 5th of May 1984.
666600	672080	An anonymous source claims to a journalist named Joe Stafula, a former Army Criminal
672080	678440	Investigation Command, that a highly classified U.S. Defense Support Program spy satellite
678440	680520	detected a UAP.
680520	686560	It comes within 1.8 miles of the DSP satellite before flying below it over the Indian Ocean.
686560	693280	It is moving 22,000 miles per hour, changes course, and allegedly flies back into outer
693280	694800	space.
694800	700320	Since this case is so old and there is so little published about it, tracking this down
700320	702720	has been an absolute bear.
702720	707120	But I have been able to find two now destroyed sites on this article.
707120	712340	And by the way, does this case not sound very similar to the incident Fish was describing
712340	713840	to Podesta?
714120	720560	Anyways, both sites state, quote, this object was first spotted by the ultra sensitive orbiting
720560	726240	U.S. DSP satellite our country uses for detailed surveillance and air defense.
726240	731240	These satellites have the infrared capacity to spot small heat sources on the surface
731240	736880	of the Earth and are time proven as effective monitoring devices, end quote.
736880	743160	Which this lines up with the 1970 Duke paper, where the DSP satellites monitor small light
743160	746200	or heat reflections off of fast walkers.
746200	752360	This ancient blog, Deb's UFO research, provides an interesting depiction of the event through
752360	754560	three images.
754560	758160	Image one shows the DSP one satellite.
758160	762380	Image two shows the fast walker headed left to right towards Earth.
762380	767960	And image three depicts the reversal of the fast walker as it retreats back to open space.
767960	772880	This site also provides an image of the trajectory of the fast walker by Stifula himself and
772880	779240	states, quote, an object was spotted by a U.S. DSP satellite and tracked as it sped first
779240	786240	directly toward the Earth and passed in front and within 15 miles of the U.S. DSP satellite.
786240	791080	It suddenly and without impact or contact with other devices or obstructions curved outward
791080	792880	away from the Earth.
792880	797040	It was tracked for another nine minutes until it disappeared, end quote.
797040	804320	Additionally, the site publishes a recreation or possibly an image of the top secret incident
804320	806000	report summary.
806000	807720	See the incident underlined.
807720	814480	I am still unclear on terminology here such as the UCF listing and the ST in the field
814480	815480	of view.
815480	819800	If you can identify these terms to help decipher this image, please let me know and maybe we
819800	822520	can work together on a follow up to this case.
822520	827040	Stifula states, quote, have been able to confirm that the DSP printout for that date
827040	831440	shows an event at the same time with the same characteristics, end quote.
831440	837240	We cannot use this evidence to prove or deny this case's story and records as true or
837240	843640	false concretely until we can do a full analysis on an entire DSP report.
843640	846160	This case remains speculative.
846160	852000	Our next case with ties to the DSP and fast walkers will actually be familiar to fans
852000	858960	of my channel yet will likely shock you, the 1976 Tehran UFO encounter.
858960	863380	For those of you who have not seen my first grounded flight due to UFOs video, I recommend
863380	864760	checking that out.
864760	893520	So here's a clip on one of my all time favorite UFO encounters.
893520	902640	The link to fast walker was done by researchers Lee Graham and Roger Rager, satellite sensor
902640	906160	technicians at Aerojet in California.
906160	911960	They themselves confirmed that the UFO sighting over Tehran was in fact tracked by the United
911960	915520	States military DSP satellite.
915520	921320	During their investigations, Graham and Rager located a computer printout from the timeframe
921320	927040	of the Iranian UFO overflight, which shows that the DSP satellite definitely detected
927040	931840	a quote anomalous object in Iranian airspace.
931840	937000	After a long and fruitless venture to confirm these claims finding nothing besides a declassified
937000	943080	paper often referenced by Rager titled, Now You See It, Now You Don't, by Yousaf Captain
943080	949480	Harry S. Shields, I was finally able to begin to pull on the strings of the evidence Graham
949480	951640	and Rager proposed.
951640	957840	Within the NYCAP report of the 1976 Tehran incident, there exists a link to a long dead
957840	966320	email chain between Brad Sparks, an early founder of CAUS, the Citizens Against UFO Secrecy,
966320	969120	and blog owner RJ Kohen.
969120	976320	Here Brad raises concerns about DSP-1 detecting the UFO in the 76 case and questioned whether
976320	983680	the satellite actually captured the Mirage F-4s scrambled to pursue the UFOs instead.
983680	989920	Spark references a quote, out of focus graphic image, end quote, that only gives the date
989920	997200	not time of the event and states quote, 238 scans possible SR.
997200	1003600	Since DSP scans once every 10 seconds, this means that DSP scanned an object for 39.7
1003600	1010000	minutes and the SR term listed may refer to strategic reconnaissance.
1010000	1017280	After going deeper, I was able to find an email chain from the now also defunct VirtuallyStrange.net
1017280	1024760	dating back to 1998, which references the DSP connection in the 1976 Tehran case.
1024760	1030840	This email states quote, JPEG is available at the above URL, end quote, so at this point
1030840	1034720	I was finally getting close to finding the actual image.
1034720	1041240	Following the source of the JPEG takes us to a 1997 blog post on ufoworld.simplenet.com,
1041240	1044480	titled quote, the DSP connection.
1044480	1050400	And here we get the out of focus grainy image that supposedly depicts the DSP printouts
1050400	1054840	highlighting the 1976 Tehran fast walker by Graham Enreger.
1054840	1060800	Guys, the only things we can determine from this raw image is a similar to structure to
1060800	1067200	the 1984 fast walker case where the term UCF is referenced multiple times as well and the
1067200	1071160	aforementioned 238 scans possible SR.
1071160	1075080	The rest of the image is illegible and frustrating.
1075080	1081360	Due to my limited graphic experience, I have tried and failed to AI upscale this image to
1081360	1084200	make the rest of the text legible.
1084200	1088800	Also my backwards image search yielded zero results.
1088800	1094280	If you think you can help me make this document legible, please please please email me at
1094280	1099280	uapgirb.com and let's figure this case out together.
1099280	1105880	So there we have it, two cases connecting fast walkers and DSP, but both lead us to somewhat
1105880	1109840	dead ends with insufficient data to further our investigation.
1109840	1113760	I am going to keep getting to the bottom of this hopefully with one of you, but let's
1113760	1117160	get some relevant updates to these cases soon.
1117160	1124160	So remember back how Fish mentioned, at the end of the 2014 DSP fact sheet, quote, in
1124160	1130040	addition, researchers at the Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions of a hazard
1130040	1134160	support system that will aid public safety in the future.
1134160	1141040	Well guys, the Aerospace Corporation is suspected as one of the legacy private corporations who
1141040	1144960	engage in, quote, real UAP research.
1144960	1150100	In ufologist Jacques Fillet's book Hidden Science 5, which accounts for Valet's journals
1150100	1157720	from 2000s to 2009, he along with Kit Green, physicist Hal Puthoff, astrophysicist Eric
1157720	1165440	Davis and Kristen B. Zimmerman, suspect that Aerospace Corporation alongside Lockheed Raytheon
1165440	1171880	and Northrop Grumman are among the USG contractors involved with deep UFO work.
1171880	1177200	And in Ross Colthart's fantastic book In Plain Sight, I would highly recommend reading
1177200	1178280	that book.
1178280	1182760	He writes that a source told him about an aerospace company in Long Beach, California
1182760	1186160	with access to, quote, the wreckage.
1186160	1190800	The source told Ross, quote, the program was controlled by a relatively small group of
1190800	1196240	people, not all in government, including people in aerospace, intelligence, and corporate
1196240	1198680	financial communities.
1198680	1202520	The source said that the company had sprawling gardens.
1202520	1207720	And the only major aerospace company in Long Beach, California that has this type of campus
1207720	1210000	is the Aerospace Corporation.
1210000	1215120	And remember Colthart is no slouch, he is the man after all who broke the grush story.
1215120	1220400	And there is much more work to be done investigating the Aerospace Corporation that is not the
1220400	1222080	subject of this video.
1222080	1229520	But it is interesting to see how Space Force and DSP would be analyzing DSP data with the
1229520	1236720	Aerospace Corporation, a company with possible larger ties to covert UAP study to, quote,
1236720	1242880	develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future.
1242880	1245520	Hey guys, thank you so much for joining me today.
1245680	1251040	I know it just feels like we started to scratch the surface of fast walkers and space bound UAP,
1251040	1257600	but I wanted to make this video for a brief look into kind of how Space Force, USG,
1258320	1265600	DOD, NORAD kind of use the terminology of fast walker to skirt around FOIA and how this isn't
1265600	1266320	a new term.
1266320	1273440	And we can trace back to the 76 Iran case, the 1984 DSP-1 case to, you know, possibly
1273760	1276560	lead some evidence to early fast walker detection.
1276560	1279040	Those two cases are of extreme interest to me.
1279040	1284400	And if you think you can help me out decipher that terminology, find out where those images
1284400	1288800	were actually sourced from or AI upscale them to help me figure out what the heck they are
1288800	1289200	saying.
1289200	1292960	Please again, contact me at uapgurb at gmail.com.
1293520	1296480	And I hope you found that Lee M. Graham pretty interesting.
1296480	1300720	I've actually tried to connect with him on Facebook and so that is pending.
1300720	1303600	I'd like to hear more about his research into this case.
1303600	1308320	And there's actually a lot of interesting things surrounding Graham and some claims
1308320	1308800	he made.
1308800	1316160	I've heard some people liken him to a similar person to a 1980s UFO whistleblower.
1316160	1320080	So should be some exciting stuff on that if I can actually get in contact with him.
1320960	1326000	Guys, please remember if you enjoy the video to like or subscribe and leave a comment what you
1326000	1330800	think about DSP, fast walkers, space bound UAP and so forth.
