00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
Many commercial pilots throughout the history of aviation have witnessed UFOs,

00:04.560 --> 00:09.000
but unfortunately discussing their encounters has been historically taboo

00:09.000 --> 00:14.720
and met with the same cancerous stigma that meets all of ufology. Today I wanted

00:14.720 --> 00:21.000
to talk about the most famous UFO case in Spain, the Manisei incident, because what

00:21.000 --> 00:25.800
if I told you about a UFO sighting a pilot couldn't ignore? In fact this sighting

00:25.800 --> 00:31.240
was so prominent it led to the first ever commercial flight being grounded due

00:31.240 --> 00:38.000
to UFOs. Guys it is UAPGurb I am back to analyze some more of the most interesting

00:38.000 --> 00:44.760
UFO cases and encounters throughout history. Today the 1979 Manisei incident

00:44.760 --> 00:50.320
where the sighting of UFOs caused a commercial flight to be grounded and

00:50.320 --> 00:55.560
fighter jets to be scrambled. Now I'm going to use some of the original audio

00:55.560 --> 01:01.680
of this sighting from the actual pilots in this incident, but upon my search I

01:01.680 --> 01:06.560
found a channel called MPC Flight Recreations who actually incorporated

01:06.560 --> 01:11.800
the original audio with an edit of what this flight and encounter may have

01:11.800 --> 01:14.960
looked like. So I'm going to use some of his clips and I'm going to include his

01:14.960 --> 01:18.640
video link down in the video description. Highly recommend checking that video in

01:18.640 --> 01:24.960
his channel out because it's pretty cool. On November 11th 1979 pilot Javier

01:24.960 --> 01:31.760
Laredo de Tejeda was forced to make an emergency landing of his TAE Super

01:31.760 --> 01:38.560
Caravell and 109 passengers at the Manisei airport in Valencia Spain. This

01:38.560 --> 01:42.920
emergency landing was not due to mechanical failures or rowdy passengers

01:42.920 --> 01:47.440
but because of the pilots fear of colliding with a pair of strange red

01:47.480 --> 01:53.360
lights in the sky. Javier's flight departed the island of Malorca after a

01:53.360 --> 01:58.280
refueling stop for the craft's voyage from Salzburg Austria to La Palmas

01:58.280 --> 02:03.880
near 2247 hours. It's worth mentioning the other men in the cockpit of this

02:03.880 --> 02:10.600
Super Caravell, co-pilot Jose RamÃ³n, Zouaza Nagore and flight mechanic

02:10.600 --> 02:17.600
Francisco Javier Rodriguez. At roughly 2305 hours over the Mediterranean the

02:17.600 --> 02:22.120
flight mechanic warned the crew of two visible powerful red lights to the front

02:22.120 --> 02:28.440
left of the airplane at an altitude of near 23,000 feet.

02:40.600 --> 02:54.480
The crew radioed to air traffic control in Barcelona to determine the source of

02:54.480 --> 02:59.800
the lights but were told there were no other aircraft on or near Captain Javier's

02:59.800 --> 03:28.520
flight path. The pair of red lights appear to draw closer to the aircraft.

03:29.040 --> 03:34.920
The men were able to discern the strange lights as two powerful sources of light

03:34.920 --> 03:40.800
with no visible solid body. When changing altitude to avoid any sort of collision

03:40.800 --> 03:45.680
with the lights the pair mirrored the craft's new trajectory and stayed less

03:45.680 --> 03:48.680
than half a mile to five miles away from the plane.

03:59.520 --> 04:04.520
If you have a new seat, can you tell me if the lights are on the sea or on the air?

04:14.520 --> 04:18.520
The craft's new traffic is close to normal for now.

04:20.520 --> 04:25.520
It's not moving at all now, it's 5-0, the traffic is going to be between 2-3-1-6.

04:28.520 --> 04:43.520
The vectoring of the lights towards the aircraft alongside the fact no other

04:43.520 --> 04:48.520
aircraft were operating in the area, Captain Javier aborted the flight and made an

04:48.520 --> 04:51.520
emergency landing at the Manisace Airport in Valencia.

05:19.520 --> 05:25.520
He rationalized flying near the UFO completely violating all aerial safety

05:25.520 --> 05:29.520
rules alongside the inability to make an evasive maneuver in the event of a

05:29.520 --> 05:37.520
collision was not worth the risk of his crew and 109 passengers. Just prior to the

05:37.520 --> 05:43.520
emergency landing, the crew detected three new UFO signals on radar, each with

05:43.520 --> 05:48.520
an estimated diameter of 200 meters. It's worth noting these lights were

05:48.520 --> 05:52.520
witnessed by Manisace Airport personnel as well as military personnel

05:52.520 --> 05:58.520
specifically Marines on the nearby Manisace Air Force Base. Due to one of these

05:58.520 --> 06:03.520
signatures passing close to the airport runways, emergency lights were lit by

06:03.520 --> 06:09.520
land crew if by some slim possibility, the UFO was actually an errant aircraft

06:09.520 --> 06:15.520
experiencing technical difficulties. Due to multiple sightings of these anomalous

06:15.520 --> 06:20.520
lights, Captain Fernando Camaro was soon dispatched from the nearby Lozianos Air

06:20.520 --> 06:28.520
Base in a Mirage F1 to identify the mysterious UFOs at 040 hours. Here, the

06:28.520 --> 06:34.520
pilot experienced equally or even more extraordinary events than that of crew

06:34.520 --> 06:42.520
TAE JK 297. Camaro was forced to increase his speed to 1.4 Mach or 1,074

06:42.520 --> 06:47.520
miles per hour just to make visual contact with an object he perceived as a

06:47.520 --> 06:53.520
truncated cone shape displaying a bright, changing color. Despite his efforts to

06:53.520 --> 06:58.520
approach the object, it quickly disappeared from sight. The pilot was then informed of

06:58.520 --> 07:04.520
a new radar echo indicating another object may be near Segunto. The pilot took

07:04.520 --> 07:08.520
multiple pursuit vectors to approach the second object including traveling over

07:08.520 --> 07:13.520
the Mediterranean and the nearby Spanish inland territories just to have the object

07:13.520 --> 07:19.520
quickly dart away as he approached. Eventually, as Camaro neared the UFO, it

07:19.520 --> 07:25.520
seemingly responded, acknowledging his fighter jet. It was at this time the pilot

07:25.520 --> 07:30.520
had his avionics scrambled. The Mirage F1's electronic flight systems were jammed

07:30.520 --> 07:35.520
and the onboard alert system warned Camaro he was actively locked on by a

07:35.520 --> 07:41.520
continuous wave missile radar. The UFO then rapidly accelerated away towards

07:41.520 --> 07:47.520
mainland Africa. After nearly an hour and a half of pursuit and dangerously low on

07:47.520 --> 07:54.520
fuel, the pilot returned to base. This sighting took Spain by storm, reaching

07:54.520 --> 08:00.520
its parliament in September of 1980. After some representatives asked for an

08:00.520 --> 08:05.520
official explanation, it's unfortunate that the sighting was dismissed as a series

08:05.520 --> 08:12.520
of freak optical illusions. Okay, so let's review the facts of our case.

08:12.520 --> 08:18.520
TAE flight JK297 observed a set of red lights approaching their aircraft. After

08:18.520 --> 08:23.520
changing their altitude from 23,000 feet to avoid any collisions with the craft,

08:23.520 --> 08:28.520
the object matched the aircraft's trajectory and maintained a distance of 0.5

08:28.520 --> 08:33.520
to 5 miles. Due to safety concerns of the crew, the flight decides to perform an

08:33.520 --> 08:39.520
emergency landing. Shortly before the emergency landing, two more UFOs appear

08:39.520 --> 08:45.520
with an estimated diameter of 200 meters. One object flies close to the nearby

08:45.520 --> 08:50.520
airstrip so on-ground employees turn on emergency lighting in case a rogue aircraft

08:50.520 --> 08:56.520
is in trouble. Multiple marine air-based personnel witness strange moving

08:56.520 --> 09:02.520
lights in the sky. A Mirage F1 is dispatched to investigate and must travel

09:02.520 --> 09:08.520
1.4 Mach to even approach near the object. The pilot observes a conical shape

09:08.520 --> 09:13.520
before it rapidly accelerates out of sight. The pilot is ordered to pursue a

09:13.520 --> 09:18.520
second signature which, when close, actively scrambles his avionics equipment

09:18.520 --> 09:23.520
and onboard sensors. Please note that Kamara also states the object jammed

09:23.520 --> 09:30.520
his attempts to lock onto it with an IR missile. Now what stands out to me most

09:30.520 --> 09:36.520
about this case is not the crew aborting its flight path due to UFOs, but

09:36.520 --> 09:42.520
actually the sensory equipment failure of the Mirage F1. Believe me, this

09:42.520 --> 09:48.520
jamming has occurred multiple times in public UFO military cases. Everyone

09:48.520 --> 09:52.520
knows the story of Commander David Fravers' tic-tac sighting in 04 off the

09:52.520 --> 09:58.520
coast of San Diego. Did you know he says that the object's plural actively jam

09:58.520 --> 10:03.520
the radar and sensory equipment of the jets? And even more interesting, let's

10:03.520 --> 10:11.520
take a look at the 1976 Tehran UFO incident. This famous encounter details

10:11.520 --> 10:18.520
the experience of Major Parviz Jafari of the Imperial Iranian Air Force. In 1976

10:18.520 --> 10:23.520
he was one of two jets dispatched to intercept a UFO that had been detected

10:23.520 --> 10:29.520
hovering over Tehran in his F4 Phantom 2 jet. The first of the two pilots lost

10:29.520 --> 10:32.520
all instruments and communication abilities when approaching the object

10:32.520 --> 10:37.520
so he was forced to turn back. Ten minutes later, Jafari was scrambled to

10:37.520 --> 10:42.520
intercept the UFO. While traveling at Mach 1, the Major observed the object

10:42.520 --> 10:49.520
70 miles out, instantaneously jumped 10 degrees to his right. At this distance,

10:49.520 --> 10:57.520
the craft performed an instantaneous 26-mile jump in under a second. While

10:57.520 --> 11:02.520
approaching the seemingly diamond-shaped UFO, a smaller, spherical object

11:02.520 --> 11:08.520
separated from it and approached the F4 Phantom 2. Jafari's only instinct was

11:08.520 --> 11:12.520
to engage the smaller object with his weaponry, but when attempting to target

11:12.520 --> 11:16.520
the object, all of its instruments on board, including targeting and radio,

11:16.520 --> 11:22.520
went haywire. Frightening Jafari tremendously, he made the decision to

11:22.520 --> 11:28.520
emergency exit if the object approached within two miles of him. The pilot

11:28.520 --> 11:32.520
then performed evasive maneuvers to fly away from the object, where his

11:32.520 --> 11:37.520
instrumentation returned to normal and he regained contact with aerial command.

11:37.520 --> 11:42.520
This Tehran incident is one of my favorite encounters, and soon I'd like to

11:42.520 --> 11:47.520
make a video on global Air Force UFO encounters, but I just wanted to throw

11:47.520 --> 11:50.520
that in as another instance in which a military fighter jet experienced

11:50.520 --> 11:57.520
total instrument failure when engaging a UFO. Like with any credible sighting,

11:57.520 --> 12:02.520
with multiple eyewitnesses and multi-sensory data, we need to visit the

12:02.520 --> 12:08.520
Midwest-level debunk panel. So for this specific case, apparently the lights

12:08.520 --> 12:14.520
the Super Caravelle saw in 1979 were the lights of the combustion towers of

12:14.520 --> 12:21.520
the Escobrera refinery near Cartagena. This stationary lights do not account

12:21.520 --> 12:26.520
for the fact the trained pilots said that the lights approached their aircraft

12:26.520 --> 12:31.520
and maintained altitude while they performed evasive maneuvers and maintained

12:31.520 --> 12:37.520
a close distance the aircraft of 0.5 to 5 miles. Apparently these lights sent

12:37.520 --> 12:43.520
the captain into an anxiety attack, forcing him to land the plane and as

12:43.520 --> 12:48.520
well as the co-pilot and flight mechanic, they did not seem to argue with this

12:48.520 --> 12:53.520
rationale and they must have been inflicted with anxiety attacks as well.

12:53.520 --> 12:59.520
The moving lights that were seen by multiple menace airport personnel and

12:59.520 --> 13:04.520
nearby Marines, as well as the UFO that was seen near the airstrip, thus the

13:04.520 --> 13:09.520
emergency lighting was turned on in case there was a rogue aircraft, is apparently

13:09.520 --> 13:16.520
stars, planets, the same thing with every case. Everything just boils down to

13:16.520 --> 13:20.520
trained pilots and trained observers or people on the ground misconstruing

13:20.520 --> 13:25.520
Venus or Jupiter as a UFO, even though these lights are flashing multi-colored

13:25.520 --> 13:32.520
move or are a craft that are identifiable. The Mirage F1 explanation is both

13:32.520 --> 13:38.520
the most comical and most reasonable at the same time. At this time in 1979,

13:38.520 --> 13:44.520
the Iranian hostage crisis was being resolved and stationed near the

13:44.520 --> 13:49.520
Mediterranean was the US 6th Fleet. The scrambling of the instrumentation is said

13:49.520 --> 13:56.520
due to powerful electronic scrambling signatures on board to LHP to Iwo Jima

13:56.520 --> 14:04.520
helicopter carriers. However, pilot Fernando Kamara rejects this explanation stating

14:04.520 --> 14:09.520
that he was both too far away from this fleet to interfere with his flight

14:09.520 --> 14:15.520
navigation, radio, emergency control, so forth. And this doesn't account for the

14:15.520 --> 14:20.520
truncated cone shape that he witnessed with his own eyes as well as a craft that

14:20.520 --> 14:25.520
would speed away from him as he would approach it going 1.4 Mach. Furthermore,

14:25.520 --> 14:31.520
this explanation of the 6th Fleet does not explain the instance on which he

14:31.520 --> 14:37.520
tried to lock onto the UFO with an IR missile, where his systems were actively

14:37.520 --> 14:44.520
jammed. So to summarize that debunk panel, we have a confusion of stars. We have

14:44.520 --> 14:48.520
a refinery tower that a trained pilot gets an anxiety attack and must land his

14:48.520 --> 14:57.520
plane. And we have a pilot who is seen in a mirage with his own eyes and his jet.

14:57.520 --> 15:06.520
And it's just a US fleet. That's who knows how nearby. So to me at least that

15:06.520 --> 15:11.520
debunk panel doesn't hold up. I think that's a lot of coincidences at once that

15:11.520 --> 15:16.520
just does not stand up to me. I think this case is incredibly interesting and I

15:16.520 --> 15:21.520
think it is one of the world's most interesting cases. And it is, no matter how

15:21.520 --> 15:25.520
you look at it, true or false, the first recorded story of a commercial airliner

15:25.520 --> 15:30.520
being grounded due to a sighting of a UFO. But what do you think on this case?

15:30.520 --> 15:34.520
Have you heard about this case? Because it flies kind of under the radar to me,

15:34.520 --> 15:38.520
but it is Spain's most famous UFO case. If you've heard of it, let me know when

15:38.520 --> 15:41.520
did you hear about it? What do you think about it? If you haven't, what do you think

15:41.520 --> 15:45.520
about it? Think it's real? Or do you think it's fake? Or do you think it's an

15:45.520 --> 15:51.520
anxiety attack by a pilot and multiple eyewitnesses being confused? And I guess

15:51.520 --> 15:56.520
the similarities between that and the 1976 Tehran incident with the Mirage jet

15:56.520 --> 16:02.520
are just bad a coincidence. But I'll be fully transparent. I think this case is legitimate.

16:02.520 --> 16:06.520
Thank you guys and I hope you enjoyed this short documentary, another one. I know

16:06.520 --> 16:09.520
we're supposed to be on our iceberg part three and that will become and I just

16:09.520 --> 16:12.520
have been struck with some inspiration lately to make some of these documentary

16:12.520 --> 16:17.520
cases. I think they're fascinating. I have a ton more. I want to make a sort of

16:17.520 --> 16:22.520
global Air Force UFO encounter video pretty soon. I have some interesting cases

16:22.520 --> 16:27.520
from the U.S. Peru as well and all over the world. So stay tuned. Let me know in

16:27.520 --> 16:31.520
the comments what kind of video you want to see next. Like and subscribe to the

16:31.520 --> 16:33.520
channel and I'll catch you guys next time.
