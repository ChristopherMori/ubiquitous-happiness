description: "A dive into Ph.D. Physicist Kevin Knuth's exploration of UAP physics.\
  \ From his 2023 SOL Foundation talk to his 2019 published paper \"Estimating Flight\
  \ Characteristics of Anomalous Unidentified Aerial Vehicles\", Knuth tackles what\
  \ academia claims is impossible - calculating instances of UAP travel speeds, luminosity,\
  \ experienced G forces, and more. \n\nKnuth aims his focus towards the Minot AFB\
  \ encounter, Nimitz encounter based on FLIR footage/Fravor Testimony/radar detection,\
  \ and the 1986 JAL case. Through his research and calculations, Knuth derives travel\
  \ speeds and G forces that far exceed any capabilities of modern-day engineering\
  \ and material science. \n\nFortunately, the professor tackles only cases with multi-sensor\
  \ data - radar + eyewitness + video. This strategic, scientific approach allows\
  \ Knuth to apply the same rigorous academic approach applied to physics to UAP study.\n\
