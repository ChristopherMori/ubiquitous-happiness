description: "An exploration into fascinating and perplexing sightings of USO throughout\
  \ the 18th-20th century. USO or unidentified submerged objects are the opposite\
  \ sides of the same coin to their cousins UFO. Often considered one phenomenon,\
  \ trans medium UAP these objects perform anomalous feats in fluid mediums and retain\
  \ shapes associated with craft. \n\nIn USO sightings, common themes have appeared\
  \ worldwide over the years. Tic Tac or cigar-shaped objects are often seen hovering\
  \ just above the water's surface, often gyrating or quivering. Luminous balls of\
  \ light are seen rising from the depths to perform what seem like curious maneuvers,\
  \ hovering by a vessel before returning to sea or shooting off into the distance.\
  \ Egg-shaped or elliptical craft are often seen entering or leaving the oceans.\
  \ Anomalous wheels of light are seen varying in size and rotation, often time spiraling\
  \ rapidly and appearing above and below waters.\n\nThis video explores a body of\
  \ sightings from US project Blue Book, the USSR, Australia, 20th-century cases,\
  \ and the anomaly of repeated maritime light wheel sightings. \n\n0:00 Intro\n 01:14\
