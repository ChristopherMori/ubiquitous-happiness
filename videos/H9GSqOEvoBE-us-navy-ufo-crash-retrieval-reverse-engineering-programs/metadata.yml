description: "A Deep dive into the U.S. Navy and UFO Legacy Programs. This investigation\
  \ aims to analyze the US Navy and it's major departments - Office of Naval Intelligence\
  \ and Office of Naval Research and UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation\
  \ programs in conjunction with U.S. Intelligence agencies, including the joint Navy\
  \ CIA National Underwater Reconnasiance Office. \n\nThe project explores September\
  \ 2024 reporting by journalist Christopher Sharp and the Liberation Times detailing\
  \ Naval underwater UFO recovery programs operating alongside the CIA, intelligence\
  \ agencies, and private entities such as Lockheed Martin and Woods Hole Oceanographic\
  \ Institute\n\nAdditionally, this program seeks to evaluate the National Underwater\
  \ Reconnaisance Office (NURO), Navy Special Program Office (NSP), and outstanding\
  \ statements on UFO recovery programs made by senior Naval officials such as Bobby\
  \ Ray Inman, Sumner Shaprio, and Nat Kobitz. Analysis into such programs draws attention\
  \ to the 1960s and the Deep Submergence Systems Project and a possible clandestine,\
  \ compartmented program tasked with retrieving UFOs from the sea floor - Sand Dollar.\n\
  \nUtilizing this information as well as historical testimony of craft stored at\
  \ various naval facilities and a 1991 deep sea UFO triangle recovery in the Northen\
  \ Atlantic, this investigation theorizes Naval UFO legacy operations engage in 4\
  \ major categories:\n\nMonitor, Collect, Store, and exploit.\n\nJoin me as we investigate\
