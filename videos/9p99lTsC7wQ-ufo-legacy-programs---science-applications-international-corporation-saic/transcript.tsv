0	5000	Before the first soldier sets foot on the battlefield,
5000	11000	before the first recon flight takes off, SAIC is there.
11000	17000	Helping the Army and Air Force transform opportunities into solutions for diverse missions,
17000	22000	from mission command capabilities to enterprise IT systems,
22000	25000	and modeling, simulation and training.
25000	30000	We work side by side with our customers to develop field and sustain critical capabilities
30000	33000	for our nation's soldiers and airmen.
33000	38000	SAIC focused on mission success.
41000	45000	Well, that's one of those big Pentagon contractors.
45000	50000	Those of us who believe there is UFO information and craft and materials stashed,
50000	55000	suspect that SAIC would be one of the likely candidates to get that stuff.
55000	59000	It's right in the heart of the larger conspiracy lore.
59000	61000	In fact, I think that was the testimony.
61000	64000	This is an alien reproduction vehicle, and just to be clear,
64000	70000	this means that it is based on advanced anti-gravity and zero-point energy propulsion systems.
70000	72000	Those are the propulsion systems.
72000	76000	They are being manufactured by a consortium of companies that include Lockheed Martin,
76000	79000	Northrop, SAIC and other corporations.
79000	84000	James Defense Weekly, the popular military defense publication,
84000	88000	published an article about SAIC,
88000	94000	and there's a post script to the article that anyone who believes in the science of anti-gravity
94000	97000	to be too arcane, too esoteric,
97000	101000	even for the U.S. Air Force should consider the Electric Propulsion Study
101000	107000	undertaken by SAIC for the Astronautics Laboratory, which is now part of the Phillips Lab.
107000	111000	The study's primary objective was to outline physical methods
111000	116000	to test theories of inductive coupling between electromagnetic and gravitational forces
116000	120000	to determine the feasibility of such methods as they apply to space propulsion,
120000	124000	and in simplified terms, an anti-gravity propulsion system.
124000	128000	It remains for some the ultimate quantum leap.
128000	132000	On this channel, I have discussed numerous DOD contractors
132000	135000	and federally funded research and development centers
135000	141000	with strong ties and paper trails to UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs.
141000	146000	After all, the research conducted by myself and scores of other researchers over the decades
146000	151000	have on countless occasions directly accused the U.S. Department of Defense
151000	155000	and Intelligence community of working in tandem with defense contractors,
155000	161000	FFRDCs and UARCs to reverse engineer exotic technologies of unknown origin,
161000	167000	protected by special access and unacknowledged special access programs.
167000	171000	Overall, you know, the government has been the custodian of a lot of this, right,
171000	177000	and they'll hand recede it out to a clear defense contractor to do some analysis,
177000	180000	which I find highly unethical.
180000	182000	You have basically a sole-source arrangement,
182000	189000	and you allow certain private corporate elements to look at this, develop a potential insight,
189000	191000	and then sell it back to the government for profit,
191000	194000	and I think that's totally unethical.
194000	197000	Whether this be Northrop Grumman in tales of legacy programs
197000	201000	under the Tejon radar site under Antelope Valley,
201000	208000	Lockheed Martin and accusations of constructing the TR-3B reverse-engineered alien reproduction vehicle,
208000	212000	Battelle Memorial Institute and declassified studies of shape-memory alloys
212000	217000	possibly originating from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash
217000	221000	or the Aerospace Corporation and MITRE Corporation,
221000	224000	both founded between 1959 to 1960,
224000	228000	allegedly to exploit technologies of unknown origin.
228000	233000	Much of our work on this channel is spent analyzing the private or semi-private sectors.
233000	236000	Today, I want to dive back into the corporate world
236000	241000	to cover an enormous DOD contractor and defense and technology corporation
241000	245000	that I believe may in fact be even more intimately entwined
245000	249000	with UFO legacy program operations and security
249000	253000	over any other American defense contractor,
253000	256000	Science Applications International Corporation.
256000	259000	Many viewing this video will recognize SAIC
259000	264000	as we will call it from here on out as a usual, tricky customer of this channel.
264000	266000	No longer a piece of lost media.
266000	272000	Back on 17 July 2024, long before his excellent interview on Jesse Michaels,
272000	276000	I relayed the testimony of former US Army Green Beret Randy Anderson
276000	281000	and accused SAIC as the contractor running the Off-World Technologies division
281000	285000	beneath the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane in Indiana.
285000	289000	Today, I'm happy to announce I will be re-releasing that investigation
289000	293000	and while I highly recommend viewing that research in its entirety,
293000	296000	the first time Randy spoke publicly about his encounter,
296000	299000	we will cover his story again today in brief or detail.
299000	305000	The trail of SAIC and UFO legacy programs is not as clear cut and glamorous
305000	309000	as any contractor or FFRDC we have covered before on this channel.
309000	315000	But by studying SAIC, I strongly believe we gain invaluable insights
315000	321000	into UFO legacy program funding, infrastructure, modus operandi, secrecy, and more.
321000	326000	So for this investigation, we will break up our research into five main areas of study,
326000	330000	black-budget moneys, legacy program gatekeeping,
330000	336000	sigh research, technologies of unknown origin, and material slash craft housing.
336000	341000	At the end of this investigation, we should be able to make sense of some interesting questions
341000	345000	such as, what should we make of Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick's former position
345000	350000	as senior research scientist for SAIC in 2000 pre-Aero?
350000	354000	What can we learn from former SAIC employee Denise McKinsey
354000	358000	who discussed obfuscation of funds on enormous defense contracts?
358000	365000	Why has SAIC historically conducted endless advanced propulsion and human psychic research?
365000	369000	And does SAIC really run divisions storing non-human artifacts
369000	373000	below some of the United States premier weapon centers?
385000	388000	And their involvement in UFO legacy program operations,
388000	394000	often called the NSA West, I believe SAIC and their decades of cutting edge,
394000	397000	compartmentalized science and technology contracts
397000	402000	as well as intimate ties with senior DOD and intelligence community personnel,
402000	408000	highlight a contractor entrenched in UFO legacy programs at the highest level.
409000	413000	SAIC is a bit of a black box.
413000	417000	Much of what it does is proprietary or even top secret.
417000	422000	So it's hard to tell whether what SAIC provides is necessary and effective.
422000	425000	To understand SAIC and its corporate structure
425000	430000	that lends perfectly to an institution entwined with U.S. Department of Defense
430000	435000	and intelligence community deep sixth black budget special access programs,
435000	439000	we must first step back and analyze the history of SAIC.
439000	444000	Science applications was born in 1969 from Dr. J. Robert Baster.
444000	447000	Baster served in the U.S. Navy during World War II
447000	451000	before earning his PhD in nuclear physics in 1950.
451000	454000	The doctor's skills were immediately put to work
454000	458000	for the Westinghouse Atomic Power Division on the nuclear submarine program.
458000	461000	Baster would then join Los Alamos National Labs
461000	464000	as a research physicist before joining General Atomics
464000	467000	as the chair of the accelerator physics department.
467000	471000	Quote, I was not the brilliant flash of inspiration type of entrepreneur
471000	473000	and quote Baster would state,
473000	477000	rather he was more of a quote unquote persistent builder type.
477000	481000	Come 3 February 1969, Baster would start SAIC
481000	485000	immediately stacking the company with General Atomic Scientist
485000	488000	and created one of the first employee owned companies
488000	493000	He made it a priority to ensure that every employee owned a part of the new company
493000	497000	even using employee ownership as recruitment and retention tool.
497000	502000	Staff were expected to perform superior scientific and technical work
502000	506000	while also playing a key role in the management and direction of the company.
506000	509000	SAIC's internal stock ownership program
509000	513000	which promised to make government officials rich after they left public service
513000	518000	allowed Baster to immediately pack the payroll with specialist and subject matter experts
518000	523000	but also with generals, diplomats, spies and cabinet officers
523000	526000	SAIC's board and high level workforce was
526000	530000	from the company's inception staffed with high level military
530000	533000	and intelligence personnel with unprecedented access
533000	537000	to lucrative contracts and special access programs.
537000	540000	Quote, they had better access to the Pentagon
540000	543000	than the government's own attorneys, end quote.
543000	547000	Some of these acquisitions included the illustrious Bobby Ray Inman
547000	551000	Navy Admiral, NSA Director and CIA Deputy Director
551000	553000	John M. Deutsch, Under Secretary of Defense
553000	556000	under President Jimmy Carter and CIA Director
556000	558000	under President Bill Clinton
558000	560000	Rear Admiral William F. Raybourne
560000	563000	who headed development of the Polaris submarine program
563000	566000	and many many many more personnel
566000	569000	We will address all of these figures and more
569000	573000	such as Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick in our SAIC gatekeepers section.
573000	577000	Indeed SAIC's ventures were so successful out of the gate
577000	582000	Baster's very first government contracts came from the Defense Atomic Support Agency
582000	586000	where the company was tasked with calculating the output of nuclear devices
586000	590000	By the mid-2000s SAIC achieved unrivaled success
590000	593000	in government science and technology contracting
593000	598000	specializing as Vanity Fair once said in 2007 as a quote
598000	600000	Body shop in the brain business
600000	603000	It sells human beings who have a particular expertise
603000	606000	Expertise about weapons, about homeland security
606000	609000	about surveillance, about computer systems
609000	614000	about information dominance and information warfare, end quote.
614000	619000	By 2007 SAIC and its two major offices in San Diego, California
619000	624000	and Washington DC ballooned to the size of an entire government agency
624000	628000	featuring a workforce of over 44,000
628000	631000	larger than the manpower of the departments of labor, energy
631000	635000	and housing and urban development combined at that time
635000	638000	Current day outside of their major offices
638000	642000	SAIC maintains countless locations across the continental United States
642000	646000	many of which are near U.S. military installations
646000	648000	or RDT&E facilities
648000	651000	such as the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, Indiana
651000	653000	Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada
653000	656000	China Lake Naval Air Station, California
656000	658000	Sandia National Labs, New Mexico
658000	660000	and Crystal City, Virginia
660000	663000	Similar to Northrop Grumman and their acquisition of contractors
663000	666000	such as TRW and Teledyne Ryan
666000	669000	and connections to federally funded research and development centers
669000	671000	such as the Aerospace Corporation
671000	675000	SAIC exhibits a similar, intriguing history of acquisitions, mergers
675000	677000	associations, etc.
677000	681000	One such corporation, allegedly spun from SAIC
681000	685000	is DSAI Decision Science Applications Inc.
685000	689000	founded in Virginia on 4 January 1977
689000	693000	DSAI operated as an employee-owned quote
693000	698000	technical services company with expertise in military command and control systems
698000	700000	commercial information management systems
700000	703000	software development, electrical engineering
703000	706000	telecommunications and physics, end quote
706000	708000	According to some previous whistleblowers
708000	710000	such as the controversial Colonel Steve Wilson
710000	714000	DSAI and SAIC were one in the same
714000	717000	with DSAI featuring a board consisting of the directors
717000	720000	of relevant UFO Black Budget divisions
720000	724000	including IBM, Lockheed, Teledyne Ryan
724000	727000	Aerojet Electro Systems, etc.
727000	729000	Wilson would also claim Bobby Ray Inman
729000	731000	a reoccurring figure on this channel
731000	734000	and member of the board of directors of SAIC
734000	736000	also ran DSAI
736000	737000	To learn more about Wilson
737000	740000	I do recommend checking out my video on Northrop Grumman
740000	742000	and UFO Legacy Program Operations
742000	744000	I will not waste much time here
744000	747000	by reviewing his whistleblower claims again
747000	750000	Let's still briefly mention a handful of Wilson's claims
750000	753000	and why he is relevant to today's project
753000	755000	Wilson would disclose to Dr. Richard Boylan
755000	758000	a UFO researcher with many publications
758000	761000	I approach with skepticism that he, Wilson
761000	764000	was not only stationed at Area 51 S4
764000	768000	where reverse engineered anti-gravity vehicles were tested
768000	771000	but that he also spearheaded Project Pounce
771000	774000	an elite Air Force National Reconnaissance Organization
774000	777000	Special Forces Unit which retrieved downed UFOs
777000	781000	with elements of JSOC, specifically Delta Force
781000	783000	Project Pounce can be observed in the disputed
783000	786000	Majestic-12 Project Aquarius document
786000	791000	and, oddly enough, the 1953 Robertson Panel Report
791000	794000	Remember, the Robertson Panel served as a debunking panel
794000	797000	to reduce public concern regarding UFOs
797000	800000	Wilson would claim the first successful flight
800000	803000	of man-made anti-gravity alien reproduction vehicles
803000	806000	had occurred on 18 July 1971
806000	810000	which saw Admiral Bobby Ray Inman present for the test
810000	812000	Inman, still at the Navy at this time
812000	815000	would go on to serve as the director of the NSA
815000	817000	deputy director of the CIA
817000	819000	vice director of the DIA
819000	821000	director of Naval Intelligence
821000	824000	and board member of SAIC in the 1980s
824000	827000	Wilson's disclosures are indeed intriguing
827000	830000	but should of course be taken with some skepticism
830000	834000	therefore I do recommend also reading a more skeptical take
834000	836000	on Wilson written by Kevin Randall
836000	840000	But relevant to our discussion is Wilson's map of Star Wars City
840000	843000	an illustration depicting UFO legacy program operations
843000	847000	conducted covertly within the Strategic Defense Initiative
847000	852000	also known as SDI created in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan
852000	855000	This SDI program will be discussed again in our project
855000	858000	in much greater detail so please hang tight
858000	861000	Within this chart are numerous institutions
861000	863000	one might expect to be associated with
863000	867000	UFO retrieval and exploitation programs
867000	870000	the NRO, the National Security Council
870000	872000	the National Security Agency
872000	875000	CIA, NORAD and Majestic 12
875000	878000	Adhering to the SDI Colorado HQ and Magi
878000	883000	there exists a list of contractors alleged to engage with the UFO portfolio
883000	887000	alongside the 1010 Special Security Squadron
887000	891000	which quote provides a high level of protection to NORAD, US Spacecom
891000	895000	and AF Spacecom resources located at the mountain
895000	903000	Contractors such as Rockwell, Martin Marietta, Lockheed, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and IBM are mentioned
903000	908000	Wilson would state one contractor paramount to the SDI UFO programs
908000	911000	was Decision Science Applications, Inc.
911000	913000	But here is where things get really interesting
913000	915000	We don't have concrete evidence
915000	919000	DSAI was spawned from SAIC though it is likely
919000	923000	However, we can analyze the evolution of DSAI
923000	927000	I would like to thank Reddit user StillChillTrill for this incredible work
927000	931000	His account is now deleted but I will still link to his excellent posts
931000	938000	In 1998, DSAI executed a merger into a company called DSA Acquisitions, Inc.
938000	944000	that was then purchased by Stephen Myers & Associates for almost $31 million in cash and stock
944000	952000	By 21 August of that year, Stephen Myers & Associates finalized their acquisition of DSAI-DSA
952000	957000	Stephen Myers & Associates eventually acquired Emergent Information Technologies, Inc.
957000	962000	and SMNA changed its name to Emergent Information Technologies
962000	966000	On 6 December 2001, Emergent Information Technologies
966000	971000	sold its Virginia-based government services group to L3 Communications
971000	976000	L3 Harris, formerly known as L3 Communications, is another defense contractor
976000	980000	that has both worked alongside SAIC for enormous defense contracts
980000	986000	and is a contractor I have been informed works directly in UFO legacy program operations
986000	990000	But to fully complete this circle, in July of 2012
990000	998000	a part of L3 Communications aka L3 Harris spun off into its own publicly traded company called Angility
998000	1003000	In 2018, SAIC purchased Angility for $2.5 billion
1003000	1007000	So regardless of if DSAI was spawned from SAIC
1007000	1011000	eventually, DSAI assets made their way to SAIC
1011000	1017000	and another defense contractor highly likely involved in UFO legacy operations, L3 Harris
1017000	1020000	But if that wasn't already difficult enough to track
1020000	1024000	incredibly convoluted corporate structures are commonplace with SAIC
1024000	1030000	On 27 September 2013, SAIC created a $4 billion spin-off
1030000	1035000	retaining the name SAIC while transforming its name to LATOS
1035000	1038000	The primary reason for this spin-off was quote
1038000	1041000	conflicts of interest provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation
1041000	1046000	which prevented the company from bidding on some new contracts because of existing contracts
1046000	1047000	end quote
1047000	1051000	So essentially SAIC had so many contracts and was so big
1051000	1054000	it had to split up to gain more
1054000	1057000	So just to point out, when I refer to SAIC
1057000	1060000	I am referring to both SAIC and LATOS
1060000	1063000	but this gets even more interesting
1063000	1068000	On 16 August 2016, LATOS merged with Lockheed Martin Information Systems
1068000	1074000	and Global Solutions that saw LATOS acquire this Lockheed division for $5 billion
1074000	1077000	And in an additional interesting event
1077000	1083000	on 30 November 2017, Lockheed Martin Services Inc. changed their name to LATOS Government Services Inc.
1083000	1088000	After the creation of LATOS, SAIC announced acquisition of Skeetor Holdings
1088000	1093000	a defense and space manufacturing contractor with specific expertise in intelligence
1093000	1096000	for $790 million
1096000	1100000	This purchase was completed in an all-caste transaction
1100000	1103000	and retained the majority of original Skeetor employees
1103000	1108000	According to a 2008 book, Spies for Intelligence by Tim Shorok
1108000	1113000	Skeetor was a critical contractor for the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology
1113000	1117000	for Satellite Signals Intelligence and Electronic Intelligence
1117000	1123000	The CIA Directorate of Science and Technology, or DS&T, is a commonplace subject on this channel
1123000	1130000	serving as a legacy UFO program office that in 2002 spawned the CIA Office of Global Access
1130000	1136000	Excellent journalist Chris Sharp, myself, and others have accused the Office of Global Access, or OGA
1136000	1140000	as participating in foreign UFO crash retrieval operations
1140000	1147000	I have additionally, when discussing U.S. Navy, UFO, foreign material, acquisition, and exploitation programs
1147000	1155000	discussed the CIA, DS&T, alongside the NRO, Nuro, SOCOM, Department of Energy, and more
1155000	1159000	operating worldwide under-sea UFO retrieval operations
1159000	1163000	I have quite a few projects to learn more about the CIA, DS&T
1163000	1167000	so go check out any of these projects in the video description
1167000	1173000	Perhaps SAIC took note of Skeetor for their expertise in MASSINT, or Measurement and Signals Intelligence
1173000	1176000	a highly classified form of intelligence, quote
1176000	1182000	that uses infrared heat imaging, acoustic signatures, seismic data, and other information
1182000	1187000	picked up by air and ground sensors to sniff out for weapons tests and other activities
1187000	1191000	that other countries want to hide from the United States, end quote
1191000	1197000	MASSINT collection is primarily managed by the DIA and used extensively by the CIA
1197000	1207000	In 2005, Skeetor held a national symposium on MASSINT signature technology with contractors involved such as BAE Systems and, of course, SAIC
1207000	1215000	After all, according to spies for hire, quote, Skeetor may be unknown, but it is definitely not a small player, end quote
1215000	1225000	Also consider me curious and possibly suspicious that Skeetor's old building in Chant Till, Virginia, 14660 Lee Road, to be specific
1225000	1235000	resides in the same corporate park with SAIC, the Aerospace Corporation, an FFRDC I have accused directly as having decades of UFO program involvement
1235000	1236000	and the NRO
1236000	1244000	SAIC's acquisitions and partnerships are indeed indicative of a contractor entwined with UFO legacy program operations
1244000	1250000	Later in this project, we will explore this even further, such as SAIC's relationship with EG&G
1250000	1257000	The contractor Bob Lazar claimed hired him to reverse engineer UFO propulsion systems at Area 51S4
1257000	1266000	Equally intriguing as SAIC's acquisitions are the corporation's intimate ties with US intelligence and NAC for war profiteering
1266000	1275000	From its inception, SAIC enjoyed high-level former intelligence officials on its board, but I would also like to reference a 2018 Baltimore Sun article titled
1275000	1280000	Little-known contractor has close ties with staff of NSA
1280000	1288000	This article, along with the excellent book The Shadow Factory by James Bamford, detail how SAIC basically became, quote unquote,
1289000	1293000	A revolving door between the NSA and SAIC
1293000	1306000	Interesting here as the National Security Agency or NSA is one of the US's big five intelligence agencies alongside the NRO, CIA, DIA, NGA, NRO, and likely the Hidden Neuro
1306000	1321000	In numerous programs, I have implicated the NSA and UFO legacy program operations from enforcing gatekeeping in the form of treat or the tactical reconnaissance engineering assessment team to management of ARV programs such as the TR3B
1321000	1335000	As a side note, an unnamed retired Army Public Affairs Officer friend of mine who brushed up against legacy programs told me he was not frightened by the CIA but was terrified of the behemoth that was the NSA
1335000	1343000	And later on, we will discuss possible avenues of black-budget monies conducted between SAIC and the NSA, so hold tight
1343000	1351000	Keep in mind during our investigation that SAIC is an eligible contractor under the DOD's Corporate Portfolio Program
1351000	1363000	The Corporate Portfolio Program gives defense industrial-based corporations like SAIC access to DOD executives, scientists, and management with broad access to special access programs
1363000	1372000	The Corporate Portfolio Program framework was established in 2020 under then US Undersecretary for Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Ellen Lord
1372000	1380000	In an almost comical sequence of events, Lord would join SAIC's advisory board in July 2021
1380000	1389000	And as we progress in this investigation, I find it prudent to mention SAIC is accustomed to getting their way however and whenever they want
1389000	1403000	Whether this be in the form of acquisitions, enormous sole-source contracts, or war profiteering efforts, many viewers on this channel are familiar with the cries of weapons of mass destruction that fueled the logic behind the Iraq war
1403000	1409000	Now did you know, SAIC executives were involved at every stage of the Iraq war life cycle
1409000	1420000	Indeed, quote, SAIC personnel were instrumental in pressing the case that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq in the first place, and that the war was the only way to get rid of them
1420000	1431000	And when no weapons of mass destruction were found, SAIC personnel staffed the commission that was set up to investigate how American intelligence could have been so disastrously wrong
1432000	1442000	Just to provide some further context here, in 1998 David Key, Weapons Expert and Director of SAIC's Center for Counterterrorism Technology and Analysis,
1442000	1450000	Testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Saddam Hussein, quote, remains in power with weapons of mass destruction, end quote
1450000	1460000	Following the Iraq war, President Bush appointed a commission to analyze how American intelligence managed to, quote, miss the truth about Iraq's weapons programs, end quote
1460000	1469000	The commission published a report just one year later, absolving policymakers and US intelligence from distorting evidence of Iraq's WMDs
1469000	1484000	The commission had direct ties to SAIC, including Gordon Uller, SAIC VP for Corporate Development, Jeffrey R. Cooper, VP for Technology and Chief Science Officer of one of SAIC's major subunits, and Samuel S. Visner
1484000	1491000	SAIC VP and Director of Strategic Planning and Business Development for SAIC's Intelligence Group
1491000	1498000	And now that we have finally set the stage for SAIC and UFO legacy programs, let's begin to dive in
1502000	1510000	You can say categorically you've seen no convincing, confirmable evidence of intact spacecraft kept by the US government
1510000	1513000	No, I have seen nothing that leads me to that conclusion
1513000	1518000	Is it possible there is some secret program that you're just not aware of?
1518000	1522000	I don't think so. I have access to anything and everything I need
1522000	1533000	And the way you combat conspiracy theories and the associated misunderstandings that fuel them is a fact in science and truth
1533000	1542000	So if you've got evidence for conspiracy, then that helps to investigate what the underlying truth is
1542000	1546000	There has been none that has been substantiated for this
1546000	1555000	And everything that has been brought to our attention and everything that was brought to my attention when I was in that position as the director
1555000	1561000	We investigated and discovered that it did not come from where they thought it came from
1561000	1570000	Most everything was explainable through other documentation, other programs, other people that had talked to other people
1570000	1574000	Washington Shadow, NSA West, whatever you want to call it
1574000	1580000	SAIC has served as a revolving door for high level US Department of Defense personnel
1580000	1584000	Since the company's inception, SAIC was aggressively packed with, quote,
1584000	1594000	Former generals, admirals, diplomats, spies, and cabinet officers of every kind to fill the company's board of directors and the upper echelons of its staff, end quote
1594000	1605000	With such high level staff, it is no surprise there are numerous accused high level gatekeepers to UFO legacy programs with aggressive and shocking ties to SAIC
1605000	1611000	Let's reflect on Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, former head of the Pentagon's all-domain anomaly resolution office
1611000	1618000	I certainly hold no love for Kirkpatrick, and I wait for many viewers of this channel share the same sentiment
1618000	1629000	When I was in USDI, I read the transcripts of Sean Kirkpatrick briefing Senator Rubio, Senator Warren, and Senator Gillibrand on the results of his investigation in his
1629000	1637000	Congressionally-tasked Arrow report, and those transcripts which were supposed to be open kimono
1637000	1652000	Here's the truth, Mr. Senator, Mr. Senator, Sean Kirkpatrick, absolutely distorted, downplayed, and can't prove it, but I would say outright lied to the people who have direct responsibility for him
1652000	1655000	Saying what? What did he say? It was a lie
1655000	1667000	So it's more of a lie of the whole big picture, the big picture, right? In the meeting it's, you know, Congressman Rubio, we've heard about this incident
1667000	1675000	We just don't have enough data to go on it to really know what this is. We don't have any way of really figuring out what's going on
1675000	1687000	It could just be an anomaly. In fact, it's most likely anomaly. So starting with an acknowledgement that, you know, you have some data, but we have the insight and the scientific expertise to make you feel at ease
1687000	1689000	Nothing to see here, folks, moving on
1689000	1704000	Exactly. Although there was also political discussion involved in historic discussion, and, you know, I read these transcripts once, and immediately knew that
1705000	1708000	Uh, yeah
1708000	1709000	Veiled threat?
1709000	1720000	No, I knew that I was now something else. I was, I had inside knowledge into the deception of our government by elements of our intelligence community
1720000	1729000	Under Kirkpatrick, Arrow released the abysmal Arrow historical report volume one, which outright lied about some witness testimony
1729000	1742000	This was proven, for example, by Michael Herrera's official Arrow memorandum for record, which showed Herrera did not claim to encounter an extraterrestrial spaceship or US special forces as falsely outlined in the Arrow report
1742000	1754000	Arrow under the direction of Dr. Kirkpatrick additionally in 2022 engaged in DOD contracts with contractor Sand Corp, a company with a speciality in plugging whistleblower leaks
1755000	1774000	I have also in the past shown ties with Kirkpatrick and his good buddy Ronald Moultrie, former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security and board member of both Battelle Memorial Institute and the Meiter Corporation and how Kirkpatrick and Moultrie enjoy debunking claims of UFOs at previous Arrow roundtables
1774000	1790000	The guy that formed Arrow upon whose recommendation Arrow was formed is a guy named Ed Moultrie who is Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and he was on Battelle's board and he scrubbed that from his LinkedIn
1790000	1805000	And my good friend, UAP Gerb, who is an amazing channel, he's a super deep UFO researcher, showed that it was on his resume and then he recommends that Arrow formed, it's like a total conflict of interest, it's insane, it's insane
1805000	1815000	Kirkpatrick during his time at Arrow and post Arrow has frequently engaged in dismissing any and all whistleblower claims, often resorting to emotionally charged outbursts
1815000	1816000	You believe them?
1816000	1825000	I believe that they believe what they're telling me and I, my job is not to, it's not a question of belief, right, it's a question of what can I go research
1825000	1836000	There is absolutely nothing that I'm going to do say or produce evidentiary that is going to make the true believers convert, if you will
1836000	1839000	It's almost like a religion, it is basically a religion
1840000	1847000	Myself and others have wagered Kirkpatrick served and possibly still serves as a gatekeeper for UFO legacy programs
1847000	1858000	This sentiment was shared by witness Ed of the 412th Test Wing who refused to testify to Arrow under Kirkpatrick as according to Ed, Kirkpatrick is an insider meant to squash information
1858000	1869000	The doctor's employment history pre and post Arrow is additionally intriguing, the good doctor has filed many patents including 2022 and 2023 patents for quote
1869000	1874000	System and methods for determining influence of channels in a social network, end quote
1875000	1884000	But that is not our interest today, no instead it is Sean Kirkpatrick's former patents with SAIC including a 2003 filing for quote
1884000	1895000	Holographic recording and micro slash nano fabrication via ultra fast holographic two photon induced photopolymerization, H-T-P-I-P, end quote
1896000	1909000	Between joining the NRO and CIA in 2003 and 2005 respectively and working within the Air Force Research Laboratory in 1997, Kirkpatrick worked at SAIC as a senior research scientist
1909000	1915000	We can specifically review work for SAIC as a senior research scientist in the year 2000
1915000	1928000	Now how interesting is that a senior SAIC scientist went on to spearhead a questionable office in Arrow that was originally supposed to be called the UAP JPO which some have called Project Blue Book 2.0
1928000	1940000	Now flashback to 1987, SAIC had previously conducted some of Sean Kirkpatrick's favorite type of science for the DOE, aspects of turbulence and non-linear solutions
1940000	1947000	Shortly after leaving both the Pentagon and Arrow Kirkpatrick began his own LLC called non-linear solutions
1947000	1954000	As of 1 January 2025, non-linear solutions has been subcontracted by the MITRE Corporation
1954000	1964000	An FFRDC I have spoken about ad nauseum on this channel for DOD indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts for US space com
1964000	1977000	The description of this MITRE contract reads, quote, award of indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for National Security Engineering Center Federally Funded Research and Development Center FFRDC, end quote
1977000	1994000	The NSAC run by MITRE in McLean, Virginia operates to, quote, provide the US and its allies and partners with the ability to anticipate and solve the most consequential national security problems requiring integration across missions, capabilities, organizations, and nations, end quote
1994000	2011000	I do wonder what sort of support non-linear solutions can offer as a subcontractor for MITRE under US space com here, but Kirkpatrick did have previous experience with space com, serving as the intelligence community lead for a US space com task force in 2018 to 2019
2012000	2024000	Now I mention that to recall back to September 2024 when excellent researcher TAG underscore OM recovered FOIA documents from US space com dated 31 January 2023
2024000	2034000	These documents outlined a briefing conducted by Kirkpatrick to high level DOD attendees on, quote, UAP response and recovery and material transfer, end quote
2034000	2040000	I do sure wonder what non-linear solutions and MITRE plan to do with US space com
2040000	2057000	In December 2023 Kirkpatrick also joined Oak Ridge National Laboratory as the chief technology officer for defense and intelligence programs. Oak Ridge is of course a DOE sponsored FFRDC administered by Battelle Memorial Institute
2057000	2069000	These are patterns we simply cannot ignore. Why is a former SAIC senior research scientist so intimately involved with FFRDCs and UARC institutions?
2069000	2077000	I commonly connect to UFO programs after his tenure as the DOD's mouthpiece to debunk UFO information with Arrow
2077000	2086000	Let us now transition to the most legendary testimony of gatekeeping UFO legacy programs in history, the Wilson Davis memo
2086000	2096000	So in this video in the interest of time I will assume the viewer has some knowledge of the Wilson Davis meeting notes so if you don't go check out my first ever video on this channel
2096000	2099000	It's a little rough but still gets the message across
2099000	2108000	In short these disputed but highly likely accurate notes transcribed by Dr. Eric Davis leaked from the estate of the late astronaut Edgar Mitchell
2108000	2119000	These notes recount a 2002 conversation between Davis and Vice Admiral and former DIA director Thomas Wilson outside of the parking lot of contractor EG&G in Nevada
2119000	2127000	The conversation recounts Wilson finding but being stonewalled in accessing UFO recovery and material exploitation programs
2127000	2139000	Protected by the DOD Special Access Program Oversight Committee, SAPOC, Senior Review Group, SRG and a large defense contractor I-Wager might in fact be SAIC
2139000	2149000	According to Wilson he was informed by General Michael Ward to search a special records group in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology
2149000	2157000	Belonging to special legacy holdover programs from before special access program restructuring efforts in the early 1990s
2157000	2165000	In the memo UFO programs were reorganized under SAPOC SRG after an internal audit almost revealed the programs
2165000	2179000	This SAPOC reorganization began on 5 January 1994 when the Deputy Secretary of Defense significantly enhanced and strengthened changes in the DOD Special Access Program SAP management and control structure
2179000	2184000	This newsletter on screen now highlights those changes establishing the Senior Review Group
2184000	2199000	We can also possibly find some useful data. In the GAO's May 1993 report titled, quote, DOD Special Access Program's administrative due process not provided when access is denied or revoked, end quote
2199000	2209000	Which discusses the Navy and Air Force not complying with DOD regulation 6200.2 slash R which discussed special access program access
2209000	2220000	I did find it interesting that between the Army, Air Force, and Navy it was in fact the Army that did comply in some cases for SAP regulations according to this GAO document
2220000	2233000	And according to some of my research this makes sense to me as well as I am familiar with cases in which the US Army seemed to operate UFO material exploitation programs in a strict controlled environment with oversight
2233000	2239000	While Navy and Air Force legacy programs seemed to operate far more loosely and out of control
2239000	2252000	But let's take a deeper look at the SAPOC in its Senior Review Group that was upon its creation by the Deputy Secretary of Defense tasked with gatekeeping UFO legacy programs according to VA DM Wilson
2252000	2263000	Around the time of this restructuring, the SAPOC was chaired by Deputy Secretary of Defense the Honorable John Deutch. Mind you, John Deutch did not restructure SAPOC as DEP SECDEF
2263000	2269000	This was conducted by his predecessor William Perry, but Deutch immediately followed suit in the role
2269000	2278000	Immediately pre his position chairing SAPOC as the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Deutch served as the Under Secretary of Defense for acquisition and technology
2278000	2282000	The same office Wilson learned contained UFO legacy files
2282000	2293000	Now, Deutch here is very interesting. Based upon the testimony of VA DM Wilson, we can conclude with a high degree of certainty Deutch served as a gatekeeper for UFO legacy programs
2293000	2300000	Deutch served as a Director of Central Intelligence, a professor at MIT, enjoyed numerous positions within the DOE
2300000	2312000	And also served as a consultant pre-work on SAPOC with TRW, Los Alamos National Labs, and MITRE, three institutions I directly accuse of being involved in UFO programs
2312000	2323000	But that's not all. Pre-1995, possibly during his tenure as DEP SECDEF and within the AUSDAT, Deutch served as the Director of SAIC
2323000	2328000	And even worked in SAIC's La Jolla office, the same office of Denise McKenzie
2328000	2342000	So, here's what we're left with. According to Wilson, the reorganization of SAPOC and creation of the senior review group directly served to gatekeeper UFO legacy programs from even a three star admiral and DIA director
2342000	2355000	DEP SECDEF William J. Perry conducted such a reorganization in February of 1994 and immediately one month after a new DEP SECDEF is assigned and put in charge as chairman of SAPOC
2355000	2358000	This being a former SAIC director
2358000	2369000	But that's not all. To put the real cherry on top here, even William J. Perry himself who reorganized SAPOC in 1994 once served on the board of SAIC
2369000	2373000	One could be chance, two as a pattern, so let's extend this further
2373000	2380000	During his investigations, Vice Admiral Wilson spoke to two permanent members of the Special Access Program Oversight Committee
2380000	2389000	Brigadier General Mike Kostanik and Paul Kaminsky, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, preceded by Deutch
2389000	2396000	Kaminsky and permanent senior review group member Lynn Wells are both lifelong MITRE Corporation members, but I digress
2396000	2404000	A permanent SAPOC member post-SAP restructuring is Admiral William A. Owens, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
2404000	2414000	Outside of his prestigious naval career and service as senior military assistant to Dick Cheney, Owens additionally served as the CEO for SAIC
2414000	2426000	All in all, the SAPOC, which was restructured in the early 1990s to serve as a gatekeeping structure for UFO legacy programs according to Wilson, saw two of six personnel as former SAIC alumni
2426000	2435000	This is why I wager the contractor Wilson accused as operating alongside the SAPOC SRG for UFO secrecy is in fact SAIC
2435000	2441000	And let's not forget a critical third man mentioned in the Wilson Davis notes, Naval Reserve Commander Willard Miller
2441000	2450000	Miller attended the 1997 meeting with VAD and Wilson and Stephen Greer, and yes, this meeting did take place, this is a fact
2450000	2458000	During this meeting in the EG&G parking lot between Davis and Wilson, Davis flashed a 2002 letter addressed to him from Commander Miller
2458000	2464000	Within the letter, Miller offered to aid Davis and physicist Hal Putoff in their UFO crash retrieval research
2464000	2473000	Miller requested anonymity, clearly this wasn't honored, but offered to connect the men to multiple high value targets and information including
2473000	2483000	A senior official with knowledge on alien reproduction vehicles, a list of civilian DOD contractors involved in UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation programs
2483000	2487000	In a team possibly involved with UFO crash retrievals
2487000	2494000	Where did Miller get this intel? Was it first hand experience, exposure to programs or connections in the corporate world?
2494000	2504000	Because Miller did after all work as a quote senior analyst in future counter threat planning, directed energy weapons, space systems and Navy space wargaming
2505000	2517000	Indeed in a 2000 book called Swamp Gas Times, my two decades on the UFO beat by Patrick Hugh, emails between Commander Miller and Attorney Peter Gersten are detailed
2517000	2519000	Miller believed quote
2534000	2539000	The relationship has both interest in and concern about the UFO phenomenon
2539000	2548000	If there are any keepers of the keys, they reside in DOD middle management and civilian DOD contractors, BDM, SAIC, Boeing, Lockheed
2548000	2554000	And the com-trollers who monitor the flow of money to certain classified and special access programs
2554000	2563000	Outside of the Wilson Davis notes, there are numerous possible high level SAIC personnel serving as gatekeepers for UFO programs
2563000	2574000	Discussed already today and in my previous work, we have the US Admiral, Director of the NSA, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of Neuro, Vice Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency
2575000	2591000	Who went from in 1989 discussing recovered UFOs becoming available for technological research with NASA mission specialist Bob Echler to saying he found plausible answers for all UFO sightings to project unity in 2022
2591000	2596000	We can also take an interesting look at US Navy Admiral William F. Rayborn
2596000	2608000	Alongside John Deutch and Bobby Ray Inman, Rayborn was plucked for senior SAIC roles to stack the contractors payroll with scores of influential members of the National Security Establishment
2608000	2622000	Prior to his retirement from the Navy in 1963 and also prior to his positions within SAIC and the Director of National Intelligence from 1965 to 1966, Rayborn led the project to develop the Polaris missile system
2622000	2632000	The Polaris program, a two-stage solid-fueled nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missile, should sound extremely familiar to some viewers of my Naval UFO Legacy Program's video
2632000	2643000	A small detail, but in this video I discussed how Dr. John P. Craven, Chief Scientist of the Special Projects Office for the US Navy, spearheaded the Deep System Submergence Project
2643000	2650000	and resulting deep-submergence rescue vehicles that I implicated in undersea UFO crash retrieval operations
2650000	2660000	Craven himself stated the aforementioned DSSP and submersibles DSRBs were used for a tremendous amount of clandestine classified missions
2660000	2670000	Craven also stated in his book The Silent War, the Deep Submergence Systems Project, which served to drastically increase the depth at which the Navy could perform undersea engineering operations
2671000	2676000	was created specifically to accomplish retrieval operations under Operation Sand-Dollar
2676000	2691000	According to Craven's memoirs, Sand-Dollar was a clandestine highly compartmentalized project that was tasked to retrieve militarily sensitive hardware and other items of national security importance from the seafloor of the continental shelf in the deep marine environments
2691000	2696000	Craven wrote that this program Sand-Dollar is classified to this day, quote,
2696000	2704000	I was shown an inventory itemizing the items known to be on the seabed and a map of their distribution throughout the world, end quote
2704000	2718000	Outlining the complicated obfuscation of Sand-Dollar within the special access program world, Dr. Craven would state Sand-Dollar was buried within the structure of yet another secret program, itself hidden within the Polaris program
2718000	2733000	Intriguing how Sand-Dollar, what eye wager was a UFO crash retrieval program, was buried under a web of programs hidden within the Polaris program, a program itself founded by Admiral Rayborn who would later on become an SAIC board member
2733000	2744000	Let's finally discuss a possible gatekeeper to waived deep six UFO programs with high level ties to CIA and SAIC, Donald M. Kerr
2744000	2750000	Kerr joined SAIC in 1993 as a corporate executive and vice president and director
2750000	2773000	Kerr's resume includes director of Los Alamos National Labs from 79 to 85, president and director of EG&G from 89 to 92, CIA deputy director for science and technology from 01 to 05, director of the NRO from 05 to 07, and principal deputy director of national intelligence from 07 to 09
2773000	2786000	Recall if you will the 1985 advanced theoretical physics working group and the notes of attendee Oki Shannon, former manager of special projects at Los Alamos and character in the Wilson Davis notes
2786000	2808000	Held at the BDM Secure Facility in McLean, Virginia, this conference classified via DOE controls was supervised by the infamous Colonel John B. Alexander and held at BDM just one year after one of the primary characters of this channel, U.S. Army Inscom General Albert Stubblebine joined BDM International
2808000	2831000	Oki Shannon startling notes from this conference reveal several discussions of interest for this channel, including mention of a major engineering project that existed under Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, naval information on underwater UFO hotspots near Gulfo San Matias, Argentina and mention of an organization that collects, manages and destroys UFO information
2831000	2846000	Scribbled within the notes are actions Oki wished to pursue to continue a quest for cracking UFO reverse engineering programs. Towards the end of this page is a note discussing approaching Donald Kerr for influence and money.
2846000	2863000	In almost every single project I do, I discuss the CIA's Office of Global Access established under the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology in 2003 to serve as a logistics coordinator harnessing the muscle of joint special operations command for foreign UFO crash retrievals.
2863000	2878000	This CIA DSNT was additionally, alongside the Navy, the co-founder of Neuro, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, the U.S.'s most secret intelligence agency and one I have connected to underwater UFO crash retrievals.
2878000	2897000	This Office of Global Access was actually established under the watch of Donald Kerr, former VP of SAIC in the 90s, who remember served as the deputy director of the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology from 01 to 05.
2898000	2902000	How does a program like that get funded?
2902000	2911000	I will give you generalities. I can get very specific in a closed session, but misappropriation of funds and self-fund.
2911000	2917000	Does that mean that there is money in the budget that is said to go to a program but it doesn't and it goes to something else?
2917000	2918000	Yes, I have specific knowledge of that.
2918000	2926000	Do you think U.S. corporations are overcharging for certain tech they're selling to the U.S. government and that additional money is going to programs?
2926000	2928000	Correct, through something called IRAD.
2928000	2939000	In 2004, Catherine Austin Fitts, former Assistant Secretary for Housing and Urban Development, released the now legendary paper titled Black Budget of the United States.
2939000	2945000	Throughout the 21st century, Fitts has identified trillions of dollars spent on the U.S. black budget.
2945000	2955000	Fitts has outlined 21 trillion dollars in unauthorized spending in the Departments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development from 1995 to 2015.
2955000	2961000	Much of this money on UFO-related, quote-unquote, clandestine military R&D.
2961000	2974000	Recently, Fitts made a couple of podcast appearances on Tucker Carlson's and Danny Jones' shows, making some incredible statements regarding one of my favorite topics, deep underground military bases or dumbs.
2974000	2985000	Over the years, Fitts has also engaged in some intriguing discussion of UFO legacy programs on Dark Journalist's page, including UFO economies 1, 2, and 3.
2985000	2993000	Here's the thing, I'm glad you brought this up because I know you've had Richard on, and again, Richard's going to be on the Salier Report next week.
2993000	2997000	And that's Richard Dole and the author of UFOs in the National Security State.
2997000	3013000	Well, that's the best book in terms of describing the mechanisms put in place after World War II to create a far-expanded infrastructure for what I call the black budget.
3013000	3031000	So you literally see the federal credit engineered in a way that can generate trillions and trillions of dollars for an infrastructure of private corporations and investors to control the most powerful technology in the world.
3031000	3056000	To try and figure out what that technology is, you know, is to go down a rabbit hole full of very squiggling information about what is and is not true, but suffice it to say that a tremendous amount of that money has gone into very high technology weaponry and certainly an investment in space and space travel.
3056000	3071000	Fitz is surprisingly well-versed in UFO legacy programs, commenting on covert space economies, breakaway civilizations, the SDI or Strategic Defense Initiative being used to counter extraterrestrial threats, and black budget operations surrounding UFOs.
3071000	3088000	Fitz even once argued to Dark Journalist, up to $60 trillion may have been spent on secret space program and UFO technologies, suggesting TUO or Technologies of Unknown Origin may be worth up to $150 trillion.
3088000	3099000	Perhaps one day I can sit down with Catherine Austin-Fitz and have a very poignant discussion on UFO legacy program financing, but I would like to circle back to black budget of the United States.
3100000	3112000	In the paper, Fitz writes, quote, large portions of the nation's wealth is being illegally diverted into secret unaccountable channels, end quote, to support clandestine domestic military research and development.
3112000	3124000	While stat, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Fitz came across evidence IT slash accounting systems providers were responsible for the obfuscation of funds and omitting data where DOD funds were directed.
3124000	3134000	These included Lockheed Martin information systems, which would later merge with Lados in 2015, IBM, DineCorp, and of course SAIC.
3134000	3153000	One of the things I used to have these fights with the defense contractors because I was required to get the accounts when we, I still needed data and the systems were run by the big defense contractors at HUD, and they would refuse to give me the data so I'd have these wars with them.
3153000	3160000	It's like, who really runs HUD? Is it the defense contractor or is it the point, you know, the person who's legally responsible?
3160000	3184000	And speculating, I'd say they have a very perfect situation to do any type of research they want to under the guise of anything, I mean, and call it what they want.
3184000	3195000	And they definitely aren't working alone in anything. So anybody doing business with them, they are what's called like a conglomerate.
3195000	3213000	There's SAIC, but it's made up of numerous individual corporations, and these corporations, some of them are very well known and some of them are smaller, but they have some very big genius minds there and a lot of very cutting-edge work being done there.
3213000	3229000	And millions and millions of dollars coming in. And since it's privately owned corporations, I don't know, the only people they'd have to report to is the ones they're doing business with and they're contracting with.
3229000	3245000	And so if the people they're contracting with wish to do something that maybe isn't in the best interest of everyone, nobody is going to know about it.
3245000	3262000	It's all kept in-house, the funding, the financing, the contracts, there should be files, there should be documentation, and a regular timeline of events on every project which did not exist whatsoever.
3262000	3271000	And if I'm working in a military division and I have access to all the files, where were these, where was this documentation?
3271000	3276000	So it made me very suspicious of where all this money was going.
3276000	3283000	Let's now reference the 2001 testimony of former SAIC administrative employee Denise McKenzie.
3283000	3289000	McKenzie's testimony is somewhat legendary in the UFO legacy program Financial Analyst Community.
3289000	3298000	After all, McKenzie's experiences were detailed on text in Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document, and she was never heard from again.
3298000	3308000	It's even more interesting, the big defense contractor that does all the UFO stuff, like for the military and the government, is in La Jolla.
3308000	3318000	And out in front of their building, they have two eight foot tall Egyptian statues, and one is holding a pyramid in his hand, and this is the past, and one's holding a pyramid in his hand, and this is the future.
3318000	3322000	And they're big bronze statues in front of this company.
3322000	3333000	In this company, I have on one of these tapes a girl testifying how they put billions of dollars or millions of dollars into UFO related programs, and they create them and they're fake.
3333000	3343000	So when they get audited by the general accounting office of the United States government, it just looks like all the money's going into more helicopters, but it's really going into like UFO related programs.
3343000	3352000	Today, I'm thrilled to announce I have found McKenzie's March 2001 videotaped interview nestled within the files of the DPI archive.
3352000	3356000	I have also found and made outreach to Mrs. McKenzie herself.
3356000	3362000	I do hope she connects with me in the future, but for now let's analyze her complete recorded testimony.
3362000	3366000	McKenzie was introduced to SAIC while working retail in 1992.
3366000	3377000	While working at a fabric store in a San Diego mall, a part-time co-worker of McKenzie named Sophia asked her to move to SAIC at La Jolla, San Diego, where Sophia primarily worked.
3377000	3384000	Denise had never heard of the defense giant, but was intrigued to work a cushy office job on a massive campus.
3384000	3390000	When she first visited the La Jolla site, McKenzie expected to interview for an administrative assistant position.
3390000	3395000	But with no paperwork or meetings, McKenzie was immediately told she had the job.
3395000	3398000	She didn't even know the department in which she was supposed to work.
3398000	3407000	During her first few days in the office, McKenzie noticed her recruiter, Sophia, was not present at SAIC and wouldn't show up for another two to three weeks.
3407000	3412000	During her first three to four days of work, McKenzie had no real tasks.
3412000	3417000	She would wander her building of work to look busy, gauging the department's computer files and personnel.
3417000	3422000	McKenzie would realize she worked within SAIC's military contract division.
3422000	3432000	Within SAIC La Jolla on Campus Drive, Denise would notice a highly classified biological division that featured extremely strict personnel access control.
3432000	3434000	And let's take a quick pause here.
3434000	3439000	SAIC has a history of intriguing chemical and biological contracts.
3439000	3449000	Let's note this 2005 SAIC Research Development Test and Evaluation Group contract that tasked SAIC's McLean, Virginia and San Diego, California divisions
3449000	3463000	to perform biological, chemical, radiological, nuclear, and explosive, or CBRNE work with the Air Force Operational Test Center and Evaluation Center, or AFO-TEC, at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.
3463000	3478000	Kirtland Air Force Base is not only home to a deep underground military installation, but also to Sandia National Labs, an FFRDC, which is a usual tricky customer of this channel for operational locations of UFO legacy programs.
3478000	3488000	Recurring viewers of my channel will absolutely recognize Sandia, and by the way, SAIC has a history of absolutely enormous contracts with Sandia National Labs,
3488000	3496000	such as this 2013 $228 million contract for IT consolidation for, quote,
3496000	3507000	mission-specific information technology research development and integration of capabilities while maintaining high-performance and central-hosting computing desktop services and cybersecurity, end quote.
3507000	3519000	What is interesting about this specific relationship with SAIC and AFO-TEC for CBRNE work we just mentioned above is a quote from SAIC's Senior Vice President Chuck Zhang, quote,
3519000	3537000	under the CBRNE contract, SAIC will assess new and emerging technologies and concepts, will work to determine their technological maturity when operated under realistic environments to help give US warfighters the tools they need to do their jobs more safely and effectively, end quote.
3537000	3547000	It is interesting how SAIC's biological work has been contracted from AFO-TEC, or the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center we just mentioned above.
3547000	3559000	AFO-TEC historically has supported the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Advanced Systems and Concepts, or DUSD-AS&C, for all non-traditional acquisition programs.
3559000	3568000	In the future, I'll be paying much closer attention to this DUSD-AS&C and the office's possible involvement in UFO legacy programs.
3568000	3579000	After all, according to the General Accounting Office in 2002, DUSD-AS&C was responsible for DOD Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration Programs.
3579000	3590000	The connections to our work here are indeed perplexing. SAIC has a history of being awarded sole-source contracts to support the Joint Technology Assessment Activity, or JTAA.
3590000	3600000	A large part of the JTAA portfolio supports the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Advanced Systems and Concepts, or the DUSD-AS&C.
3600000	3612000	Many of these sole-source SAIC JTAA contracts are for work at, you guessed it, the Naval Service Warfare Center Crane, which allegedly houses the Off-World Technologies Division.
3612000	3626000	Funny enough, former DUSD-AS&C appointees have a history of working for contractors suspected of being involved with UFO legacy program operations before and after service in the Office of the Undersecretary for Defense.
3626000	3637000	These include Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Sue C. Payton, who served as a manager of advanced technology and Lockheed Martin before her service in the DOD.
3637000	3644000	But after that brief sidestep into SAIC and their biological departments, let's get back to the story of Denise McKenzie.
3644000	3652000	McKenzie's work picked up when she received numerous letters from U.S. military and defense contractors requesting Project Report updates.
3653000	3667000	McKenzie's immediate superiors blew off the importance of these Project Report updates, instructing McKenzie to issue a generic response to DOD and contractors alike, saying something to the effect of, quote, we're working on it, end quote.
3667000	3675000	Eager to perform efficiently in her new role, Denise McKenzie would retrieve files and computer disks pertaining to the letters she received.
3675000	3687000	Each and every contract file, ranging from recent to several years old, contained only two to three form letters, all stating the same thing, quote, it's being worked on, end quote.
3687000	3693000	Some of these forms were signed by SAIC senior personnel and some were left completely unsigned.
3693000	3701000	These were enormous contracts worth millions and millions of dollars with absolutely zero activity on the contracts.
3701000	3711000	McKenzie reported the missing contract activity to her recruiter, Sophia, who grew furious Denise took initiative to search through SAIC's file database.
3711000	3723000	During her interview, Denise pondered why Sophia, positioned under SAIC's head scientist, was working and recruiting new SAIC administrative personnel from a fabric store at a mall.
3723000	3731000	McKenzie was ordered to bring all files and disks pertaining to relevant contracts to her immediate superiors and to forget all about the matter.
3731000	3738000	In her following short time at SAIC, McKenzie was harassed by her head supervisor, a man named Stuart Stanley.
3738000	3749000	I'm trying to track down this Stuart and while unable to find him yet, I haven't covered a man by that name residing in La Jolla San Diego at the time of Denise's employment at SAIC.
3749000	3759000	McKenzie's final straw occurred at the contractor when she choked on food and her immediate supervisor stood by and watched instead of attempting to help or to call an ambulance.
3759000	3772000	After leaving the company, McKenzie would search the early internet for her recruiter, Sophia, and would eventually find an image of Sophia on a CIA website with a different first name and same last name.
3772000	3783000	This webpage listed deceased agents and while her incident took place in 1992, quote unquote, Sophia had supposedly died in 1987 or 1988.
3783000	3794000	Remember if you will, SAIC's relationship with the NSA, intimate ties with the US Big Five intelligence agencies appear rampant with SAIC.
3794000	3800000	I thought they were getting a lot of money for doing nothing and I didn't know where that money was going.
3800000	3818000	It's like a friend, a friend for something. I mean, if it wasn't such a big complex and evidently well known, which I found out, you know, as I worked there, I would have been very suspicious of what was going on.
3818000	3831000	And if you wanted to just hide funds or push funds through and call it whatever you want, Joe's Market, I mean, it was like Joe's Market on a huge scale.
3831000	3838000	So what was I to do about it? I mean, there wasn't much I could say or do about it.
3838000	3850000	Mackenzie was not the only SAIC employee in 1992 to make such allegations. According to the excellent 2007 Vanity Fair article titled Washington's Shadow, quote,
3850000	3860000	According to one former executive in a sworn deposition in 1992, the practice of quote unquote mischarging became institutionalized within the company, end quote.
3860000	3871000	Analyzing Mackenzie's testimony, we can see SAIC ran enormous contracts with DoD and other contractors with absolutely zero activity on these contracts.
3871000	3879000	This implies these monies were funneled from legitimate projects into more secret black budget clandestine operations.
3879000	3883000	And perhaps we have a real instance of this we can analyze.
3891000	3898000	Banning into space, a layered defense to protect the country from nuclear devastation.
3898000	3908000	U.S. spy satellites would watch the world below, detect Soviet missiles blasting off, compute the position and speed of each missile,
3908000	3913000	alert battle stations in space on Earth.
3913000	3921000	The first response, space-based kinetic energy weapons fire high-speed projectiles from hypervelocity guns,
3921000	3926000	intercepting enemy missiles as they are boosted through the atmosphere.
3926000	3936000	Popped up into space, Earth-based nuclear-powered X-ray lasers fire their radioactive rays.
3937000	3944000	Attack rays from land-based eczema lasers are redirected by huge mirrors orbiting in space.
3944000	3952000	Chemical lasers fire beams that burn through the shell of the onrushing missile.
3952000	3957000	Particle beam weapons with pulsing rays join the attack.
3957000	3959000	Still over the atmosphere.
3959000	3964000	In the same year of 1992, then-Secretary of Defense, the infamous Dick Cheney,
3964000	3970000	was called to investigate whistleblower claims of fraud and waste surrounding the Strategic Defense Initiative.
3970000	3977000	Since 1986, scientist Aldrich Saussier claimed the SDI, or Star Wars program,
3977000	3980000	displayed a pattern of, quote, miss-management and abuse,
3980000	3983000	and wasteful spending on research and development,
3983000	3987000	end quote, miss-reporting and misleading Congress of its efficacy.
3987000	3992000	Saussier was dismissed from the Star Wars program for, quote, poor performance
3992000	3995000	and was even investigated by the FBI.
3995000	4001000	Democratic Congressman John Conyers determined actions against Saussier were whistleblower retaliatory activities.
4001000	4007000	And by 1992, Cheney reviewed the case and Saussier was given whistleblower protection.
4007000	4010000	But why is any of this important here?
4010000	4018000	I have talked in several projects of backdoor UFO programs being built into Ronald Reagan's 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative,
4018000	4023000	a missile defense system built to defend the United States from attacks by ballistic nuclear missiles.
4023000	4028000	Let's break this down in a second, but since SDI's inception in 1983,
4028000	4032000	U.S. contractors including SAIC and their systems integrator abilities
4032000	4038000	were relied on more than ever by the Defense Department for successful implementation of SDI.
4038000	4044000	In 1985, SAIC had an employee, retired USAF two-star general Jasper Welch
4044000	4047000	that exclusively coordinated with Star Wars efforts.
4047000	4053000	In 1985, SAIC had won more strategic defense initiative-related contracts
4053000	4058000	than General Dynamics, Northrop, Raytheon, Grumman, and the Rand Corporation combined.
4058000	4063000	Beginning in 1978 and throughout Star Wars, SAIC was, quote,
4063000	4069000	best represented contractor, end quote, for a key SDI technology, particle beam weapons.
4069000	4073000	So essentially, SAIC had been accused by Catherine Austin Fitz
4073000	4078000	as back-channeling money from legitimate contracts into clandestine operations.
4078000	4082000	Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative was proven by the whistleblower claims of
4082000	4087000	Aldrich Saussier to purposely mislead Congress on the efficacy of SDI,
4087000	4091000	end quote, wasteful spending on research and development, end quote.
4091000	4099000	And SAIC was considered a critical contractor for their expertise and reliability for critical work on SDI.
4099000	4102000	Now I just previously said there are numerous implications
4102000	4110000	SDI actually held a swath of UFO programs that saw secret monies backchannel from primarily SDI funding mechanisms.
4110000	4117000	With SAIC's work on SDI and history of illegally diverting funds from legitimate to black-budget contracts,
4117000	4123000	I do not at all think it is a stretch to assume SAIC was one of the primary contractors
4123000	4127000	engaged with SDI and UFO legacy programs.
4127000	4131000	Previously, I discussed the involvement of Northrop, the Grumman Corporation,
4131000	4137000	and Teledyne Ryan, a Northrop Grumman purchase in regards to SDI and UFO programs,
4137000	4140000	but today we have much more to discuss.
4140000	4146000	One whistleblower I have covered in depth on this channel is former USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet
4146000	4152000	in his claims of the reverse engineered alien reproduction vehicle called the TR-3B.
4152000	4158000	As I have stated before, although Fouchet was unable to provide material evidence for the existence of TR-3B,
4158000	4163000	his disclosures have served to deliver some extremely actionable intelligence.
4163000	4167000	During his 1998 disclosures, Fouchet would discuss the DARCE,
4167000	4172000	the Defense Advanced Research Center allegedly stationed underground near Area 51 Grum Lake
4172000	4177000	that worked on UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation projects.
4177000	4180000	The DARCE in question, the Defense Advanced Research Center,
4180000	4184000	not to be confused with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency,
4184000	4187000	was actually a proposed institution.
4187000	4193000	So let's reference this declassified Advanced Research Project Agency study written in 1973.
4193000	4199000	The study in question was written as a historical evaluation of the R&D Management Institution, ARPA,
4199000	4201000	who at this time had, quote,
4201000	4207000	remarkably little in the way of an official record or institutional memory had been established, end quote.
4207000	4213000	On page 82 of the document under ARPA Laboratories discussing advanced aerospace projects,
4213000	4217000	we find a DOD directive showing the Army Ballistic Missile Agency
4217000	4222000	was considered for transfer into the DARCE, the Defense Advanced Research Center,
4222000	4225000	linking the department to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
4225000	4228000	And it is worth noting the Army Ballistic Missile Agency
4228000	4231000	was commanded by Nazi V-2 rocket scientist
4231000	4234000	in Operation Paperclip Transfer, Werner von Braun.
4234000	4238000	Von Braun's mentor was father of German rocketry, Hermann Oberth,
4238000	4241000	who performed extensive study on UFOs.
4241000	4247000	And I've previously covered how extensively Nazi scientists were involved in early UFO programs,
4247000	4252000	such as discussing Hans Kamler, director of numerous Nazi special weapons projects
4252000	4257000	who may have been tasked with studying the 1933 Magenta Italy crashed UFO,
4257000	4260000	who curiously went missing near the end of the war,
4260000	4263000	but was claimed to be working with Americans post-World War II,
4263000	4267000	as well as Xavier Dorsch, head of the TOT organization,
4267000	4273000	who was requested by Air Material Command for Operation Paperclip for underground plant construction.
4273000	4277000	Fusche would state DARCE was bolstered in the mid-1980s
4277000	4281000	when the institution was flushed with money from the Strategic Defense Initiative.
4281000	4286000	Fusche and his sources estimated up to 35% of SDI's funding
4286000	4290000	was siphoned off to support the UFO Black programs.
4290000	4294000	Indeed, for its maiden operational flight in the mid-1990s,
4294000	4300000	Fusche would state the TR-3B, whose program was administrated by the NRO, NSA, and CIA,
4300000	4305000	and worked primarily by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, and Teledyne Ryan,
4305000	4309000	the reverse engineered vehicle was built by Strategic Defense Initiative money.
4309000	4313000	In 2013, stealth aircraft researcher Joseph Jones
4313000	4316000	would claim the existence of Project Brilliant Buzzard,
4316000	4319000	a codename for an airborne surveillance and tracking program
4319000	4323000	that dealt with setting up an electromagnetic shield around the US,
4323000	4326000	utilizing an enormous boomerang-shaped craft.
4326000	4330000	This boomerang featured an almost indefinite loiter time,
4330000	4334000	and Brilliant Buzzard was allegedly primarily contracted to Boeing.
4334000	4340000	The Brilliant Buzzard craft was seemingly responsible for 25,000 eye-witness sightings
4340000	4345000	between 1983 and 1989 of the Hudson Valley boomerang,
4345000	4351000	and this enormous craft was, of course, allegedly a program born from the Strategic Defense Initiative.
4351000	4355000	Viewers of my channel will know I adore referencing the work of legendary
4355000	4358000	UFO crash retrieval investigator Leonard Stringfield
4358000	4363000	to analyze relevant UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation cases.
4363000	4367000	And as it turns out, we do have a rather intriguing Star Wars case
4367000	4370000	in crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7,
4370000	4375000	specifically 1991's UFO crash retrievals the Inner Sanctum Status Report 6.
4375000	4380000	Stringfield's eclectic work analyzed a 1989 UFO crash retrieval case
4380000	4385000	alleged to have occurred over Maritius Bay, Long Island, New York, USA.
4385000	4390000	Now, be mindful that there is an additional Long Island, New York UFO crash retrieval case
4390000	4393000	that allegedly occurred in 1992.
4393000	4397000	This 92 case is indeed perplexing and features numerous eye-witnesses
4397000	4400000	and the possible involvement of the Department of Energy's
4400000	4405000	FFRDC Brookhaven National Laboratory located in Upton, New York.
4405000	4409000	Perhaps we will revisit this case in an extended session soon,
4409000	4412000	but let's circle back to 1989, the work of Stringfield
4412000	4417000	and reporting from LIUFON, the Long Island UFO Network.
4417000	4421000	This case details a crashed UFO in the area of Maritius Bay
4421000	4425000	off the south shore of Suffolk County, Long Island, New York
4425000	4429000	on the early morning of 29 September 1989.
4429000	4434000	And according to LIUFON and Stringfield, the craft crashing was not an accident,
4434000	4440000	but instead a carefully planned and executed military intelligence operation to down the craft.
4440000	4444000	According to an anonymous Air Force Intelligence Colonel,
4444000	4450000	the incident involved the downing of a UFO by the use of a US Star Wars weapon on that night.
4450000	4455000	The craft crashed into the Dune area where it was subsequently retrieved, end quote.
4455000	4458000	Quite shockingly, this unnamed Colonel additionally stated
4458000	4462000	18 US servicemen were killed by biologics on board the craft
4462000	4465000	who retaliated with a device that quote,
4465000	4468000	generates extremely low frequency sound waves
4468000	4471000	which can destroy the molecular cohesiveness of known matter.
4471000	4475000	Quite the extraordinary claim and a claim that I can find no record of
4475000	4478000	regarding the deaths of several US servicemen.
4478000	4481000	However, multiple eyewitnesses including a commodities broker
4481000	4485000	claimed to have seen helicopters transporting a large object
4485000	4490000	and military vehicles with a police escort headed towards Brookhaven National Labs.
4490000	4494000	Another anonymous source, this time a Brookhaven scientist named Dr. Nick,
4494000	4498000	told LIUFON investigators a large wedge or boomerang shaped object
4498000	4502000	with shockingly low mass was recovered and transported to Brookhaven.
4502000	4506000	Having previously worked under Wright Patterson AFB to study UFOs,
4506000	4513000	Dr. Nick claimed the weapon utilized to down the craft was constructed by AIL electronics.
4513000	4516000	Now remember how the anonymous Colonel claimed the craft was down
4516000	4518000	by a strategic defense initiative weapon
4518000	4522000	and according to Dr. Nick, Brookhaven National Labs deployed this weapon.
4522000	4527000	Brookhaven is of course a Department of Energy sponsored FFRDC.
4527000	4530000	Brookhaven additionally did work on the strategic defense initiative
4530000	4535000	such as aiding in SDI's lethality and target hardening projects.
4535000	4539000	Reference for example this 1987 DTIC document titled
4539000	4543000	Report to the Congress on Strategic Defense Initiative and quote
4543000	4547000	Alongside White Sands missile range and Los Alamos National Labs,
4547000	4551000	Brookhaven aided SDI through study and testing of SDI weapons
4551000	4555000	that quote required lethal energy to achieve a sure kill
4555000	4558000	against the full spectrum of enemy targets.
4558000	4561000	One contractor that worked alongside Brookhaven,
4561000	4566000	White Sands and Los Alamos for SDI's lethality and target hardening program
4566000	4568000	was of course SAIC.
4568000	4572000	Interesting how SAIC and Brookhaven which was allegedly involved
4572000	4575000	with shooting down a UFO over Long Island, New York
4575000	4579000	both worked on SDI's and specifically the Defense Nuclear Agency's
4579000	4583000	lethality and target hardening programs that had a specific goal
4583000	4588000	of assessing the lethality of X-ray laser weapons against SDI threats.
4588000	4593000	All this boils down of course to the subject of directed energy weapons.
4593000	4597000	Sources of mine have specifically informed me of SDI X-ray weapons
4597000	4601000	that were used to disable and down UFOs.
4601000	4604000	These connections between SAIC, black budget monies
4604000	4607000	and Reagan's strategic defense initiative are quite potent
4607000	4611000	and well worth exploring further in our future studies.
4611000	4616000	SAIC's misappropriation of funds doesn't just stop with the testimony of Mackenzie
4616000	4619000	or likely involvement with SDI UFO programs.
4619000	4625000	No, we have very real examples of SAIC wasting obscene amounts of money on contracts.
4625000	4631000	In 2002, a consortium run by SAIC including Boeing and Booz Allen Hamilton
4631000	4635000	was chosen by the National Security Agency to create Trailblazer.
4635000	4639000	A system intended to analyze mass collections of data on communication methods
4639000	4642000	such as cell phones, email, and internet.
4642000	4646000	This contract was worth at its inception over $280 million
4646000	4650000	and ballooned to billions within four years.
4650000	4654000	This program was even worked on by SAIC board member Bobby Ray Inman.
4654000	4659000	Multiple NSA employees filed a complaint with the DoD Inspector General
4659000	4665000	regarding enormous amounts of fraud, waste, and abuse existing in SAIC's Trailblazer
4665000	4669000	when a successful operating prototype had already previously existed.
4669000	4674000	By 2005, the DoD Inspector General released a report on the investigation
4674000	4677000	where 90-plus percent of the findings were redacted.
4677000	4681000	Some of the whistleblowers here including NSA employee William Binney
4681000	4684000	were harassed and raided by the FBI.
4684000	4688000	Interesting how Binney has additionally commented on UFOs.
4688000	4693000	Well, I think my problem is just like the UFO thing.
4693000	4696000	Unless they start addressing these kinds of things,
4696000	4701000	that people's observations or basic measurements or facts
4701000	4704000	will kind of evidence that simply exist.
4704000	4707000	Unless they start addressing them, there's always going to be questions
4707000	4709000	that people are going to question and never trust.
4709000	4713000	I mean, especially now with the government, how much trust do you have in this government?
4713000	4717000	Bizarrely, after the colossal failure that was Trailblazer,
4717000	4721000	SAIC was immediately awarded a contract for Execute Locust,
4721000	4727000	a revised Trailblazer program well worth $361 million.
4727000	4731000	SAIC's failed efforts on enormous contracts are not uncommon.
4731000	4734000	Take VCF for example, Virtual Case File,
4734000	4738000	a $124 million contract with the FBI
4738000	4742000	to create an online central repository of data to serve the FBI.
4742000	4745000	Only three years into Virtual Case File,
4745000	4749000	the project was written off by a global publication for technology professionals
4749000	4751000	as the, quote,
4751000	4755000	most highly publicized software failure in history, end quote.
4755000	4759000	According to the 2007 Vanity Fair article on SAIC,
4759000	4761000	we discussed earlier, quote,
4761000	4763000	If it turns out they can't deliver,
4763000	4766000	new contracts will simply be drawn up, end quote.
4766000	4771000	Indeed, SAIC's convenient ineptitude to secure lucrative contracts for no work
4771000	4774000	and whopping failures doesn't just end here.
4774000	4778000	In 2005, SAIC's La Jolla San Diego location,
4778000	4782000	which was patrolled by DOD certified industrial security personnel,
4782000	4784000	was broken into.
4784000	4787000	This never solved burglary, according to SAIC,
4787000	4790000	saw the theft of one desktop computer and four laptops
4790000	4794000	out of 13 private offices containing personal data
4794000	4797000	on thousands of present and past employees.
4797000	4800000	Presumably including the company's many former CIA operatives
4800000	4803000	and SA executives and Pentagon officials,
4803000	4805000	quite the targeted theft here.
4805000	4810000	And I really cannot stress here how many incredibly suspicious and dubious actions
4810000	4814000	SAIC has conducted over the years that speaks to misappropriation
4814000	4817000	and funneling of funds used, in my opinion,
4817000	4820000	for black budget UFO programs.
4820000	4824000	Further examples in this laundry list include SAIC defrauding
4824000	4828000	the U.S. government from 1987 to 1995
4828000	4832000	by creating fake, non-functioning prototypes for a USAF contract
4832000	4835000	to develop flat panel liquid crystal displays
4835000	4837000	to be used on various fighter jets.
4837000	4842000	As well as an early 2000s incident in which SAIC was charged with fraud
4842000	4845000	for submitting, quote, false and fraudulent statements
4845000	4847000	of its expected cost and profits,
4847000	4851000	and quote, for waste cleanup at various U.S. Air Force bases.
4851000	4855000	But before we move on here, I would like to touch on some of the relationships
4855000	4858000	SAIC has maintained with DOD defense contractors
4858000	4861000	that have been time and time again implicated
4861000	4864000	with black budget projects and UFO legacy programs.
4864000	4867000	I'd like to draw your attention back to EG&G,
4867000	4871000	also known as Edgerton, Germanhausen and Greer Inc.
4871000	4873000	and I would wager most on this channel
4873000	4876000	have some familiarity with this intriguing contractor
4876000	4882000	that historically engaged closely with some of the U.S.'s most secret technologies.
4882000	4887000	Started by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Harold Edgerton in 1931,
4887000	4891000	EG&G's activities are legendary in the UFO community
4891000	4898000	before the company was acquired by URS in 2002 and again by AECOM in 2014.
4898000	4902000	Historically, EG&G shared responsibility at the Nevada test site
4902000	4905000	including Nellis Air Force Base in Area 51
4905000	4908000	for weapons development and high-tech testing
4908000	4912000	alongside Lawrence Livermore Labs, Raytheon and others.
4912000	4915000	EG&G's legendary status in the UFO community
4915000	4919000	arose from it being labeled as the contractor Bob Lazar claimed
4919000	4925000	hired him to reverse engineer UFO propulsion systems at Area 51 site 4.
4925000	4930000	Quite recently, I also discussed how EG&G was one of multiple components connected
4930000	4934000	with UFO legacy programs that comprised the Department of Energy NEST
4934000	4936000	or Nuclear Emergency Response Team
4936000	4940000	and how I wagered the DOE NEST supported by EG&G
4940000	4943000	was the on-site technical and scientific team
4943000	4948000	that recovered a crashed UFO in the Peruvian jungle in 1997
4948000	4951000	witnessed by USMC Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan.
4951000	4954000	According to journalist George Knapp, Alfred O'Donnell,
4954000	4957000	a now deceased former senior manager at EG&G,
4957000	4961000	relayed to Knapp that quote-unquote they, meaning EG&G,
4961000	4965000	had in its possession a flying saucer recovered in New Mexico
4965000	4969000	as well as live non-human beings that looked vaguely human.
4969000	4973000	Remember EG&G but just stick around here with me for a second
4973000	4976000	as I state to probably an annoying degree
4976000	4979000	a key component overlooked from joint USG contractor
4979000	4983000	UFO legacy program operations are the subject matter experts
4983000	4989000	and R&D ACES, FFRDCs are federally funded research and development centers.
4989000	4993000	Over the course of my work, I have accused numerous such FFRDCs
4993000	4997000	as acting as key players in UFO material exploitation
4997000	5001000	and crash retrieval programs including Sandia National Labs,
5001000	5005000	Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Los Alamos National Labs,
5005000	5008000	the Center for Naval Analysis, the MITRE Corporation,
5008000	5010000	the RAND Corporation and more.
5010000	5013000	The Administrator for Los Alamos National Labs, for example,
5013000	5015000	on behalf of the Department of Energy
5015000	5020000	is a little known corporation known as Triad National Security LLC.
5020000	5025000	Triad National Security has a storied history of intriguing publications
5025000	5030000	but relevant to our discussion is how Triad is comprised of three entities,
5030000	5034000	Texas A&M University, the University of California
5034000	5036000	and Battelle Memorial Institute.
5036000	5040000	Alongside FFRDCs, I have spoken on their university
5040000	5042000	semi-private counterparts, UARCs,
5042000	5044000	or university affiliated research centers
5044000	5047000	and their involvement in UFO legacy programs.
5047000	5051000	The two universities comprising Triad are not UARCs,
5051000	5053000	but interesting nonetheless.
5053000	5056000	The contractor here of interest within Triad is Battelle
5056000	5059000	and Battelle is no stranger to this channel.
5059000	5063000	From its possible involvement studying Roswell Shape Memory Alloys
5063000	5066000	to its parallel project Blue Book called Project Stork
5066000	5068000	to research associating Battelle
5068000	5071000	to dugway-proving ground UFO legacy programs,
5071000	5074000	Battelle is infamous on this channel.
5074000	5078000	Battelle itself runs multiple FFRDCs including Oak Ridge,
5078000	5082000	a Sean Kirkpatrick safe haven post-arrow where he joined as CTO,
5082000	5084000	Savannah River National Labs,
5084000	5087000	and the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center,
5087000	5092000	all of whom I suspect are involved in UFO legacy programs.
5092000	5095000	So isn't it interesting that Battelle formed a new LLC
5095000	5100000	under a trio of institutions to manage sites for the Department of Energy?
5100000	5102000	Here we can finally circle back.
5102000	5107000	On 15 September 2004, SAIC entered into a similar venture.
5107000	5110000	Analyzing a Form 10 SEC document,
5110000	5114000	we can see that in 2004 SAIC entered into an agreement
5114000	5116000	with EG&G Technical Services,
5116000	5120000	as well as Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, Inc.
5120000	5125000	to form RDS, Research and Development Solutions, LLC.
5125000	5128000	A now defunct group, RDS was quickly assigned
5128000	5132000	to the Department of Energy's National Energy Technical Laboratory
5132000	5137000	shortly after its founding with a total value of $217 million.
5137000	5140000	Indeed, by 27 September 2004,
5140000	5143000	RDS was securing even more contracts with DOE,
5143000	5147000	with some contracts of up to $41 million.
5147000	5150000	The DOE's National Energy Technical Laboratory's mission
5150000	5154000	is to, quote, advance the national economic and energy security
5154000	5156000	of the United States, end quote.
5156000	5162000	In RDS's founding year, the NETL had a budget of over $900 million,
5162000	5166000	which was used for R&D programs in support of the DOE's offices
5166000	5171000	of fossil energy, energy efficiency and renewable energy and energy assurance,
5171000	5174000	as well as work with other federal agencies.
5174000	5176000	RDS was brought on to, quote,
5176000	5179000	support the management and integration of all stages of science
5179000	5182000	and technological development at NETL,
5182000	5185000	which could lead to commercially viable solutions in the energy area,
5185000	5188000	specific technical services areas to be performed
5188000	5191000	include R&D technology planning and analysis,
5191000	5195000	R&D operations, process engineering design and analysis,
5195000	5199000	computational research simulation and visualization,
5199000	5201000	environment safety and health assurance,
5201000	5203000	and partnership development, end quote.
5203000	5208000	Of course, NETL has no direct connection we can see to UFO legacy programs,
5208000	5213000	but it is interesting that NETL does have connections to three companies
5213000	5218000	ranging from possibly to almost certainly involved in UFO legacy programs.
5218000	5223000	Outside of RDS, SAIC engaged in multiple projects with EG&G,
5223000	5228000	as well as other contractors I suspect engage in UFO exploitation programs,
5228000	5232000	such as L3Harris and Alien Science and Technology,
5232000	5238000	as demonstrated in this 2005 250 million joint war fighting center support contract.
5238000	5242000	If Alien Science and Technology sits on the tip of your tongue,
5242000	5246000	that very well may be because this is a contractor mentioned alongside
5246000	5248000	the testimony of witness Ed.
5248000	5251000	Ed served as a director for an electronics warfare group
5251000	5253000	out of the Edwards 412th Test Wing,
5253000	5256000	which is a major range and test facility base,
5256000	5259000	and claimed to work directly with scientists and test pilots
5259000	5262000	of reverse engineered UFO vehicles.
5262000	5267000	According to Ed, this program operated across the Nevada test and training range,
5267000	5270000	as well as the Edwards 412th Test Wing,
5270000	5274000	Edwards Air Force Base, Nellis Air Force Base, Area 51, S4,
5274000	5276000	and underground connective tissue.
5276000	5278000	After his very real time at Edwards,
5278000	5280000	Ed went on to work at the Pentagon
5280000	5284000	for USAF Research Development Test and Evaluation Panel chain,
5284000	5287000	where he claimed dozens of billions of dollars went missing each year
5287000	5291000	in non-TOA or non-transfer of authority funds.
5291000	5293000	During his time at the Pentagon,
5293000	5297000	Ed also joined Alien Science and Technologies in Crystal City, Virginia
5297000	5300000	as an F-35 subject matter expert.
5300000	5304000	I have also guest with the enormous bloated budget of the F-35 program
5304000	5306000	around $2 trillion,
5306000	5311000	this aircraft platform may hide funds for UFO program operations.
5311000	5315000	In a similar venture to RDS LLC by SAIC and EG&G,
5315000	5319000	and Triad National Security LLC under Battelle,
5319000	5323000	in 1999, the same year Northrop Grumman purchased Teledyne Ryan
5323000	5327000	and was engaged in a purchasing spree I have connected to UFO programs,
5327000	5332000	SAIC and Northrop entered a joint venture to create AMSEC LLC.
5332000	5336000	AMSEC grew from $100 million in revenue in 2000
5336000	5339000	to $500 million in revenue by 2007.
5339000	5340000	Quote,
5340000	5343000	AMSEC contracts primarily with the Navy
5343000	5346000	are expected to gross $500 million next year.
5346000	5349000	AMSEC is jointly owned by Newport News Shipbuilding,
5349000	5351000	a division of Northrop Grumman,
5351000	5354000	and Science Applications International Corporation.
5354000	5355000	End quote.
5355000	5359000	AMSEC specializes in providing naval architecture and marine engineering,
5359000	5362000	naval ship systems assessments, maintenance engineering,
5362000	5365000	waterfront maintenance support, acquisition program support,
5365000	5367000	shipyard industrial engineering,
5367000	5371000	and C4I installation and support services.
5371000	5375000	AMSEC also provides lifecycle integrated logistics services,
5375000	5377000	including technical manual development,
5377000	5380000	provisioning documentation, spare parts management,
5380000	5383000	training development and delivery, and software development.
5383000	5387000	By the 2010s, AMSEC operated as a major contractor
5387000	5389000	providing engineering and technical services
5389000	5392000	in support of the Navy modernization program.
5392000	5398000	Some AMSEC, IDIQ, or indefinite delivery and definite quantity contracts.
5398000	5402000	A contracting method, David Grush has stated support legacy program funding
5402000	5405000	saw 2015 contracts north of $83 million
5405000	5408000	for Naval Surface Warfare Centers for AMSEC.
5408000	5411000	Consider me intrigued here, as I have previously discussed,
5411000	5413000	and as we will discuss later,
5413000	5416000	the testimony of Randy Anderson and SAIC
5416000	5418000	running the Off-World Technologies Division
5418000	5422000	below NSWC Crane in 2012 to 2015.
5427000	5430000	In my projects, when discussing DOD contractors,
5430000	5432000	FFRDCs, and new arcs,
5432000	5435000	I try and single out official reports, internal reports,
5435000	5438000	defense technical intelligence center documents, etc.
5438000	5442000	to attempt to draw parallels to UFO legacy programs.
5442000	5446000	Previous references have included project updates on Project Stork
5446000	5449000	and metallurgical alloy analysis by Battelle.
5449000	5452000	TRW's work on high-speed underground tunnels
5452000	5455000	possibly connecting deep underground military bases.
5455000	5458000	1972's Project Outgrowth
5458000	5461000	out of the US Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory
5461000	5464000	at Edwards Air Force Base detailing anti-gravity propulsion
5464000	5467000	and many, many, many more.
5467000	5470000	Of course, seen as it's our subject today,
5470000	5474000	SAIC has their own compelling historical documentation.
5474000	5478000	In 1988, SAIC began work on a report titled
5478000	5481000	Electric Propulsion Study for Edwards Air Force Base's
5481000	5484000	Aeronautics Laboratory in the Air Force Base Technology Center,
5484000	5486000	AFSC.
5486000	5489000	As we've discussed throughout today, viewers of my channel
5489000	5492000	will recall my extremely high conviction regarding a joint
5492000	5495000	UFO-ARV Alien Reproduction Vehicle Program
5495000	5498000	existing between Edwards Air Force Base
5498000	5500000	and the Nevada Test and Training Range.
5500000	5503000	Again, this was covered in great detail on my video on Ed,
5503000	5506000	an electronics warfare test director out of Edwards
5506000	5508000	who claimed to operate this program
5508000	5511000	engaging with UFO legacy program scientists
5511000	5513000	and ARV pilots.
5513000	5517000	This 1988 SAIC document, released August of 1990,
5517000	5521000	was written by SAIC investigator Dennis Cravens
5521000	5523000	and featured extensive contribution
5523000	5526000	from Assistant Director of Los Alamos National Labs
5526000	5528000	Center for Explosive Technology Research,
5528000	5530000	Ferris Williams.
5530000	5533000	This paper discusses the byfield-brown effect.
5533000	5536000	Los Alamos National Labs and Lawrence Livermore National Labs
5536000	5539000	work on highly classified power density devices
5539000	5541000	for the Strategic Defense Initiative
5541000	5544000	and ultimately suggests a five-dimensional approach
5544000	5548000	to unifications of fields for novel propulsion methods.
5548000	5551000	The report also suggests anti-gravity could be achieved
5551000	5554000	by using rotating cylinders filled with mercury
5554000	5559000	and should be considered for oceanic and atmospheric applications.
5559000	5562000	Intriguing to say the least, as this rotating mercury system
5562000	5564000	is the exact propulsion method,
5564000	5567000	USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet claimed originated
5567000	5569000	from reverse engineering out of Sandia
5569000	5571000	in Lawrence Livermore National Labs
5571000	5575000	that powered the TR-3B Alien Reproduction Vehicle.
5575000	5577000	The circular plasma-filled accelerator ring
5577000	5579000	called the Magnetic Field Disruptor
5579000	5581000	surrounds a rotatable crew compartment.
5581000	5583000	It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined
5583000	5585000	as far as technology.
5585000	5587000	Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed
5587000	5590000	a reverse-engineered MFD
5590000	5592000	and I believe the government will go at any lengths
5592000	5594000	to protect this technology.
5594000	5596000	But you're not going to be able to build one of these
5596000	5599000	from what I tell you, nor am I.
5599000	5601000	The government will go to any lengths.
5601000	5604000	Believe me, the plasma in this accelerator
5604000	5606000	is mercury-based.
5606000	5609000	It's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres
5609000	5611000	at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin,
5611000	5613000	superconductivity,
5613000	5616000	and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute
5616000	5618000	to create a superconductive plasma
5618000	5621000	with a resulting gravity energy.
5621000	5625000	The MFD generates a magnetic vortex field
5625000	5628000	which disrupts and neutralizes the effects of gravity on mass
5628000	5631000	within proximity by 89%.
5631000	5634000	Do not misunderstand, this is not anti-gravity.
5634000	5637000	Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force.
5637000	5639000	Just for consideration,
5639000	5641000	it is also interesting how this Ferris-Williams,
5641000	5643000	mentioned in this report,
5643000	5647000	also spoke at a June 2001 UFO Technology Conference
5647000	5649000	where it was mentioned his research was sponsored
5649000	5651000	by Hal Putoff.
5651000	5654000	This conference was actually held in La Jolla, San Diego
5654000	5657000	with immediate proximity to numerous SAIC locations
5657000	5659000	and their California headquarters.
5659000	5661000	In July of 2018,
5661000	5665000	journalist George Knapp released a leaked version of 38 DIRDS,
5665000	5667000	or Defense Intelligence Reference Documents
5667000	5671000	created under the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program,
5671000	5672000	or ATIP.
5672000	5675000	ATIP, of course, is the controversial office
5675000	5678000	Lou Elizondo claimed to direct, work for,
5678000	5680000	or operate under in various capacities.
5680000	5682000	Much discussion has been conducted
5682000	5684000	surrounding ATIP versus ASAP,
5684000	5688000	the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program.
5688000	5691000	This is of course not the subject of today's video,
5691000	5694000	and while I maintain ATIP was likely a white world cover
5694000	5697000	for more classified programs under ASAP,
5697000	5699000	we will not be discussing the complexities
5699000	5701000	of ATIP versus ASAP today.
5701000	5704000	On 16 January 2019,
5704000	5706000	the Black Vault received a list of the aforementioned
5706000	5708000	DIRD reports under FOIA.
5708000	5710000	By March 2022,
5710000	5712000	the Black Vault had successfully received copies
5712000	5714000	of all 38 DIRD reports.
5714000	5717000	I have discussed these DIRDS before.
5717000	5719000	The subject matter and topics of them
5719000	5721000	are simply astounding.
5721000	5723000	The DIRDS feature highly scientific
5723000	5725000	and technical reports by various authors
5725000	5727000	that touch on multiple core positions
5727000	5730000	from spatial slash temporal translation
5730000	5732000	to armament.
5732000	5734000	Some of these DIRDS include focus on
5734000	5736000	space-time metric engineering by Hal Putoff,
5736000	5739000	brain-machine interfaces by Dr. R. Genick,
5739000	5741000	pulsed high-power microwave weaponry
5741000	5743000	by Dr. James Wells,
5743000	5745000	and advanced aerospace configurations
5745000	5747000	by Dr. Paul Sizz.
5747000	5749000	And it is interesting how in 2001,
5749000	5751000	Dr. Sizz appeared as a whistleblower
5751000	5754000	on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document.
5754000	5756000	In his tape testimony to Greer,
5756000	5758000	Sizz discussed his eight years in the Air Force
5758000	5760000	at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
5760000	5762000	and 30 years working for the McDonald-Douglas
5762000	5764000	aircraft company.
5764000	5766000	Sizz discussed its involvement tracking UFOs
5766000	5768000	while at Wright-Patterson,
5768000	5770000	clocked at 20,000 miles per hour,
5770000	5773000	performing unusual and silent maneuvers,
5773000	5775000	as well as his time in classified projects
5775000	5777000	at McDonald-Douglas.
5777000	5779000	Within these DIRDS are numerous papers
5779000	5782000	written by the infamous Dr. Eric Davis,
5782000	5785000	covering such topics as traversable wormholes,
5785000	5787000	stargates, and negative energy,
5787000	5789000	anti-gravity for aerospace applications,
5789000	5791000	and concepts for extracting energy
5791000	5793000	from the quantum vacuum.
5793000	5795000	In a similar vein to these exotic DIRDS,
5795000	5798000	Davis had previously written a mind-boggling report
5798000	5801000	from 2001 to 2003,
5801000	5804000	titled Teleportation Physics Study.
5804000	5806000	If you are somehow unfamiliar with Davis,
5806000	5809000	please check out my project on the Wilson Davis Notes
5809000	5812000	or my interview with Davis on Jesse Michael's channel.
5812000	5814000	Davis wrote teleportation physics study
5814000	5816000	for the Air Force Research Laboratory,
5816000	5819000	AFRL, for Air Force Material Command
5819000	5821000	at Edwards Air Force Base.
5821000	5823000	Davis would go on to work at AFRL
5823000	5826000	and would state during the Seoul 2024 Symposium,
5826000	5829000	AFRL was where he uncovered irrefutable evidence
5829000	5832000	of UFO legacy program operations.
5832000	5834000	Teleportation Physics Study devotes
5834000	5837000	an entire report section to p-teleportation,
5837000	5839000	a form of psychokinesis, quote,
5839000	5841000	similar to telekinesis,
5841000	5844000	but generally used to designate the movement of objects
5844000	5847000	through other physical objects over great distances.
5847000	5850000	Telekinesis is a form of p-k,
5850000	5853000	which describes the movement of stationary objects
5853000	5856000	without the use of any known physical force,
5856000	5859000	and p-k is essentially the direct influence
5859000	5862000	of mind-on-matter without any known
5862000	5865000	immediate physical energy or instrumentation, end quote.
5865000	5868000	This p-k phenomenon, p-teleportation section,
5868000	5870000	stated much of the theoretical
5870000	5873000	slash experimental slash operational work on the subject
5873000	5875000	was based off a little known program
5875000	5878000	conducted at SRI International with the NSA.
5878000	5881000	Sponsored at times by the CIA, DIA,
5881000	5883000	and US Army INSCOM
5883000	5886000	that would later relocate to SAIC.
5886000	5889000	This was the infamous remote viewing program,
5889000	5891000	a.k.a. Project Stargate.
5891000	5894000	Well, there was, like, CIA docs about consciousness
5894000	5896000	and, like, weird remote viewing stuff.
5896000	5899000	I mean, besides the Stargate program
5899000	5901000	that were released in the FOIA reading room
5901000	5903000	on CIA's website, too, that are pretty trippy.
5903000	5905000	We're like, wow, CIA's looking into
5905000	5907000	some really interesting stuff.
5907000	5910000	I mean, they're a hardcore intel agency.
5910000	5911000	What's going on there?
5911000	5913000	But it makes sense that they would kind of
5913000	5915000	have to find out if that's p-k.
5915000	5917000	Like, you can't ignore that
5917000	5919000	if you're really doing your job.
5919000	5920000	If your job is intelligence.
5920000	5922000	Like, okay, like, let's look at this.
5922000	5924000	What's an aspect of the phenomenon,
5924000	5926000	because it's like a reach out from
5926000	5928000	the crash retrieval program, like, hey,
5928000	5930000	I need you to look into some weird stuff,
5930000	5932000	because it might be the key unlock
5932000	5934000	for something that we got in a warehouse, you know?
5934000	5935000	Yeah.
5935000	5937000	I speak often on the possibility
5937000	5939000	some non-human vehicles are controlled
5939000	5941000	not with complex control surfaces,
5941000	5944000	but instead with thoughts or cognition.
5944000	5946000	These sentiments have largely and recently
5946000	5948000	been associated with Jake Barber
5948000	5950000	and the discussion of psionics
5950000	5952000	and programs focused on utilizing
5952000	5954000	anomalous cognition to lure in UFO
5954000	5957000	to shoot them down with EMP weaponry.
5957000	5960000	And we came to a conclusion even in those days
5960000	5963000	that the reason most flying saucers have failed
5963000	5966000	is because our conclusion was that this being
5966000	5968000	is part of the guidance system.
5968000	5969000	He's part of that saucer.
5969000	5971000	But as we just saw,
5971000	5974000	discussion of UFOs and cognition far predate Barber.
5974000	5977000	The late Colonel Philip J. Corso would claim
5977000	5979000	he and the Army's Foreign Technology Division
5979000	5982000	under Arthur Trudeau were in the early 1960s,
5982000	5985000	tasked with numerous projects for the purpose
5985000	5987000	of seeding and adapting technologies
5987000	5989000	plucked from UFO crash retrievals,
5989000	5992000	specifically Roswell, into the U.S. military
5992000	5994000	industry, if possible.
5994000	5996000	One such project, started in 1961,
5996000	5998000	was focused on, quote,
5998000	6000000	control guidance by brainwaves, end quote.
6000000	6003000	Corso had learned from official Roswell files
6003000	6005000	the biologics on board the crash disk
6005000	6007000	were part of the guidance system.
6007000	6009000	The Foreign Technology Division sought to
6009000	6011000	adapt this technology to allow humans
6011000	6014000	to control ballistic missiles via brainwaves.
6014000	6017000	I've just had one of the most senior scientists
6017000	6020000	in the U.S. Defense Department's former
6020000	6023000	admitted to me that he was read into
6023000	6026000	a UFO crash retrieval program.
6026000	6030000	I've spoken to well over 20 people now.
6030000	6035000	What I was told consistently was
6035000	6038000	the technology is mind-blowing,
6038000	6041000	and they are not in a position
6041000	6045000	to be able to engineer it yet,
6045000	6047000	because it's just light years
6047000	6050000	beyond what we have.
6050000	6052000	It's a completely new type of physics,
6052000	6055000	is what one person said to me.
6055000	6057000	And you might be interested in this, Jay,
6057000	6062000	because of the sort of direction
6062000	6064000	that your interests have taken.
6064000	6067000	Without expanding on it,
6067000	6069000	one of the people I spoke to told me
6069000	6072000	that it had a lot to do with
6072000	6075000	a mind-interface connection with the engineering
6075000	6077000	that it was driven by some kind of consciousness
6077000	6081000	or some kind of intelligent connection
6081000	6086000	with machinery that was beyond our understanding.
6086000	6088000	Indeed, similar claims can be found
6088000	6090000	within the files of the late legendary
6090000	6091000	Leonard Stringfield.
6091000	6093000	Analyzing Stringfield's notes
6093000	6095000	reveals a conversation with one Mr. Hines,
6095000	6097000	who had a source from Bell Labs.
6097000	6099000	Of course, Bell Labs I've discussed before,
6099000	6103000	as having involvement in UFO legacy programs.
6103000	6105000	Lenn spoke to a Mr. Hines,
6105000	6107000	who had a source from Bell Labs.
6107000	6109000	The informants stated that he was on the flight line
6109000	6113000	at a California Air Force Base in the early 1950s,
6113000	6115000	and saw a UFO retrieval brought in.
6115000	6118000	He allegedly saw a cutaway of the recovered craft,
6118000	6121000	plus the headband transceiver worn by the aliens.
6121000	6123000	Anyone involved with the retrieval
6123000	6125000	was subject to intense scrutiny and search.
6125000	6128000	Apparently, one man must have kept a part of the craft,
6128000	6130000	and he mysteriously disappeared.
6130000	6132000	He was never seen again.
6132000	6135000	What I can tell you is that people who work on this technology
6135000	6137000	tell me it has no control systems,
6137000	6139000	no control surfaces,
6139000	6143000	no visible propulsion system,
6143000	6146000	no dials, no levers, no buttons.
6146000	6150000	It's a shell.
6150000	6154000	They tell me it's operated by consciousness.
6154000	6156000	Go figure.
6156000	6159000	When analyzing USG's special access programs
6159000	6161000	focused on anomalous mental phenomena,
6161000	6164000	being moved into the secrecy of the corporate world,
6164000	6166000	I can't help but to think of direct parallels
6166000	6168000	to UFO legacy programs.
6168000	6171000	Acknowledged US programs into anomalous cognition
6171000	6174000	began in 1977 with Project Stargate.
6174000	6177000	Project Stargate was a joint secret army,
6177000	6181000	DIA, CIA, and SRI International Contractor Program
6181000	6183000	tasked to investigate the potential
6183000	6186000	for military use of psychic phenomena.
6186000	6188000	The program went by many codenames
6188000	6191000	based on operational agencies within the program.
6191000	6193000	Gondola Wish, Stargate,
6193000	6195000	Sunstreak for the CIA,
6195000	6196000	Grille Flame for INSCOM,
6196000	6198000	Center Lane for the DIA, etc.
6198000	6200000	This was until 1991
6200000	6203000	when the project would consolidate under the Stargate project
6203000	6207000	and be moved to our subject of today, SAIC.
6207000	6210000	Stargate was initially operated out of Fort Meade, Maryland
6210000	6212000	with a key sponsor of the work
6212000	6214000	being Major General Albert Stubblebine.
6214000	6217000	Stubblebine founded US Army Intelligence
6217000	6219000	and Security Command INSCOM.
6219000	6222000	INSCOM initially commanded the US Special Forces Unit,
6222000	6225000	the ISA, Intelligence Support Activity.
6225000	6228000	The ISA was later on moved to JSOC,
6228000	6230000	Joint Special Operations Command,
6230000	6232000	where I and others like Chris Sharp
6232000	6234000	have accused JSOC elements of participating
6234000	6236000	in foreign UFO crash retrievals
6236000	6239000	alongside the CIA Office of Global Access.
6239000	6242000	Stubblebine himself has been accused by numerous individuals
6242000	6245000	such as Philip J. Corso and Stephen Greer
6245000	6249000	of participating directly in UFO material exploitation programs
6249000	6253000	at Fort Wachuka, funding clandestine men-in-black type entities
6253000	6254000	and much more.
6254000	6256000	Stubblebine, according to Greer,
6256000	6259000	is the man who offered Greer $2 billion
6259000	6262000	to absorb Greer's organization, C-SETI,
6262000	6263000	into the general's work.
6263000	6265000	So it is quite intriguing,
6265000	6268000	a general with keen aptitude for anomalous cognition
6268000	6270000	would also be accused of participating
6270000	6273000	in UFO legacy program operations.
6273000	6276000	This reminds me of the quote we just heard from David Grush,
6276000	6279000	but let's focus our work back to SAIC.
6279000	6283000	SAIC would continue Stargate from 1991 to 1994.
6283000	6288000	However, I would wager this work continued long after 1994.
6288000	6290000	SAIC published 10 primary studies
6290000	6293000	focused on remote viewing and sci phenomena.
6293000	6296000	SAIC would coin the terms anomalous cognition,
6296000	6299000	also known as remote viewing or clairvoyance,
6299000	6301000	a quote, form of information transfer
6301000	6304000	in which all known sensorial stimuli are absent.
6304000	6308000	That is, some individuals are able to gain access to information
6308000	6311000	by an as yet unknown process, end quote.
6311000	6313000	As well as anomalous perturbation,
6313000	6316000	aka psychokinesis, a quote,
6316000	6318000	form of interaction with matter
6318000	6320000	in which all known physical mechanisms are absent.
6320000	6323000	That is, some individuals are able to influence matter
6323000	6326000	by an as yet unknown process, end quote.
6326000	6328000	In their official reports,
6328000	6331000	SAIC stated they were and earlier programs
6331000	6335000	were able to verify the existence of anomalous cognition
6335000	6339000	but not able to verify the existence of anomalous perturbation.
6339000	6342000	SAIC would employ agents and beacons for such experiments.
6342000	6345000	Agents displayed a quantitative measurement of displays
6345000	6348000	of anomalous cognition and beacons served as individuals
6348000	6351000	who would engage in direct sensorial stimuli
6351000	6353000	from an intended target to act
6353000	6357000	as a focus of attention for the anomalous cognition receiver.
6357000	6359000	Some pretty incredible stuff I know,
6359000	6361000	and as I have stated before on numerous occasions,
6361000	6364000	I am still myself learning about PSY phenomena
6364000	6366000	in relation to the subject of UFOs.
6366000	6370000	So for now, we will leave SAIC's work into AC and AP,
6370000	6373000	but perhaps we will revisit the subject in the future.
6373000	6376000	But SAIC's possible hidden continuation of Stargate
6376000	6380000	does tie into the last subject we will discuss today.
6381000	6387000	Naval Support Activity Crane,
6387000	6390000	home to one of the nation's most important military laboratories,
6390000	6394000	is sometimes referred to as the Pentagon's best kept secret,
6394000	6397000	Senator Joe Donnelly, Indiana.
6397000	6399000	As I mentioned at the beginning of this video,
6399000	6401000	I have covered the case of Randy Anderson
6401000	6403000	in the Off-World Technologies Division
6403000	6406000	underneath NSWC Crane before.
6406000	6408000	This early investigation was taken down
6408000	6411000	to support Randy's testimony reaching a wider audience
6411000	6413000	on Jesse Michael's platform.
6413000	6415000	With this investigation into SAIC,
6415000	6417000	I thought it prudent to make my investigation
6417000	6420000	into Randy Anderson available again.
6420000	6423000	This is because the overwhelming majority of that investigation
6423000	6427000	was labeling with high confidence SAIC
6427000	6429000	as the contractor in question in charge
6429000	6432000	of a secret division housing recovered technology.
6432000	6435000	So for the full picture, I recommend watching my video
6435000	6437000	to learn more about the data investigation,
6437000	6439000	contractors, military units,
6439000	6441000	and more associated with Randy's story
6441000	6443000	and to hear more from Randy overall,
6443000	6446000	I highly recommend viewing Jesse's video.
6446000	6448000	But let's briefly summarize Randy's experience
6448000	6450000	and tie it into SAIC.
6450000	6452000	In the early to mid-2010s,
6452000	6455000	Randy was sent to the Naval Surface Warfare Center
6455000	6458000	in Crane, Indiana for advanced weapons training.
6458000	6460000	Anderson served as a US Army Green Beret,
6460000	6462000	18 Bravo weapons sergeant,
6462000	6465000	which meant the soldier was a highly trained expert
6465000	6469000	in US and foreign small arms weaponry and explosives.
6469000	6471000	Anderson and his fellow Green Berets
6471000	6474000	were sent to Crane for weapons testing and training courses.
6474000	6476000	However, due to holding a TSSCI clearance,
6476000	6478000	Anderson and one other soldier
6478000	6482000	were shown classified foreign and domestic weapon platforms.
6482000	6484000	These included disruptive technologies
6484000	6486000	such as unique Russian ballistics.
6486000	6488000	But quickly, what is Crane?
6488000	6491000	The Naval Surface Warfare Center, or NSWC,
6491000	6494000	is part of the Naval Support Activity Crane
6494000	6497000	alongside the US Army Ammunition Activity,
6497000	6500000	which stockpiles much of the US mainland's munitions.
6500000	6503000	Crane, Indiana was chosen for these stockpile duties
6503000	6506000	during World War II, as such a landlocked state
6506000	6508000	would have proved to have been difficult
6508000	6510000	to be targeted by enemy forces.
6510000	6513000	NSWC Crane is a massive facility,
6513000	6515000	with several underground layers highlighted
6515000	6517000	as the Premier Navy Lab,
6517000	6519000	whose mission is to quote,
6519000	6522000	provide acquisition and in-service engineering
6522000	6525000	and technical support for sensors, electronics,
6525000	6528000	electronic warfare, and special warfare weapons,
6528000	6529000	end quote.
6529000	6531000	Operations at Crane are divided into
6531000	6533000	three distinct focus areas,
6533000	6535000	strategic missions, electronic warfare,
6535000	6537000	and expeditionary warfare.
6537000	6540000	But this location doesn't focus on conventional missions.
6540000	6542000	As we see from this recent Duke University
6542000	6545000	long-range broad agency announcement,
6545000	6547000	a key focus of Crane's programs
6547000	6550000	is advanced concepts and technologies,
6550000	6551000	end quote.
6551000	6553000	And we discussed some of these advanced concepts
6553000	6555000	and technologies earlier in this project
6555000	6558000	with mention of SAIC and the JTAA.
6558000	6560000	The underground presence of the base
6560000	6562000	is key to mention here.
6562000	6564000	Not only are there numerous underground bunkers
6564000	6566000	for munitions storage hidden below the ground,
6566000	6569000	but also small arms testing resources,
6569000	6572000	such as an underground 100 meter firing range.
6572000	6574000	Now as I mentioned earlier,
6574000	6576000	I'm here at Crane to test advanced foreign
6576000	6578000	and domestic weaponry.
6578000	6580000	The Crane facility has historically worked closely
6580000	6582000	with the U.S. Army for weapons testing,
6582000	6584000	training, and defensive capabilities,
6584000	6588000	such as countering improvised explosive devices in Iraq.
6588000	6592000	And the NSWC is no stranger to reverse engineering,
6592000	6595000	critical technology to maintain quote unquote
6595000	6598000	fleet readiness, such as an intriguing black box
6598000	6602000	I covered extensively in my first video on Randy Anderson.
6602000	6605000	Best of my knowledge, NSWC Crane is integral
6605000	6608000	to naval UFO legacy programs.
6608000	6613000	Previously, not only did I tie intriguing NSWC Crane contracts
6613000	6616000	to work done on UFO underwater recovery programs
6616000	6619000	operating out of the Navy alongside Woods Hole
6619000	6622000	Oceanographic Institute and U.S. intelligence agencies,
6622000	6626000	such as the NRO and the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office,
6626000	6629000	but let's also mention that NSWC Crane
6629000	6632000	likely resides in a complex system of naval centers
6632000	6636000	engaged in T-U-O technologies of unknown origin,
6636000	6638000	housing, and exploitation.
6638000	6640000	I know I say this all the time,
6640000	6642000	but this really is another video for another day,
6642000	6645000	as I am still deeply engaged with this research.
6645000	6648000	The thesis I am building here, however, is this.
6648000	6650000	Naval undersea warfare center divisions,
6650000	6653000	such as Keyport, and university affiliated research centers,
6653000	6655000	such as the Applied Research Laboratory
6655000	6657000	at the University of Hawaii at Manoa,
6657000	6659000	engage with UFO data.
6659000	6662000	Naval surface warfare centers, such as Crane,
6662000	6664000	engage with T-U-O hardware.
6664000	6668000	And nav-air installations like China Lake and Patuxent River
6668000	6670000	deal with quote-unquote aircraft.
6670000	6672000	This really will be a worthy thread.
6672000	6675000	We will pull on a bit now and more in the future
6675000	6679000	that quite likely has SAIC written all over it.
6679000	6681000	On 5 June 2025,
6681000	6684000	Immaculate Constellation whistleblower Matthew Brown
6684000	6686000	illustrated an enormously impactful tweet
6686000	6689000	that directly referenced UFO materials or craft
6689000	6693000	being stored at the Patuxent River special project hangars
6693000	6696000	that are owned by the Imentum Corporation
6696000	6699000	amongst quote-unquote other fun spaces.
6699000	6701000	Of course, alongside Imentum,
6701000	6703000	SAIC has a significant presence
6703000	6705000	at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River,
6705000	6709000	enjoying similarly lucrative contracts to NSWC Crane
6709000	6711000	while majorly supporting PAX River's
6711000	6713000	Naval Air Warfare Center aircraft division
6713000	6716000	and ship and air integration warfare division.
6716000	6718000	Remember how earlier in this project
6718000	6722000	we discussed joint ventures with SAIC and EGNG
6722000	6724000	and SAIC in Northrop,
6724000	6727000	possibly linked to UFO legacy programs?
6727000	6731000	Well, SAIC has engaged in similar practices with Imentum.
6731000	6733000	A contractor Matt Brown has now accused
6733000	6737000	of housing UFO materials at Nav Air PAX River.
6737000	6740000	SAIC and Imentum join forces to form FSA,
6740000	6743000	a contractor that as recently as 2020
6743000	6746000	has secured IDIQ federal contracts
6746000	6749000	in excess of $1.3 billion.
6749000	6752000	Perhaps in the future we can shed more light
6752000	6755000	on possible joint SAIC Imentum work
6755000	6759000	on UFO legacy programs at major Naval RD-TNE stations.
6759000	6763000	Anyways, after observing prosaic disruptive technologies,
6763000	6765000	Randy and one of his fellow soldiers
6765000	6768000	were taken to a pristine and advanced location
6768000	6772000	under Crane by an unmarked contractor in civilian clothes.
6772000	6774000	Anderson was told by this guide,
6774000	6776000	a private contractor former military,
6776000	6779000	in the same individual leading the weapons training course,
6779000	6781000	quite nonchalantly,
6781000	6783000	they were entering the quote-unquote
6783000	6785000	off-world technologies division.
6785000	6787000	Upon entering, Randy did not enter
6787000	6789000	a normal firing range or laboratory.
6789000	6791000	He and the other men entered
6791000	6794000	what seemed to be a scientific observation room
6794000	6797000	overseeing a laboratory housing two pieces of technology
6797000	6799000	staffed by one other contractor
6799000	6801000	dressed similar to a lab technician.
6801000	6804000	One device Randy witnessed was a sphere
6804000	6806000	no bigger than a basketball
6806000	6808000	that was seemingly constructed from seamless metal.
6808000	6810000	The soldiers were told by their guide
6810000	6812000	this object and the other piece of technology
6812000	6815000	interacted with human consciousness.
6815000	6817000	The other piece of technology
6817000	6819000	was seemingly similar to a type of gauntlet
6819000	6821000	that was according to the contractor
6821000	6823000	considered weapon technology
6823000	6825000	due to the tech producing an energetic discharge
6825000	6827000	during recovery.
6827000	6829000	This weapon was projecting some type of
6829000	6831000	glyphic writing Randy could not distinguish
6831000	6833000	between physical projection
6833000	6835000	or projection into his mind.
6835000	6837000	Shortly after, Randy was escorted
6837000	6839000	out of the off-world technologies division
6839000	6842000	and to this day suffers extensive mental haze
6842000	6845000	and memory problems surrounding this event.
6845000	6848000	But where does SAIC tie into this?
6848000	6850000	The mission of NSWC Crane
6850000	6852000	is to provide the quote American warfighter
6852000	6854000	with solutions to their toughest technical challenges
6854000	6856000	to better equip a decisive advantage
6856000	6858000	in electromagnetic warfare,
6858000	6861000	strategic missions and expeditionary warfare end quote.
6861000	6863000	Crane employs a whopping
6863000	6866000	2489 contracting force
6866000	6868000	and engages in projects with numerous
6868000	6870000	defense contractors, DOE labs
6870000	6873000	like Sandia National Labs and universities.
6873000	6875000	And also recall as I just mentioned
6875000	6878000	earlier in this project we have already discussed
6878000	6880000	mention of SAIC and many contracts
6880000	6882000	for the JTAA,
6882000	6884000	the Joint Technology Assessment Activity,
6884000	6886000	a key component of Crane that supports
6886000	6888000	the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense
6888000	6890000	Advanced Systems and Concepts.
6890000	6892000	SAIC, one of the DoD's
6892000	6894000	premier science and technology
6894000	6896000	subject matter experts
6896000	6898000	and innovative contractors,
6898000	6900000	aka Washington Shadow,
6900000	6902000	who has better access to the Pentagon
6902000	6904000	than the government's own attorneys,
6904000	6906000	has extensive contracts of interest
6906000	6908000	with NSWC Crane as well as a provable
6908000	6910000	previous interest in consciousness
6910000	6912000	related studies similar to the
6912000	6914000	sphere Randy observed that
6914000	6916000	reportedly only responded to human consciousness.
6916000	6918000	Indeed, right around
6918000	6920000	the time of Randy's encounter, 2012,
6920000	6922000	the Office of Naval Research
6922000	6924000	was seemingly carrying on the legacy
6924000	6926000	of SAIC and Stargate,
6926000	6928000	announcing a revolutionary research study
6928000	6930000	that investigated sixth sense
6930000	6932000	among humans to understand how to train
6932000	6934000	personnel on quote,
6934000	6936000	intuitive decision making, end quote.
6936000	6938000	But like we've been doing in this video,
6938000	6940000	let's follow the money and analyze
6940000	6942000	some contracts. In my project
6942000	6944000	on joint U.S. Navy under C-UFO
6944000	6946000	retrieval programs, I highlighted
6946000	6948000	joint programs operating between
6948000	6950000	the U.S. Navy, the Office of Naval Research,
6950000	6952000	the Office of Naval Intelligence,
6952000	6954000	U.S. Intelligence agencies such as
6954000	6956000	NRO, NRO, NGA, CIA,
6956000	6958000	as well as US SOCOM
6958000	6960000	or Special Operations Command,
6960000	6962000	Defense Contractors, and FFRDC
6962000	6964000	such as the Center for Naval Analysis,
6964000	6966000	MITRE, SAIC,
6966000	6968000	Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute,
6968000	6970000	and Premier U.S. Naval Weapons Facilities
6970000	6972000	such as NSWC Crane
6972000	6974000	and NSWC Chita Lake.
6974000	6976000	In that project, which I highly recommend
6976000	6978000	viewing, I discussed how Woods Hole
6978000	6980000	Oceanographic Institute provided
6980000	6982000	submersibles for under C-UFO crash
6982000	6984000	retrievals for their quote, unique
6984000	6986000	capabilities that cannot be otherwise
6986000	6988000	obtained, end quote. I theorized
6988000	6990000	this work was conducted through
6990000	6992000	SoulSource, IDIQ, and IDIC
6992000	6994000	engineering service contracts
6994000	6996000	between the National Defense Research and Development
6996000	6998000	Services and Woods Hole awarded
6998000	7000000	to Naval Surface Warfare Centers.
7000000	7002000	Examples can be found
7002000	7004000	between Woods Hole and Newit Keyport
7004000	7006000	for the procurement of quote, hardware,
7006000	7008000	materials, and supplies, as well as
7008000	7010000	services to develop, build, fabricate,
7010000	7012000	integrate, evaluate, and support
7012000	7014000	the unmanned undersea vehicle family
7014000	7016000	of systems for the Naval Undersea
7016000	7018000	Warfare Center, end quote.
7018000	7020000	Indeed, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute
7020000	7022000	even has historical contracts
7022000	7024000	with SAIC at NSWC Crane,
7024000	7026000	such as this 24 May
7026000	7028000	2023 contract for quote,
7028000	7030000	research and development of expeditionary
7030000	7032000	systems for Naval Sea Systems
7032000	7034000	Command, Naval Surface Warfare
7034000	7036000	Center Crane Weapon System Division
7036000	7038000	JXN, end quote.
7038000	7040000	Crane's JXN,
7040000	7042000	aka Weapon Systems Division,
7042000	7044000	falls under NSWC Crane's JX
7044000	7046000	or Special Warfare and
7046000	7048000	Expeditionary Systems Division.
7048000	7050000	This is the department I previously suspected
7050000	7052000	and still suspect holds
7052000	7054000	the Off-World Technologies Division
7054000	7056000	ran by SAIC.
7056000	7058000	Curiously, there is a 2020 contract
7058000	7060000	of interest here that was deleted
7060000	7062000	from SAIC's website.
7062000	7064000	This $133 million contract
7064000	7066000	awarded to SAIC
7066000	7068000	tasked the corporation to continue to provide
7068000	7070000	mission engineering and integration services
7070000	7072000	to the Maneuver Engagement
7072000	7074000	and Surveillance Systems Division
7074000	7076000	at NSWC Crane.
7076000	7078000	The Maneuver Surveillance and Engagement Division
7078000	7080000	JXW falls parallel
7080000	7082000	to the Weapon Systems Division JXN
7082000	7084000	that sees joint contracts between
7084000	7086000	SAIC, Woods Hole and Crane,
7086000	7088000	both of which fall under the
7088000	7090000	aforementioned Special Warfare
7090000	7092000	and Expeditionary Systems Crane Division.
7092000	7094000	In fact, analyzing this
7094000	7096000	JXW Division brings even more
7096000	7098000	intrigue. Nestled within
7098000	7100000	the Maneuver Surveillance and Engagement
7100000	7102000	branch that sees enormous contracts
7102000	7104000	with SAIC is a subset called
7104000	7106000	JXWT.
7106000	7108000	The Special Capabilities Branch
7108000	7110000	are elements of the Off-World
7110000	7112000	Technologies Division hidden within
7112000	7114000	Crane's Special Capabilities Branch.
7114000	7118000	This 2020 $133 million contract
7118000	7120000	may seem obscene, but SAIC
7120000	7122000	is no stranger to frankly
7122000	7124000	enormous contracts.
7124000	7126000	Earlier in this video, we discussed
7126000	7128000	hundreds of millions of dollars awarded
7128000	7130000	to SAIC for IT
7130000	7132000	consolidation with Sandia National
7132000	7134000	Laboratories. But how about
7134000	7136000	this 2023 contract that also
7136000	7138000	suspiciously vanished from
7138000	7140000	SAIC's website around January
7140000	7142000	of 2024, detailing
7142000	7144000	a $249 million
7144000	7146000	in definite delivery
7146000	7148000	in definite quantity, SAIC
7148000	7150000	contract to support Crane's
7150000	7152000	Weapons Division Instrumentation Platform?
7152000	7154000	These are but a handful
7154000	7156000	of SAIC Crane contracts.
7156000	7158000	Numerous more absolutely
7158000	7160000	enormous contracts exist, such as
7160000	7162000	a 2010 $351 million contract
7162000	7164000	for SAIC to provide
7164000	7166000	technical engineering services
7166000	7168000	to NSWC Crane in support
7168000	7170000	of the Joint Special Operations
7170000	7172000	Response Department which is
7172000	7174000	referencing JSOC.
7174000	7176000	And remember, we've discussed today
7176000	7178000	and as I do in almost every video
7178000	7180000	I link JSOC elements
7180000	7182000	to UFO crash retrieval.
7182000	7184000	Randy claimed the contractors
7184000	7186000	associated with the classified
7186000	7188000	prosaic weapons training took him to
7188000	7190000	the Off-World Technologies Division.
7190000	7192000	We can find even more examples
7192000	7194000	of SAIC conducting weapons
7194000	7196000	testing at Crane. In a now
7196000	7198000	restricted article that was comically
7198000	7200000	pulled after my video on Randy
7200000	7202000	Anderson, SAIC demonstrated
7202000	7204000	extensive technical work providing
7204000	7206000	expertise to improve C4 ISR
7206000	7208000	a.k.a. command
7208000	7210000	control, communications, computers,
7210000	7212000	intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
7212000	7214000	in weapon systems for the warfighter
7214000	7216000	at NSWC Crane.
7216000	7218000	So if Randy's story is true
7218000	7220000	is SAIC the contractor running
7220000	7222000	the Off-World Technologies Division?
7222000	7224000	Well there is no direct proof
7224000	7226000	but I would wager there is ample
7226000	7228000	evidence SAIC with their demonstrated
7228000	7230000	interest in sigh phenomena
7230000	7232000	engagement with assets I have accused
7232000	7234000	of participating in UFO retrieval
7234000	7236000	operations at Crane and proven
7236000	7238000	history engaging in weapons training
7238000	7240000	at Crane single out SAIC
7240000	7242000	as operating an underground
7242000	7244000	laboratory focused on the housing
7244000	7246000	containment and possible exploitation
7246000	7248000	of non human technology.
7276000	7278000	Anyways, as I said in the beginning of this video
7278000	7280000	I know for SAIC
7280000	7282000	we don't have as many direct
7282000	7284000	connections to UFO programs
7284000	7286000	specifically craft housing
7286000	7288000	and ARV production
7288000	7290000	then we do companies like Northrop
7290000	7292000	like we do Lockheed Morton
7292000	7294000	or even some of Northrop subsidiaries
7294000	7296000	TRW, BDM
7296000	7298000	all the way back to Aerospace etc
7298000	7300000	and then FFRDC's
7300000	7302000	and so on and so forth.
7302000	7304000	But I hope what I showed today
7304000	7306000	is that diving through SAIC's
7306000	7308000	corporate history
7308000	7310000	some of their larger scandals
7310000	7312000	some of their implications in UFO
7312000	7314000	programs that this company
7314000	7316000	has for lack of a better term
7316000	7318000	quite a few skeletons in its
7318000	7320000	closet. Whether this be
7320000	7322000	defrauding the United States Government
7322000	7324000	and intelligence agencies or federal
7324000	7326000	forces like virtual case file
7326000	7328000	with the FBI or
7328000	7330000	the FBI
7330000	7332000	or like project trailblazer
7332000	7334000	with the NSA
7334000	7336000	SAIC seems to
7336000	7338000	have a repeating
7338000	7340000	pattern of securing
7340000	7342000	enormous contracts
7342000	7344000	in either delivering no product
7344000	7346000	underdelivering or underdelivering
7346000	7348000	and asking for more money
7348000	7350000	and as we saw from quotes throughout
7350000	7352000	articles published by Forbes
7352000	7354000	and published by Wall Street Journal in the early 2000s
7354000	7356000	there are numerous numerous numerous
7356000	7358000	occasions on which
7358000	7360000	there are anonymous or named whistleblower
7360000	7362000	complaints against SAIC
7362000	7364000	and of course we saw this with Denise McKenzie
7364000	7366000	as well. And I was really
7366000	7368000	interested to kind of connect Aldrich Saussier
7368000	7370000	and his claims of
7370000	7372000	fraud with the SDI
7372000	7374000	the Strategic Defense Initiative and parallel
7374000	7376000	that to 1992 as well
7376000	7378000	with Denise McKenzie and SAIC
7378000	7380000	as we showed in this video
7380000	7382000	SAIC was pretty much the
7382000	7384000	largest contractor for SDI
7384000	7386000	for quite a few years
7386000	7388000	larger than other companies like Northrop Grumman
7388000	7390000	Lockheed Martin and so forth combined
7390000	7392000	so by extension
7392000	7394000	I think it is safe to assume that some of this
7394000	7396000	fraud and waste occurring in SDI
7396000	7398000	would extend to its largest
7398000	7400000	by an exponential factor
7400000	7402000	contractor
7402000	7404000	now with SAIC probably what everybody
7404000	7406000	thought going into this video was of course
7406000	7408000	Randy Aitterson the Off-World Technologies Division
7408000	7410000	and Project Stargate
7410000	7412000	now I've said
7412000	7414000	so many times and my opinion is really changing
7414000	7416000	on this matter that some of the
7416000	7418000	for lack of a better term
7418000	7420000	psionics or psychic phenomena
7420000	7422000	plural with the UFO programs
7422000	7424000	whether that be cognitively
7424000	7426000	interfacing with a craft
7426000	7428000	in terms of course those claims
7428000	7430000	and some of these beings flying
7430000	7432000	UFOs via mind or via
7432000	7434000	thoughts or headband transceivers
7434000	7436000	some of Leonard Stringfield's notes
7436000	7438000	I have really found
7438000	7440000	Solis in the quote by David Grush
7440000	7442000	on JRE
7442000	7444000	where David Grush talks about Stargate
7444000	7446000	and remote viewing documents in the CIA
7446000	7448000	reading room and other various
7448000	7450000	remote viewing programs or AC
7450000	7452000	or AP some of those
7452000	7454000	terms coined by SAIC
7454000	7456000	and I really found Solis
7456000	7458000	and Grush saying to Joe
7458000	7460000	when Joe kind of retorts back well of course
7460000	7462000	the CIA would be looking to gain every single
7462000	7464000	leverage into intelligence
7464000	7466000	gathering whether that be a legitimate source
7466000	7468000	or not that David Grush says
7468000	7470000	well maybe some of these
7470000	7472000	programs spawned out of a need
7472000	7474000	to try and unlock something we have
7474000	7476000	in a warehouse somewhere
7476000	7478000	I think that is an extremely interesting quote
7478000	7480000	and that directly kind of
7480000	7482000	corresponds to the story of Randy Anderson
7482000	7484000	in the Off World Technologies division
7484000	7486000	where some of this this sphere
7486000	7488000	that he saw was claimed to
7488000	7490000	interact with human consciousness
7490000	7492000	and how the contractors
7492000	7494000	at NSWC Crane
7494000	7496000	which is most likely and I still
7496000	7498000	maintain and I still maintain even stronger
7498000	7500000	SAIC
7500000	7502000	and I also think it's interesting
7502000	7504000	the larger SAIC connection to some of the
7504000	7506000	larger naval air stations
7506000	7508000	or naval surface warfare centers across the nation
7508000	7510000	I'm intrigued to really
7510000	7512000	dive in more about Matt Brown
7512000	7514000	statements about Patuxent
7514000	7516000	River and the Amentum hangers
7516000	7518000	and explore more of SAIC
7518000	7520000	at Patuxent River maybe NSWC
7520000	7522000	Dolgren, China Lake, etc
7522000	7524000	as well as their work with Amentum
7524000	7526000	now looking into the corporate
7526000	7528000	of SAIC I know it's
7528000	7530000	quite convoluted especially when we got
7530000	7532000	into the decision science applications
7532000	7534000	and then that long
7534000	7536000	road of DSAI going into
7536000	7538000	DSA to Stephen Myers
7538000	7540000	to L3 communications to
7540000	7542000	Engility to being bought up by SAIC
7542000	7544000	and L3 airs I know
7544000	7546000	that's crazy complicated I was
7546000	7548000	really interested to find sort of
7548000	7550000	similar to Triad National Security
7550000	7552000	with Battelle and two universities
7552000	7554000	that SAIC engaged in
7554000	7556000	similar practices and this was
7556000	7558000	with their RDS with
7558000	7560000	EG&G now of course
7560000	7562000	the LLC went defunct within a couple
7562000	7564000	years but similar to Triad
7564000	7566000	this was a crack
7566000	7568000	to break into DOE
7568000	7570000	lab work and Department of Energy
7570000	7572000	classified work but
7572000	7574000	I think one of the most tangible things we have
7574000	7576000	from today's video some of the most tangible
7576000	7578000	research is of course the SAIC
7578000	7580000	whistleblowers I
7580000	7582000	do not need to say more about
7582000	7584000	Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick
7584000	7586000	I'm sure by the time this video comes out
7586000	7588000	there will be a lot of stink about the Wall Street Journal article
7588000	7590000	and
7590000	7592000	maybe even we'll get that part too soon
7592000	7594000	so I'd like to see more of
7594000	7596000	more of basically a hero worship
7596000	7598000	tale to Sean Kirkpatrick and his great work
7598000	7600000	but I'd also like to ask
7600000	7602000	if Kona Blue was just a project
7602000	7604000	tricking all Air Force personnel
7604000	7606000	what about the circular reporting
7606000	7608000	those two seem at odds with each other from
7608000	7610000	Kirkpatrick's claims but anyway I digress
7610000	7612000	I do believe we stumbled upon some other
7612000	7614000	high-level SAIC gatekeepers
7614000	7616000	and possibly
7616000	7618000	individuals that need to be subpoenaed by Congress
7618000	7620000	of course most of these individuals are
7620000	7622000	ceased but some are still living
7622000	7624000	these gatekeeper individuals include
7624000	7626000	John M. Deutch, William J. Perry
7626000	7628000	Admiral Ray Bourne
7628000	7630000	Admiral Owens
7630000	7632000	and Donald Kerr
7632000	7634000	I'd say of all of these individuals
7634000	7636000	Donald Kerr's CV
7636000	7638000	has the greatest
7638000	7640000	greatest CV and greatest
7640000	7642000	work history that would lend to UFO legacy
7642000	7644000	programs this being CIA, DS&T
7644000	7646000	SAIC
7646000	7648000	NRO, the MITRE Corporation
7648000	7650000	etc. I'd be real interested
7650000	7652000	to hear from more about
7652000	7654000	Don Kerr's work in legacy program operations
7654000	7656000	and gosh
7656000	7658000	I'd be really interested to speak to Oki Shannon
7658000	7660000	as well of course we saw in the ATP
7660000	7662000	notes from 85 we see look to Don
7662000	7664000	Kerr for influence and money
7664000	7666000	and earlier in
7666000	7668000	those notes I didn't include this in the video
7668000	7670000	there's Don K slash
7670000	7672000	dash ET with a couple other names
7672000	7674000	now is this Don
7674000	7676000	Kerr most likely and why
7676000	7678000	ET was there other information
7678000	7680000	spoken about Don Kerr at this
7680000	7682000	advanced theoretical physics working group
7682000	7684000	at BDM's facility in McLean, Virginia
7684000	7686000	that was held one year
7686000	7688000	after Stubblebine joined BDM
7688000	7690000	I would certainly like to know more
7690000	7692000	and also I know I said
7692000	7694000	earlier in the video that I have found Denise
7694000	7696000	McKenzie in attempted to main contact
7696000	7698000	I've heard nothing yet
7698000	7700000	I'd really like to speak to her to learn more
7700000	7702000	I've also found Mr. Stuart Stanley
7702000	7704000	and I've tried to reach out to him
7704000	7706000	nothing yet either so
7706000	7708000	kind of the running theme with this video
7708000	7710000	and as we said in the beginning SAIC
7710000	7712000	has really seemed to stay in the shadows
7712000	7714000	why that is
7714000	7716000	I think they've really maintained a lower profile
7716000	7718000	than companies like Northrop Grumman
7718000	7720000	and Lockheed Martin and maintained a lower profile
7720000	7722000	than even some of the other low profile guys
7722000	7724000	like DNA, like Rand
7724000	7726000	etc
7726000	7728000	so I hope if anything this video just brings to light
7728000	7730000	some of the involvement of SAIC
7730000	7732000	and not only just do a full legacy programs
7732000	7734000	but also black budget operations
7734000	7736000	and some secretive work
7736000	7738000	I mean SAIC
7738000	7740000	from its inception
7740000	7742000	being staffed with high level individuals
7742000	7744000	such as Bobby Ray Inman has had
7744000	7746000	numerous
7746000	7748000	numerous high level intelligence and military individuals
7748000	7750000	the way this has been explained to me in the past
7750000	7752000	as some individuals who work in UFO
7752000	7754000	legacy programs within the DOD
7754000	7756000	or IC
7756000	7758000	they'll trade in their stripes and stars for a pinstripe suit
7758000	7760000	and essentially
7760000	7762000	these guys will go from working on UFO
7762000	7764000	legacy programs within official
7764000	7766000	United States government and DOD avenues
7766000	7768000	and intelligence avenues
7768000	7770000	to doing the same thing on a corporate payroll
7770000	7772000	and you'd imagine
7772000	7774000	with a lot of these gatekeepers we talked about
7774000	7776000	Sean Kirkpatrick included
7776000	7778000	a lot of these guys would either go on to work at SAIC
7778000	7780000	after
7780000	7782000	service in the U.S. DOD or IC
7782000	7784000	or before
7784000	7786000	worked in SAIC
7786000	7788000	this reminds me of John Doichu
7788000	7790000	before he joined the
7790000	7792000	joined us DepsecDef
7792000	7794000	and spearheaded SAPOC SRG
7794000	7796000	and SAPOC itself
7796000	7798000	he was already on the board of SAIC
7798000	7800000	and already working with TRW
7800000	7802000	and how about that I know in the Northrop video
7802000	7804000	we talked quite a bit about TRW
7804000	7806000	TRW was of course purchased by Lockheed Martin
7806000	7808000	in the early 2000s and
7808000	7810000	another connection to the Wilson Davis notes
7810000	7812000	TRW had also been
7812000	7814000	kind of
7814000	7816000	convicted and pursued legally for
7816000	7818000	overcharging on space
7818000	7820000	systems on space projects by the
7820000	7822000	U.S. DOD in the early 90s
7822000	7824000	and in that Northrop project I kind of
7824000	7826000	tied that together
7826000	7828000	with some of the near out auditing
7828000	7830000	that almost found out some of the
7830000	7832000	DOD UAP legacy programs
7832000	7834000	so that's interesting as well that so many of these individuals
7834000	7836000	also have connections to TRW
7836000	7838000	of course with TRW
7838000	7840000	have the old Zodiac story and so forth
7840000	7842000	by pseudonym Sedgemasters
7842000	7844000	Richard Dolan's done some incredible
7844000	7846000	work on that I'd love to work with him someday
7846000	7848000	to revisit Zodiac
7848000	7850000	but I'll leave my rant there
7850000	7852000	I do hope again that this is a springboard
7852000	7854000	for more research into
7854000	7856000	SAIC UFO legacy programs
7856000	7858000	I would like to hear more stories
7858000	7860000	of
7860000	7862000	ARV and SAIC tied together
7862000	7864000	and I would like to hear more material
7864000	7866000	exploitation programs and craft housing
7866000	7868000	because
7868000	7870000	I'm going to say this in the end of my videos every time
7870000	7872000	if you are
7872000	7874000	an individual who has had
7874000	7876000	experience first hand
7876000	7878000	or have second hand knowledge on UFO legacy programs
7878000	7880000	this be crash retrieval or material exploitation
7880000	7882000	please
7882000	7884000	email me at UAPGIRB
7884000	7886000	at protonmail.com
7886000	7888000	I've switched away from a Gmail account
7888000	7890000	I've had some wise advice that this wouldn't
7890000	7892000	necessarily be a secure method to receive such
7892000	7894000	communication so UAPGIRB
