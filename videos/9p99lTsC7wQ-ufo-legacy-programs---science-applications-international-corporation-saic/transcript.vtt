WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Before the first soldier sets foot on the battlefield,

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
before the first recon flight takes off, SAIC is there.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
Helping the Army and Air Force transform opportunities into solutions for diverse missions,

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
from mission command capabilities to enterprise IT systems,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
and modeling, simulation and training.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
We work side by side with our customers to develop field and sustain critical capabilities

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
for our nation's soldiers and airmen.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
SAIC focused on mission success.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Well, that's one of those big Pentagon contractors.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Those of us who believe there is UFO information and craft and materials stashed,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
suspect that SAIC would be one of the likely candidates to get that stuff.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
It's right in the heart of the larger conspiracy lore.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
In fact, I think that was the testimony.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
This is an alien reproduction vehicle, and just to be clear,

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
this means that it is based on advanced anti-gravity and zero-point energy propulsion systems.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Those are the propulsion systems.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
They are being manufactured by a consortium of companies that include Lockheed Martin,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Northrop, SAIC and other corporations.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
James Defense Weekly, the popular military defense publication,

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
published an article about SAIC,

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
and there's a post script to the article that anyone who believes in the science of anti-gravity

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
to be too arcane, too esoteric,

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
even for the U.S. Air Force should consider the Electric Propulsion Study

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
undertaken by SAIC for the Astronautics Laboratory, which is now part of the Phillips Lab.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
The study's primary objective was to outline physical methods

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
to test theories of inductive coupling between electromagnetic and gravitational forces

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
to determine the feasibility of such methods as they apply to space propulsion,

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
and in simplified terms, an anti-gravity propulsion system.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
It remains for some the ultimate quantum leap.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
On this channel, I have discussed numerous DOD contractors

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
and federally funded research and development centers

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
with strong ties and paper trails to UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
After all, the research conducted by myself and scores of other researchers over the decades

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
have on countless occasions directly accused the U.S. Department of Defense

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
and Intelligence community of working in tandem with defense contractors,

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
FFRDCs and UARCs to reverse engineer exotic technologies of unknown origin,

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
protected by special access and unacknowledged special access programs.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Overall, you know, the government has been the custodian of a lot of this, right,

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
and they'll hand recede it out to a clear defense contractor to do some analysis,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
which I find highly unethical.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You have basically a sole-source arrangement,

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
and you allow certain private corporate elements to look at this, develop a potential insight,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
and then sell it back to the government for profit,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
and I think that's totally unethical.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Whether this be Northrop Grumman in tales of legacy programs

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
under the Tejon radar site under Antelope Valley,

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
Lockheed Martin and accusations of constructing the TR-3B reverse-engineered alien reproduction vehicle,

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Battelle Memorial Institute and declassified studies of shape-memory alloys

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
possibly originating from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
or the Aerospace Corporation and MITRE Corporation,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
both founded between 1959 to 1960,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
allegedly to exploit technologies of unknown origin.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Much of our work on this channel is spent analyzing the private or semi-private sectors.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Today, I want to dive back into the corporate world

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
to cover an enormous DOD contractor and defense and technology corporation

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
that I believe may in fact be even more intimately entwined

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
with UFO legacy program operations and security

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
over any other American defense contractor,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Science Applications International Corporation.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Many viewing this video will recognize SAIC

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
as we will call it from here on out as a usual, tricky customer of this channel.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
No longer a piece of lost media.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
Back on 17 July 2024, long before his excellent interview on Jesse Michaels,

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
I relayed the testimony of former US Army Green Beret Randy Anderson

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
and accused SAIC as the contractor running the Off-World Technologies division

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
beneath the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane in Indiana.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Today, I'm happy to announce I will be re-releasing that investigation

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
and while I highly recommend viewing that research in its entirety,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
the first time Randy spoke publicly about his encounter,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
we will cover his story again today in brief or detail.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
The trail of SAIC and UFO legacy programs is not as clear cut and glamorous

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
as any contractor or FFRDC we have covered before on this channel.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
But by studying SAIC, I strongly believe we gain invaluable insights

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
into UFO legacy program funding, infrastructure, modus operandi, secrecy, and more.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
So for this investigation, we will break up our research into five main areas of study,

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
black-budget moneys, legacy program gatekeeping,

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
sigh research, technologies of unknown origin, and material slash craft housing.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
At the end of this investigation, we should be able to make sense of some interesting questions

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
such as, what should we make of Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick's former position

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
as senior research scientist for SAIC in 2000 pre-Aero?

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
What can we learn from former SAIC employee Denise McKinsey

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
who discussed obfuscation of funds on enormous defense contracts?

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
Why has SAIC historically conducted endless advanced propulsion and human psychic research?

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
And does SAIC really run divisions storing non-human artifacts

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
below some of the United States premier weapon centers?

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
And their involvement in UFO legacy program operations,

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
often called the NSA West, I believe SAIC and their decades of cutting edge,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
compartmentalized science and technology contracts

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
as well as intimate ties with senior DOD and intelligence community personnel,

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
highlight a contractor entrenched in UFO legacy programs at the highest level.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
SAIC is a bit of a black box.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
Much of what it does is proprietary or even top secret.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
So it's hard to tell whether what SAIC provides is necessary and effective.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
To understand SAIC and its corporate structure

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
that lends perfectly to an institution entwined with U.S. Department of Defense

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
and intelligence community deep sixth black budget special access programs,

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
we must first step back and analyze the history of SAIC.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
Science applications was born in 1969 from Dr. J. Robert Baster.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Baster served in the U.S. Navy during World War II

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
before earning his PhD in nuclear physics in 1950.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
The doctor's skills were immediately put to work

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
for the Westinghouse Atomic Power Division on the nuclear submarine program.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Baster would then join Los Alamos National Labs

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
as a research physicist before joining General Atomics

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
as the chair of the accelerator physics department.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Quote, I was not the brilliant flash of inspiration type of entrepreneur

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
and quote Baster would state,

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
rather he was more of a quote unquote persistent builder type.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Come 3 February 1969, Baster would start SAIC

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
immediately stacking the company with General Atomic Scientist

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
and created one of the first employee owned companies

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
He made it a priority to ensure that every employee owned a part of the new company

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
even using employee ownership as recruitment and retention tool.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
Staff were expected to perform superior scientific and technical work

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
while also playing a key role in the management and direction of the company.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
SAIC's internal stock ownership program

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
which promised to make government officials rich after they left public service

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
allowed Baster to immediately pack the payroll with specialist and subject matter experts

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
but also with generals, diplomats, spies and cabinet officers

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
SAIC's board and high level workforce was

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
from the company's inception staffed with high level military

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
and intelligence personnel with unprecedented access

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
to lucrative contracts and special access programs.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Quote, they had better access to the Pentagon

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
than the government's own attorneys, end quote.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
Some of these acquisitions included the illustrious Bobby Ray Inman

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Navy Admiral, NSA Director and CIA Deputy Director

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
John M. Deutsch, Under Secretary of Defense

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
under President Jimmy Carter and CIA Director

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
under President Bill Clinton

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Rear Admiral William F. Raybourne

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
who headed development of the Polaris submarine program

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
and many many many more personnel

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
We will address all of these figures and more

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
such as Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick in our SAIC gatekeepers section.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Indeed SAIC's ventures were so successful out of the gate

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
Baster's very first government contracts came from the Defense Atomic Support Agency

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
where the company was tasked with calculating the output of nuclear devices

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
By the mid-2000s SAIC achieved unrivaled success

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
in government science and technology contracting

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
specializing as Vanity Fair once said in 2007 as a quote

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Body shop in the brain business

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
It sells human beings who have a particular expertise

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Expertise about weapons, about homeland security

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
about surveillance, about computer systems

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
about information dominance and information warfare, end quote.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
By 2007 SAIC and its two major offices in San Diego, California

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
and Washington DC ballooned to the size of an entire government agency

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
featuring a workforce of over 44,000

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
larger than the manpower of the departments of labor, energy

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
and housing and urban development combined at that time

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Current day outside of their major offices

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
SAIC maintains countless locations across the continental United States

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
many of which are near U.S. military installations

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
or RDT&E facilities

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
such as the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, Indiana

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
China Lake Naval Air Station, California

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Sandia National Labs, New Mexico

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
and Crystal City, Virginia

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Similar to Northrop Grumman and their acquisition of contractors

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
such as TRW and Teledyne Ryan

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
and connections to federally funded research and development centers

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
such as the Aerospace Corporation

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
SAIC exhibits a similar, intriguing history of acquisitions, mergers

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
associations, etc.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
One such corporation, allegedly spun from SAIC

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
is DSAI Decision Science Applications Inc.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
founded in Virginia on 4 January 1977

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
DSAI operated as an employee-owned quote

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
technical services company with expertise in military command and control systems

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
commercial information management systems

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
software development, electrical engineering

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
telecommunications and physics, end quote

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
According to some previous whistleblowers

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
such as the controversial Colonel Steve Wilson

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
DSAI and SAIC were one in the same

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
with DSAI featuring a board consisting of the directors

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
of relevant UFO Black Budget divisions

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
including IBM, Lockheed, Teledyne Ryan

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Aerojet Electro Systems, etc.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Wilson would also claim Bobby Ray Inman

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
a reoccurring figure on this channel

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
and member of the board of directors of SAIC

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
also ran DSAI

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
To learn more about Wilson

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
I do recommend checking out my video on Northrop Grumman

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
and UFO Legacy Program Operations

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I will not waste much time here

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
by reviewing his whistleblower claims again

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Let's still briefly mention a handful of Wilson's claims

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
and why he is relevant to today's project

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Wilson would disclose to Dr. Richard Boylan

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
a UFO researcher with many publications

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
I approach with skepticism that he, Wilson

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
was not only stationed at Area 51 S4

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
where reverse engineered anti-gravity vehicles were tested

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
but that he also spearheaded Project Pounce

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
an elite Air Force National Reconnaissance Organization

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Special Forces Unit which retrieved downed UFOs

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
with elements of JSOC, specifically Delta Force

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Project Pounce can be observed in the disputed

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Majestic-12 Project Aquarius document

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
and, oddly enough, the 1953 Robertson Panel Report

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Remember, the Robertson Panel served as a debunking panel

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
to reduce public concern regarding UFOs

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Wilson would claim the first successful flight

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
of man-made anti-gravity alien reproduction vehicles

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
had occurred on 18 July 1971

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
which saw Admiral Bobby Ray Inman present for the test

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Inman, still at the Navy at this time

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
would go on to serve as the director of the NSA

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
deputy director of the CIA

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
vice director of the DIA

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
director of Naval Intelligence

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
and board member of SAIC in the 1980s

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Wilson's disclosures are indeed intriguing

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
but should of course be taken with some skepticism

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
therefore I do recommend also reading a more skeptical take

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
on Wilson written by Kevin Randall

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
But relevant to our discussion is Wilson's map of Star Wars City

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
an illustration depicting UFO legacy program operations

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
conducted covertly within the Strategic Defense Initiative

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
also known as SDI created in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
This SDI program will be discussed again in our project

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
in much greater detail so please hang tight

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Within this chart are numerous institutions

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
one might expect to be associated with

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
UFO retrieval and exploitation programs

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
the NRO, the National Security Council

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
the National Security Agency

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
CIA, NORAD and Majestic 12

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Adhering to the SDI Colorado HQ and Magi

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
there exists a list of contractors alleged to engage with the UFO portfolio

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
alongside the 1010 Special Security Squadron

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
which quote provides a high level of protection to NORAD, US Spacecom

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
and AF Spacecom resources located at the mountain

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
Contractors such as Rockwell, Martin Marietta, Lockheed, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and IBM are mentioned

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Wilson would state one contractor paramount to the SDI UFO programs

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
was Decision Science Applications, Inc.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
But here is where things get really interesting

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
We don't have concrete evidence

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
DSAI was spawned from SAIC though it is likely

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
However, we can analyze the evolution of DSAI

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
I would like to thank Reddit user StillChillTrill for this incredible work

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
His account is now deleted but I will still link to his excellent posts

15:31.000 --> 15:38.000
In 1998, DSAI executed a merger into a company called DSA Acquisitions, Inc.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
that was then purchased by Stephen Myers & Associates for almost $31 million in cash and stock

15:44.000 --> 15:52.000
By 21 August of that year, Stephen Myers & Associates finalized their acquisition of DSAI-DSA

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
Stephen Myers & Associates eventually acquired Emergent Information Technologies, Inc.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
and SMNA changed its name to Emergent Information Technologies

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
On 6 December 2001, Emergent Information Technologies

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
sold its Virginia-based government services group to L3 Communications

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
L3 Harris, formerly known as L3 Communications, is another defense contractor

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
that has both worked alongside SAIC for enormous defense contracts

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
and is a contractor I have been informed works directly in UFO legacy program operations

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
But to fully complete this circle, in July of 2012

16:30.000 --> 16:38.000
a part of L3 Communications aka L3 Harris spun off into its own publicly traded company called Angility

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
In 2018, SAIC purchased Angility for $2.5 billion

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
So regardless of if DSAI was spawned from SAIC

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
eventually, DSAI assets made their way to SAIC

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
and another defense contractor highly likely involved in UFO legacy operations, L3 Harris

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
But if that wasn't already difficult enough to track

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
incredibly convoluted corporate structures are commonplace with SAIC

17:04.000 --> 17:10.000
On 27 September 2013, SAIC created a $4 billion spin-off

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
retaining the name SAIC while transforming its name to LATOS

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
The primary reason for this spin-off was quote

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
conflicts of interest provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
which prevented the company from bidding on some new contracts because of existing contracts

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
end quote

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
So essentially SAIC had so many contracts and was so big

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
it had to split up to gain more

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
So just to point out, when I refer to SAIC

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
I am referring to both SAIC and LATOS

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
but this gets even more interesting

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
On 16 August 2016, LATOS merged with Lockheed Martin Information Systems

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
and Global Solutions that saw LATOS acquire this Lockheed division for $5 billion

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
And in an additional interesting event

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
on 30 November 2017, Lockheed Martin Services Inc. changed their name to LATOS Government Services Inc.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
After the creation of LATOS, SAIC announced acquisition of Skeetor Holdings

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
a defense and space manufacturing contractor with specific expertise in intelligence

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
for $790 million

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
This purchase was completed in an all-caste transaction

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
and retained the majority of original Skeetor employees

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
According to a 2008 book, Spies for Intelligence by Tim Shorok

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
Skeetor was a critical contractor for the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
for Satellite Signals Intelligence and Electronic Intelligence

18:37.000 --> 18:43.000
The CIA Directorate of Science and Technology, or DS&T, is a commonplace subject on this channel

18:43.000 --> 18:50.000
serving as a legacy UFO program office that in 2002 spawned the CIA Office of Global Access

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
Excellent journalist Chris Sharp, myself, and others have accused the Office of Global Access, or OGA

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
as participating in foreign UFO crash retrieval operations

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
I have additionally, when discussing U.S. Navy, UFO, foreign material, acquisition, and exploitation programs

19:07.000 --> 19:15.000
discussed the CIA, DS&T, alongside the NRO, Nuro, SOCOM, Department of Energy, and more

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
operating worldwide under-sea UFO retrieval operations

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
I have quite a few projects to learn more about the CIA, DS&T

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
so go check out any of these projects in the video description

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
Perhaps SAIC took note of Skeetor for their expertise in MASSINT, or Measurement and Signals Intelligence

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
a highly classified form of intelligence, quote

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
that uses infrared heat imaging, acoustic signatures, seismic data, and other information

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
picked up by air and ground sensors to sniff out for weapons tests and other activities

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
that other countries want to hide from the United States, end quote

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
MASSINT collection is primarily managed by the DIA and used extensively by the CIA

19:57.000 --> 20:07.000
In 2005, Skeetor held a national symposium on MASSINT signature technology with contractors involved such as BAE Systems and, of course, SAIC

20:07.000 --> 20:15.000
After all, according to spies for hire, quote, Skeetor may be unknown, but it is definitely not a small player, end quote

20:15.000 --> 20:25.000
Also consider me curious and possibly suspicious that Skeetor's old building in Chant Till, Virginia, 14660 Lee Road, to be specific

20:25.000 --> 20:35.000
resides in the same corporate park with SAIC, the Aerospace Corporation, an FFRDC I have accused directly as having decades of UFO program involvement

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
and the NRO

20:36.000 --> 20:44.000
SAIC's acquisitions and partnerships are indeed indicative of a contractor entwined with UFO legacy program operations

20:44.000 --> 20:50.000
Later in this project, we will explore this even further, such as SAIC's relationship with EG&G

20:50.000 --> 20:57.000
The contractor Bob Lazar claimed hired him to reverse engineer UFO propulsion systems at Area 51S4

20:57.000 --> 21:06.000
Equally intriguing as SAIC's acquisitions are the corporation's intimate ties with US intelligence and NAC for war profiteering

21:06.000 --> 21:15.000
From its inception, SAIC enjoyed high-level former intelligence officials on its board, but I would also like to reference a 2018 Baltimore Sun article titled

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
Little-known contractor has close ties with staff of NSA

21:20.000 --> 21:28.000
This article, along with the excellent book The Shadow Factory by James Bamford, detail how SAIC basically became, quote unquote,

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
A revolving door between the NSA and SAIC

21:33.000 --> 21:46.000
Interesting here as the National Security Agency or NSA is one of the US's big five intelligence agencies alongside the NRO, CIA, DIA, NGA, NRO, and likely the Hidden Neuro

21:46.000 --> 22:01.000
In numerous programs, I have implicated the NSA and UFO legacy program operations from enforcing gatekeeping in the form of treat or the tactical reconnaissance engineering assessment team to management of ARV programs such as the TR3B

22:01.000 --> 22:15.000
As a side note, an unnamed retired Army Public Affairs Officer friend of mine who brushed up against legacy programs told me he was not frightened by the CIA but was terrified of the behemoth that was the NSA

22:15.000 --> 22:23.000
And later on, we will discuss possible avenues of black-budget monies conducted between SAIC and the NSA, so hold tight

22:23.000 --> 22:31.000
Keep in mind during our investigation that SAIC is an eligible contractor under the DOD's Corporate Portfolio Program

22:31.000 --> 22:43.000
The Corporate Portfolio Program gives defense industrial-based corporations like SAIC access to DOD executives, scientists, and management with broad access to special access programs

22:43.000 --> 22:52.000
The Corporate Portfolio Program framework was established in 2020 under then US Undersecretary for Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Ellen Lord

22:52.000 --> 23:00.000
In an almost comical sequence of events, Lord would join SAIC's advisory board in July 2021

23:00.000 --> 23:09.000
And as we progress in this investigation, I find it prudent to mention SAIC is accustomed to getting their way however and whenever they want

23:09.000 --> 23:23.000
Whether this be in the form of acquisitions, enormous sole-source contracts, or war profiteering efforts, many viewers on this channel are familiar with the cries of weapons of mass destruction that fueled the logic behind the Iraq war

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
Now did you know, SAIC executives were involved at every stage of the Iraq war life cycle

23:29.000 --> 23:40.000
Indeed, quote, SAIC personnel were instrumental in pressing the case that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq in the first place, and that the war was the only way to get rid of them

23:40.000 --> 23:51.000
And when no weapons of mass destruction were found, SAIC personnel staffed the commission that was set up to investigate how American intelligence could have been so disastrously wrong

23:52.000 --> 24:02.000
Just to provide some further context here, in 1998 David Key, Weapons Expert and Director of SAIC's Center for Counterterrorism Technology and Analysis,

24:02.000 --> 24:10.000
Testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Saddam Hussein, quote, remains in power with weapons of mass destruction, end quote

24:10.000 --> 24:20.000
Following the Iraq war, President Bush appointed a commission to analyze how American intelligence managed to, quote, miss the truth about Iraq's weapons programs, end quote

24:20.000 --> 24:29.000
The commission published a report just one year later, absolving policymakers and US intelligence from distorting evidence of Iraq's WMDs

24:29.000 --> 24:44.000
The commission had direct ties to SAIC, including Gordon Uller, SAIC VP for Corporate Development, Jeffrey R. Cooper, VP for Technology and Chief Science Officer of one of SAIC's major subunits, and Samuel S. Visner

24:44.000 --> 24:51.000
SAIC VP and Director of Strategic Planning and Business Development for SAIC's Intelligence Group

24:51.000 --> 24:58.000
And now that we have finally set the stage for SAIC and UFO legacy programs, let's begin to dive in

25:02.000 --> 25:10.000
You can say categorically you've seen no convincing, confirmable evidence of intact spacecraft kept by the US government

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
No, I have seen nothing that leads me to that conclusion

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
Is it possible there is some secret program that you're just not aware of?

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
I don't think so. I have access to anything and everything I need

25:22.000 --> 25:33.000
And the way you combat conspiracy theories and the associated misunderstandings that fuel them is a fact in science and truth

25:33.000 --> 25:42.000
So if you've got evidence for conspiracy, then that helps to investigate what the underlying truth is

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
There has been none that has been substantiated for this

25:46.000 --> 25:55.000
And everything that has been brought to our attention and everything that was brought to my attention when I was in that position as the director

25:55.000 --> 26:01.000
We investigated and discovered that it did not come from where they thought it came from

26:01.000 --> 26:10.000
Most everything was explainable through other documentation, other programs, other people that had talked to other people

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
Washington Shadow, NSA West, whatever you want to call it

26:14.000 --> 26:20.000
SAIC has served as a revolving door for high level US Department of Defense personnel

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
Since the company's inception, SAIC was aggressively packed with, quote,

26:24.000 --> 26:34.000
Former generals, admirals, diplomats, spies, and cabinet officers of every kind to fill the company's board of directors and the upper echelons of its staff, end quote

26:34.000 --> 26:45.000
With such high level staff, it is no surprise there are numerous accused high level gatekeepers to UFO legacy programs with aggressive and shocking ties to SAIC

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
Let's reflect on Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, former head of the Pentagon's all-domain anomaly resolution office

26:51.000 --> 26:58.000
I certainly hold no love for Kirkpatrick, and I wait for many viewers of this channel share the same sentiment

26:58.000 --> 27:09.000
When I was in USDI, I read the transcripts of Sean Kirkpatrick briefing Senator Rubio, Senator Warren, and Senator Gillibrand on the results of his investigation in his

27:09.000 --> 27:17.000
Congressionally-tasked Arrow report, and those transcripts which were supposed to be open kimono

27:17.000 --> 27:32.000
Here's the truth, Mr. Senator, Mr. Senator, Sean Kirkpatrick, absolutely distorted, downplayed, and can't prove it, but I would say outright lied to the people who have direct responsibility for him

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
Saying what? What did he say? It was a lie

27:35.000 --> 27:47.000
So it's more of a lie of the whole big picture, the big picture, right? In the meeting it's, you know, Congressman Rubio, we've heard about this incident

27:47.000 --> 27:55.000
We just don't have enough data to go on it to really know what this is. We don't have any way of really figuring out what's going on

27:55.000 --> 28:07.000
It could just be an anomaly. In fact, it's most likely anomaly. So starting with an acknowledgement that, you know, you have some data, but we have the insight and the scientific expertise to make you feel at ease

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Nothing to see here, folks, moving on

28:09.000 --> 28:24.000
Exactly. Although there was also political discussion involved in historic discussion, and, you know, I read these transcripts once, and immediately knew that

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
Uh, yeah

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Veiled threat?

28:29.000 --> 28:40.000
No, I knew that I was now something else. I was, I had inside knowledge into the deception of our government by elements of our intelligence community

28:40.000 --> 28:49.000
Under Kirkpatrick, Arrow released the abysmal Arrow historical report volume one, which outright lied about some witness testimony

28:49.000 --> 29:02.000
This was proven, for example, by Michael Herrera's official Arrow memorandum for record, which showed Herrera did not claim to encounter an extraterrestrial spaceship or US special forces as falsely outlined in the Arrow report

29:02.000 --> 29:14.000
Arrow under the direction of Dr. Kirkpatrick additionally in 2022 engaged in DOD contracts with contractor Sand Corp, a company with a speciality in plugging whistleblower leaks

29:15.000 --> 29:34.000
I have also in the past shown ties with Kirkpatrick and his good buddy Ronald Moultrie, former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security and board member of both Battelle Memorial Institute and the Meiter Corporation and how Kirkpatrick and Moultrie enjoy debunking claims of UFOs at previous Arrow roundtables

29:34.000 --> 29:50.000
The guy that formed Arrow upon whose recommendation Arrow was formed is a guy named Ed Moultrie who is Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and he was on Battelle's board and he scrubbed that from his LinkedIn

29:50.000 --> 30:05.000
And my good friend, UAP Gerb, who is an amazing channel, he's a super deep UFO researcher, showed that it was on his resume and then he recommends that Arrow formed, it's like a total conflict of interest, it's insane, it's insane

30:05.000 --> 30:15.000
Kirkpatrick during his time at Arrow and post Arrow has frequently engaged in dismissing any and all whistleblower claims, often resorting to emotionally charged outbursts

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
You believe them?

30:16.000 --> 30:25.000
I believe that they believe what they're telling me and I, my job is not to, it's not a question of belief, right, it's a question of what can I go research

30:25.000 --> 30:36.000
There is absolutely nothing that I'm going to do say or produce evidentiary that is going to make the true believers convert, if you will

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
It's almost like a religion, it is basically a religion

30:40.000 --> 30:47.000
Myself and others have wagered Kirkpatrick served and possibly still serves as a gatekeeper for UFO legacy programs

30:47.000 --> 30:58.000
This sentiment was shared by witness Ed of the 412th Test Wing who refused to testify to Arrow under Kirkpatrick as according to Ed, Kirkpatrick is an insider meant to squash information

30:58.000 --> 31:09.000
The doctor's employment history pre and post Arrow is additionally intriguing, the good doctor has filed many patents including 2022 and 2023 patents for quote

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
System and methods for determining influence of channels in a social network, end quote

31:15.000 --> 31:24.000
But that is not our interest today, no instead it is Sean Kirkpatrick's former patents with SAIC including a 2003 filing for quote

31:24.000 --> 31:35.000
Holographic recording and micro slash nano fabrication via ultra fast holographic two photon induced photopolymerization, H-T-P-I-P, end quote

31:36.000 --> 31:49.000
Between joining the NRO and CIA in 2003 and 2005 respectively and working within the Air Force Research Laboratory in 1997, Kirkpatrick worked at SAIC as a senior research scientist

31:49.000 --> 31:55.000
We can specifically review work for SAIC as a senior research scientist in the year 2000

31:55.000 --> 32:08.000
Now how interesting is that a senior SAIC scientist went on to spearhead a questionable office in Arrow that was originally supposed to be called the UAP JPO which some have called Project Blue Book 2.0

32:08.000 --> 32:20.000
Now flashback to 1987, SAIC had previously conducted some of Sean Kirkpatrick's favorite type of science for the DOE, aspects of turbulence and non-linear solutions

32:20.000 --> 32:27.000
Shortly after leaving both the Pentagon and Arrow Kirkpatrick began his own LLC called non-linear solutions

32:27.000 --> 32:34.000
As of 1 January 2025, non-linear solutions has been subcontracted by the MITRE Corporation

32:34.000 --> 32:44.000
An FFRDC I have spoken about ad nauseum on this channel for DOD indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts for US space com

32:44.000 --> 32:57.000
The description of this MITRE contract reads, quote, award of indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for National Security Engineering Center Federally Funded Research and Development Center FFRDC, end quote

32:57.000 --> 33:14.000
The NSAC run by MITRE in McLean, Virginia operates to, quote, provide the US and its allies and partners with the ability to anticipate and solve the most consequential national security problems requiring integration across missions, capabilities, organizations, and nations, end quote

33:14.000 --> 33:31.000
I do wonder what sort of support non-linear solutions can offer as a subcontractor for MITRE under US space com here, but Kirkpatrick did have previous experience with space com, serving as the intelligence community lead for a US space com task force in 2018 to 2019

33:32.000 --> 33:44.000
Now I mention that to recall back to September 2024 when excellent researcher TAG underscore OM recovered FOIA documents from US space com dated 31 January 2023

33:44.000 --> 33:54.000
These documents outlined a briefing conducted by Kirkpatrick to high level DOD attendees on, quote, UAP response and recovery and material transfer, end quote

33:54.000 --> 34:00.000
I do sure wonder what non-linear solutions and MITRE plan to do with US space com

34:00.000 --> 34:17.000
In December 2023 Kirkpatrick also joined Oak Ridge National Laboratory as the chief technology officer for defense and intelligence programs. Oak Ridge is of course a DOE sponsored FFRDC administered by Battelle Memorial Institute

34:17.000 --> 34:29.000
These are patterns we simply cannot ignore. Why is a former SAIC senior research scientist so intimately involved with FFRDCs and UARC institutions?

34:29.000 --> 34:37.000
I commonly connect to UFO programs after his tenure as the DOD's mouthpiece to debunk UFO information with Arrow

34:37.000 --> 34:46.000
Let us now transition to the most legendary testimony of gatekeeping UFO legacy programs in history, the Wilson Davis memo

34:46.000 --> 34:56.000
So in this video in the interest of time I will assume the viewer has some knowledge of the Wilson Davis meeting notes so if you don't go check out my first ever video on this channel

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
It's a little rough but still gets the message across

34:59.000 --> 35:08.000
In short these disputed but highly likely accurate notes transcribed by Dr. Eric Davis leaked from the estate of the late astronaut Edgar Mitchell

35:08.000 --> 35:19.000
These notes recount a 2002 conversation between Davis and Vice Admiral and former DIA director Thomas Wilson outside of the parking lot of contractor EG&G in Nevada

35:19.000 --> 35:27.000
The conversation recounts Wilson finding but being stonewalled in accessing UFO recovery and material exploitation programs

35:27.000 --> 35:39.000
Protected by the DOD Special Access Program Oversight Committee, SAPOC, Senior Review Group, SRG and a large defense contractor I-Wager might in fact be SAIC

35:39.000 --> 35:49.000
According to Wilson he was informed by General Michael Ward to search a special records group in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology

35:49.000 --> 35:57.000
Belonging to special legacy holdover programs from before special access program restructuring efforts in the early 1990s

35:57.000 --> 36:05.000
In the memo UFO programs were reorganized under SAPOC SRG after an internal audit almost revealed the programs

36:05.000 --> 36:19.000
This SAPOC reorganization began on 5 January 1994 when the Deputy Secretary of Defense significantly enhanced and strengthened changes in the DOD Special Access Program SAP management and control structure

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
This newsletter on screen now highlights those changes establishing the Senior Review Group

36:24.000 --> 36:39.000
We can also possibly find some useful data. In the GAO's May 1993 report titled, quote, DOD Special Access Program's administrative due process not provided when access is denied or revoked, end quote

36:39.000 --> 36:49.000
Which discusses the Navy and Air Force not complying with DOD regulation 6200.2 slash R which discussed special access program access

36:49.000 --> 37:00.000
I did find it interesting that between the Army, Air Force, and Navy it was in fact the Army that did comply in some cases for SAP regulations according to this GAO document

37:00.000 --> 37:13.000
And according to some of my research this makes sense to me as well as I am familiar with cases in which the US Army seemed to operate UFO material exploitation programs in a strict controlled environment with oversight

37:13.000 --> 37:19.000
While Navy and Air Force legacy programs seemed to operate far more loosely and out of control

37:19.000 --> 37:32.000
But let's take a deeper look at the SAPOC in its Senior Review Group that was upon its creation by the Deputy Secretary of Defense tasked with gatekeeping UFO legacy programs according to VA DM Wilson

37:32.000 --> 37:43.000
Around the time of this restructuring, the SAPOC was chaired by Deputy Secretary of Defense the Honorable John Deutch. Mind you, John Deutch did not restructure SAPOC as DEP SECDEF

37:43.000 --> 37:49.000
This was conducted by his predecessor William Perry, but Deutch immediately followed suit in the role

37:49.000 --> 37:58.000
Immediately pre his position chairing SAPOC as the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Deutch served as the Under Secretary of Defense for acquisition and technology

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
The same office Wilson learned contained UFO legacy files

38:02.000 --> 38:13.000
Now, Deutch here is very interesting. Based upon the testimony of VA DM Wilson, we can conclude with a high degree of certainty Deutch served as a gatekeeper for UFO legacy programs

38:13.000 --> 38:20.000
Deutch served as a Director of Central Intelligence, a professor at MIT, enjoyed numerous positions within the DOE

38:20.000 --> 38:32.000
And also served as a consultant pre-work on SAPOC with TRW, Los Alamos National Labs, and MITRE, three institutions I directly accuse of being involved in UFO programs

38:32.000 --> 38:43.000
But that's not all. Pre-1995, possibly during his tenure as DEP SECDEF and within the AUSDAT, Deutch served as the Director of SAIC

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
And even worked in SAIC's La Jolla office, the same office of Denise McKenzie

38:48.000 --> 39:02.000
So, here's what we're left with. According to Wilson, the reorganization of SAPOC and creation of the senior review group directly served to gatekeeper UFO legacy programs from even a three star admiral and DIA director

39:02.000 --> 39:15.000
DEP SECDEF William J. Perry conducted such a reorganization in February of 1994 and immediately one month after a new DEP SECDEF is assigned and put in charge as chairman of SAPOC

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
This being a former SAIC director

39:18.000 --> 39:29.000
But that's not all. To put the real cherry on top here, even William J. Perry himself who reorganized SAPOC in 1994 once served on the board of SAIC

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
One could be chance, two as a pattern, so let's extend this further

39:33.000 --> 39:40.000
During his investigations, Vice Admiral Wilson spoke to two permanent members of the Special Access Program Oversight Committee

39:40.000 --> 39:49.000
Brigadier General Mike Kostanik and Paul Kaminsky, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, preceded by Deutch

39:49.000 --> 39:56.000
Kaminsky and permanent senior review group member Lynn Wells are both lifelong MITRE Corporation members, but I digress

39:56.000 --> 40:04.000
A permanent SAPOC member post-SAP restructuring is Admiral William A. Owens, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

40:04.000 --> 40:14.000
Outside of his prestigious naval career and service as senior military assistant to Dick Cheney, Owens additionally served as the CEO for SAIC

40:14.000 --> 40:26.000
All in all, the SAPOC, which was restructured in the early 1990s to serve as a gatekeeping structure for UFO legacy programs according to Wilson, saw two of six personnel as former SAIC alumni

40:26.000 --> 40:35.000
This is why I wager the contractor Wilson accused as operating alongside the SAPOC SRG for UFO secrecy is in fact SAIC

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
And let's not forget a critical third man mentioned in the Wilson Davis notes, Naval Reserve Commander Willard Miller

40:41.000 --> 40:50.000
Miller attended the 1997 meeting with VAD and Wilson and Stephen Greer, and yes, this meeting did take place, this is a fact

40:50.000 --> 40:58.000
During this meeting in the EG&G parking lot between Davis and Wilson, Davis flashed a 2002 letter addressed to him from Commander Miller

40:58.000 --> 41:04.000
Within the letter, Miller offered to aid Davis and physicist Hal Putoff in their UFO crash retrieval research

41:04.000 --> 41:13.000
Miller requested anonymity, clearly this wasn't honored, but offered to connect the men to multiple high value targets and information including

41:13.000 --> 41:23.000
A senior official with knowledge on alien reproduction vehicles, a list of civilian DOD contractors involved in UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation programs

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
In a team possibly involved with UFO crash retrievals

41:27.000 --> 41:34.000
Where did Miller get this intel? Was it first hand experience, exposure to programs or connections in the corporate world?

41:34.000 --> 41:44.000
Because Miller did after all work as a quote senior analyst in future counter threat planning, directed energy weapons, space systems and Navy space wargaming

41:45.000 --> 41:57.000
Indeed in a 2000 book called Swamp Gas Times, my two decades on the UFO beat by Patrick Hugh, emails between Commander Miller and Attorney Peter Gersten are detailed

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Miller believed quote

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
The relationship has both interest in and concern about the UFO phenomenon

42:19.000 --> 42:28.000
If there are any keepers of the keys, they reside in DOD middle management and civilian DOD contractors, BDM, SAIC, Boeing, Lockheed

42:28.000 --> 42:34.000
And the com-trollers who monitor the flow of money to certain classified and special access programs

42:34.000 --> 42:43.000
Outside of the Wilson Davis notes, there are numerous possible high level SAIC personnel serving as gatekeepers for UFO programs

42:43.000 --> 42:54.000
Discussed already today and in my previous work, we have the US Admiral, Director of the NSA, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of Neuro, Vice Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency

42:55.000 --> 43:11.000
Who went from in 1989 discussing recovered UFOs becoming available for technological research with NASA mission specialist Bob Echler to saying he found plausible answers for all UFO sightings to project unity in 2022

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
We can also take an interesting look at US Navy Admiral William F. Rayborn

43:16.000 --> 43:28.000
Alongside John Deutch and Bobby Ray Inman, Rayborn was plucked for senior SAIC roles to stack the contractors payroll with scores of influential members of the National Security Establishment

43:28.000 --> 43:42.000
Prior to his retirement from the Navy in 1963 and also prior to his positions within SAIC and the Director of National Intelligence from 1965 to 1966, Rayborn led the project to develop the Polaris missile system

43:42.000 --> 43:52.000
The Polaris program, a two-stage solid-fueled nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missile, should sound extremely familiar to some viewers of my Naval UFO Legacy Program's video

43:52.000 --> 44:03.000
A small detail, but in this video I discussed how Dr. John P. Craven, Chief Scientist of the Special Projects Office for the US Navy, spearheaded the Deep System Submergence Project

44:03.000 --> 44:10.000
and resulting deep-submergence rescue vehicles that I implicated in undersea UFO crash retrieval operations

44:10.000 --> 44:20.000
Craven himself stated the aforementioned DSSP and submersibles DSRBs were used for a tremendous amount of clandestine classified missions

44:20.000 --> 44:30.000
Craven also stated in his book The Silent War, the Deep Submergence Systems Project, which served to drastically increase the depth at which the Navy could perform undersea engineering operations

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
was created specifically to accomplish retrieval operations under Operation Sand-Dollar

44:36.000 --> 44:51.000
According to Craven's memoirs, Sand-Dollar was a clandestine highly compartmentalized project that was tasked to retrieve militarily sensitive hardware and other items of national security importance from the seafloor of the continental shelf in the deep marine environments

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
Craven wrote that this program Sand-Dollar is classified to this day, quote,

44:56.000 --> 45:04.000
I was shown an inventory itemizing the items known to be on the seabed and a map of their distribution throughout the world, end quote

45:04.000 --> 45:18.000
Outlining the complicated obfuscation of Sand-Dollar within the special access program world, Dr. Craven would state Sand-Dollar was buried within the structure of yet another secret program, itself hidden within the Polaris program

45:18.000 --> 45:33.000
Intriguing how Sand-Dollar, what eye wager was a UFO crash retrieval program, was buried under a web of programs hidden within the Polaris program, a program itself founded by Admiral Rayborn who would later on become an SAIC board member

45:33.000 --> 45:44.000
Let's finally discuss a possible gatekeeper to waived deep six UFO programs with high level ties to CIA and SAIC, Donald M. Kerr

45:44.000 --> 45:50.000
Kerr joined SAIC in 1993 as a corporate executive and vice president and director

45:50.000 --> 46:13.000
Kerr's resume includes director of Los Alamos National Labs from 79 to 85, president and director of EG&G from 89 to 92, CIA deputy director for science and technology from 01 to 05, director of the NRO from 05 to 07, and principal deputy director of national intelligence from 07 to 09

46:13.000 --> 46:26.000
Recall if you will the 1985 advanced theoretical physics working group and the notes of attendee Oki Shannon, former manager of special projects at Los Alamos and character in the Wilson Davis notes

46:26.000 --> 46:48.000
Held at the BDM Secure Facility in McLean, Virginia, this conference classified via DOE controls was supervised by the infamous Colonel John B. Alexander and held at BDM just one year after one of the primary characters of this channel, U.S. Army Inscom General Albert Stubblebine joined BDM International

46:48.000 --> 47:11.000
Oki Shannon startling notes from this conference reveal several discussions of interest for this channel, including mention of a major engineering project that existed under Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, naval information on underwater UFO hotspots near Gulfo San Matias, Argentina and mention of an organization that collects, manages and destroys UFO information

47:11.000 --> 47:26.000
Scribbled within the notes are actions Oki wished to pursue to continue a quest for cracking UFO reverse engineering programs. Towards the end of this page is a note discussing approaching Donald Kerr for influence and money.

47:26.000 --> 47:43.000
In almost every single project I do, I discuss the CIA's Office of Global Access established under the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology in 2003 to serve as a logistics coordinator harnessing the muscle of joint special operations command for foreign UFO crash retrievals.

47:43.000 --> 47:58.000
This CIA DSNT was additionally, alongside the Navy, the co-founder of Neuro, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, the U.S.'s most secret intelligence agency and one I have connected to underwater UFO crash retrievals.

47:58.000 --> 48:17.000
This Office of Global Access was actually established under the watch of Donald Kerr, former VP of SAIC in the 90s, who remember served as the deputy director of the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology from 01 to 05.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
How does a program like that get funded?

48:22.000 --> 48:31.000
I will give you generalities. I can get very specific in a closed session, but misappropriation of funds and self-fund.

48:31.000 --> 48:37.000
Does that mean that there is money in the budget that is said to go to a program but it doesn't and it goes to something else?

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Yes, I have specific knowledge of that.

48:38.000 --> 48:46.000
Do you think U.S. corporations are overcharging for certain tech they're selling to the U.S. government and that additional money is going to programs?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Correct, through something called IRAD.

48:48.000 --> 48:59.000
In 2004, Catherine Austin Fitts, former Assistant Secretary for Housing and Urban Development, released the now legendary paper titled Black Budget of the United States.

48:59.000 --> 49:05.000
Throughout the 21st century, Fitts has identified trillions of dollars spent on the U.S. black budget.

49:05.000 --> 49:15.000
Fitts has outlined 21 trillion dollars in unauthorized spending in the Departments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development from 1995 to 2015.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
Much of this money on UFO-related, quote-unquote, clandestine military R&D.

49:21.000 --> 49:34.000
Recently, Fitts made a couple of podcast appearances on Tucker Carlson's and Danny Jones' shows, making some incredible statements regarding one of my favorite topics, deep underground military bases or dumbs.

49:34.000 --> 49:45.000
Over the years, Fitts has also engaged in some intriguing discussion of UFO legacy programs on Dark Journalist's page, including UFO economies 1, 2, and 3.

49:45.000 --> 49:53.000
Here's the thing, I'm glad you brought this up because I know you've had Richard on, and again, Richard's going to be on the Salier Report next week.

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
And that's Richard Dole and the author of UFOs in the National Security State.

49:57.000 --> 50:13.000
Well, that's the best book in terms of describing the mechanisms put in place after World War II to create a far-expanded infrastructure for what I call the black budget.

50:13.000 --> 50:31.000
So you literally see the federal credit engineered in a way that can generate trillions and trillions of dollars for an infrastructure of private corporations and investors to control the most powerful technology in the world.

50:31.000 --> 50:56.000
To try and figure out what that technology is, you know, is to go down a rabbit hole full of very squiggling information about what is and is not true, but suffice it to say that a tremendous amount of that money has gone into very high technology weaponry and certainly an investment in space and space travel.

50:56.000 --> 51:11.000
Fitz is surprisingly well-versed in UFO legacy programs, commenting on covert space economies, breakaway civilizations, the SDI or Strategic Defense Initiative being used to counter extraterrestrial threats, and black budget operations surrounding UFOs.

51:11.000 --> 51:28.000
Fitz even once argued to Dark Journalist, up to $60 trillion may have been spent on secret space program and UFO technologies, suggesting TUO or Technologies of Unknown Origin may be worth up to $150 trillion.

51:28.000 --> 51:39.000
Perhaps one day I can sit down with Catherine Austin-Fitz and have a very poignant discussion on UFO legacy program financing, but I would like to circle back to black budget of the United States.

51:40.000 --> 51:52.000
In the paper, Fitz writes, quote, large portions of the nation's wealth is being illegally diverted into secret unaccountable channels, end quote, to support clandestine domestic military research and development.

51:52.000 --> 52:04.000
While stat, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Fitz came across evidence IT slash accounting systems providers were responsible for the obfuscation of funds and omitting data where DOD funds were directed.

52:04.000 --> 52:14.000
These included Lockheed Martin information systems, which would later merge with Lados in 2015, IBM, DineCorp, and of course SAIC.

52:14.000 --> 52:33.000
One of the things I used to have these fights with the defense contractors because I was required to get the accounts when we, I still needed data and the systems were run by the big defense contractors at HUD, and they would refuse to give me the data so I'd have these wars with them.

52:33.000 --> 52:40.000
It's like, who really runs HUD? Is it the defense contractor or is it the point, you know, the person who's legally responsible?

52:40.000 --> 53:04.000
And speculating, I'd say they have a very perfect situation to do any type of research they want to under the guise of anything, I mean, and call it what they want.

53:04.000 --> 53:15.000
And they definitely aren't working alone in anything. So anybody doing business with them, they are what's called like a conglomerate.

53:15.000 --> 53:33.000
There's SAIC, but it's made up of numerous individual corporations, and these corporations, some of them are very well known and some of them are smaller, but they have some very big genius minds there and a lot of very cutting-edge work being done there.

53:33.000 --> 53:49.000
And millions and millions of dollars coming in. And since it's privately owned corporations, I don't know, the only people they'd have to report to is the ones they're doing business with and they're contracting with.

53:49.000 --> 54:05.000
And so if the people they're contracting with wish to do something that maybe isn't in the best interest of everyone, nobody is going to know about it.

54:05.000 --> 54:22.000
It's all kept in-house, the funding, the financing, the contracts, there should be files, there should be documentation, and a regular timeline of events on every project which did not exist whatsoever.

54:22.000 --> 54:31.000
And if I'm working in a military division and I have access to all the files, where were these, where was this documentation?

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
So it made me very suspicious of where all this money was going.

54:36.000 --> 54:43.000
Let's now reference the 2001 testimony of former SAIC administrative employee Denise McKenzie.

54:43.000 --> 54:49.000
McKenzie's testimony is somewhat legendary in the UFO legacy program Financial Analyst Community.

54:49.000 --> 54:58.000
After all, McKenzie's experiences were detailed on text in Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document, and she was never heard from again.

54:58.000 --> 55:08.000
It's even more interesting, the big defense contractor that does all the UFO stuff, like for the military and the government, is in La Jolla.

55:08.000 --> 55:18.000
And out in front of their building, they have two eight foot tall Egyptian statues, and one is holding a pyramid in his hand, and this is the past, and one's holding a pyramid in his hand, and this is the future.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
And they're big bronze statues in front of this company.

55:22.000 --> 55:33.000
In this company, I have on one of these tapes a girl testifying how they put billions of dollars or millions of dollars into UFO related programs, and they create them and they're fake.

55:33.000 --> 55:43.000
So when they get audited by the general accounting office of the United States government, it just looks like all the money's going into more helicopters, but it's really going into like UFO related programs.

55:43.000 --> 55:52.000
Today, I'm thrilled to announce I have found McKenzie's March 2001 videotaped interview nestled within the files of the DPI archive.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
I have also found and made outreach to Mrs. McKenzie herself.

55:56.000 --> 56:02.000
I do hope she connects with me in the future, but for now let's analyze her complete recorded testimony.

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
McKenzie was introduced to SAIC while working retail in 1992.

56:06.000 --> 56:17.000
While working at a fabric store in a San Diego mall, a part-time co-worker of McKenzie named Sophia asked her to move to SAIC at La Jolla, San Diego, where Sophia primarily worked.

56:17.000 --> 56:24.000
Denise had never heard of the defense giant, but was intrigued to work a cushy office job on a massive campus.

56:24.000 --> 56:30.000
When she first visited the La Jolla site, McKenzie expected to interview for an administrative assistant position.

56:30.000 --> 56:35.000
But with no paperwork or meetings, McKenzie was immediately told she had the job.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
She didn't even know the department in which she was supposed to work.

56:38.000 --> 56:47.000
During her first few days in the office, McKenzie noticed her recruiter, Sophia, was not present at SAIC and wouldn't show up for another two to three weeks.

56:47.000 --> 56:52.000
During her first three to four days of work, McKenzie had no real tasks.

56:52.000 --> 56:57.000
She would wander her building of work to look busy, gauging the department's computer files and personnel.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
McKenzie would realize she worked within SAIC's military contract division.

57:02.000 --> 57:12.000
Within SAIC La Jolla on Campus Drive, Denise would notice a highly classified biological division that featured extremely strict personnel access control.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
And let's take a quick pause here.

57:14.000 --> 57:19.000
SAIC has a history of intriguing chemical and biological contracts.

57:19.000 --> 57:29.000
Let's note this 2005 SAIC Research Development Test and Evaluation Group contract that tasked SAIC's McLean, Virginia and San Diego, California divisions

57:29.000 --> 57:43.000
to perform biological, chemical, radiological, nuclear, and explosive, or CBRNE work with the Air Force Operational Test Center and Evaluation Center, or AFO-TEC, at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.

57:43.000 --> 57:58.000
Kirtland Air Force Base is not only home to a deep underground military installation, but also to Sandia National Labs, an FFRDC, which is a usual tricky customer of this channel for operational locations of UFO legacy programs.

57:58.000 --> 58:08.000
Recurring viewers of my channel will absolutely recognize Sandia, and by the way, SAIC has a history of absolutely enormous contracts with Sandia National Labs,

58:08.000 --> 58:16.000
such as this 2013 $228 million contract for IT consolidation for, quote,

58:16.000 --> 58:27.000
mission-specific information technology research development and integration of capabilities while maintaining high-performance and central-hosting computing desktop services and cybersecurity, end quote.

58:27.000 --> 58:39.000
What is interesting about this specific relationship with SAIC and AFO-TEC for CBRNE work we just mentioned above is a quote from SAIC's Senior Vice President Chuck Zhang, quote,

58:39.000 --> 58:57.000
under the CBRNE contract, SAIC will assess new and emerging technologies and concepts, will work to determine their technological maturity when operated under realistic environments to help give US warfighters the tools they need to do their jobs more safely and effectively, end quote.

58:57.000 --> 59:07.000
It is interesting how SAIC's biological work has been contracted from AFO-TEC, or the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center we just mentioned above.

59:07.000 --> 59:19.000
AFO-TEC historically has supported the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Advanced Systems and Concepts, or DUSD-AS&C, for all non-traditional acquisition programs.

59:19.000 --> 59:28.000
In the future, I'll be paying much closer attention to this DUSD-AS&C and the office's possible involvement in UFO legacy programs.

59:28.000 --> 59:39.000
After all, according to the General Accounting Office in 2002, DUSD-AS&C was responsible for DOD Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration Programs.

59:39.000 --> 59:50.000
The connections to our work here are indeed perplexing. SAIC has a history of being awarded sole-source contracts to support the Joint Technology Assessment Activity, or JTAA.

59:50.000 --> 01:00:00.000
A large part of the JTAA portfolio supports the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Advanced Systems and Concepts, or the DUSD-AS&C.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Many of these sole-source SAIC JTAA contracts are for work at, you guessed it, the Naval Service Warfare Center Crane, which allegedly houses the Off-World Technologies Division.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Funny enough, former DUSD-AS&C appointees have a history of working for contractors suspected of being involved with UFO legacy program operations before and after service in the Office of the Undersecretary for Defense.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:37.000
These include Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Sue C. Payton, who served as a manager of advanced technology and Lockheed Martin before her service in the DOD.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000
But after that brief sidestep into SAIC and their biological departments, let's get back to the story of Denise McKenzie.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000
McKenzie's work picked up when she received numerous letters from U.S. military and defense contractors requesting Project Report updates.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:07.000
McKenzie's immediate superiors blew off the importance of these Project Report updates, instructing McKenzie to issue a generic response to DOD and contractors alike, saying something to the effect of, quote, we're working on it, end quote.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Eager to perform efficiently in her new role, Denise McKenzie would retrieve files and computer disks pertaining to the letters she received.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Each and every contract file, ranging from recent to several years old, contained only two to three form letters, all stating the same thing, quote, it's being worked on, end quote.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Some of these forms were signed by SAIC senior personnel and some were left completely unsigned.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:41.000
These were enormous contracts worth millions and millions of dollars with absolutely zero activity on the contracts.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:51.000
McKenzie reported the missing contract activity to her recruiter, Sophia, who grew furious Denise took initiative to search through SAIC's file database.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:03.000
During her interview, Denise pondered why Sophia, positioned under SAIC's head scientist, was working and recruiting new SAIC administrative personnel from a fabric store at a mall.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:11.000
McKenzie was ordered to bring all files and disks pertaining to relevant contracts to her immediate superiors and to forget all about the matter.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.000
In her following short time at SAIC, McKenzie was harassed by her head supervisor, a man named Stuart Stanley.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I'm trying to track down this Stuart and while unable to find him yet, I haven't covered a man by that name residing in La Jolla San Diego at the time of Denise's employment at SAIC.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:39.000
McKenzie's final straw occurred at the contractor when she choked on food and her immediate supervisor stood by and watched instead of attempting to help or to call an ambulance.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:52.000
After leaving the company, McKenzie would search the early internet for her recruiter, Sophia, and would eventually find an image of Sophia on a CIA website with a different first name and same last name.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:03.000
This webpage listed deceased agents and while her incident took place in 1992, quote unquote, Sophia had supposedly died in 1987 or 1988.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Remember if you will, SAIC's relationship with the NSA, intimate ties with the US Big Five intelligence agencies appear rampant with SAIC.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I thought they were getting a lot of money for doing nothing and I didn't know where that money was going.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It's like a friend, a friend for something. I mean, if it wasn't such a big complex and evidently well known, which I found out, you know, as I worked there, I would have been very suspicious of what was going on.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And if you wanted to just hide funds or push funds through and call it whatever you want, Joe's Market, I mean, it was like Joe's Market on a huge scale.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So what was I to do about it? I mean, there wasn't much I could say or do about it.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Mackenzie was not the only SAIC employee in 1992 to make such allegations. According to the excellent 2007 Vanity Fair article titled Washington's Shadow, quote,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:20.000
According to one former executive in a sworn deposition in 1992, the practice of quote unquote mischarging became institutionalized within the company, end quote.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Analyzing Mackenzie's testimony, we can see SAIC ran enormous contracts with DoD and other contractors with absolutely zero activity on these contracts.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:39.000
This implies these monies were funneled from legitimate projects into more secret black budget clandestine operations.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And perhaps we have a real instance of this we can analyze.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Banning into space, a layered defense to protect the country from nuclear devastation.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:08.000
U.S. spy satellites would watch the world below, detect Soviet missiles blasting off, compute the position and speed of each missile,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
alert battle stations in space on Earth.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:21.000
The first response, space-based kinetic energy weapons fire high-speed projectiles from hypervelocity guns,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
intercepting enemy missiles as they are boosted through the atmosphere.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Popped up into space, Earth-based nuclear-powered X-ray lasers fire their radioactive rays.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Attack rays from land-based eczema lasers are redirected by huge mirrors orbiting in space.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Chemical lasers fire beams that burn through the shell of the onrushing missile.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Particle beam weapons with pulsing rays join the attack.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Still over the atmosphere.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
In the same year of 1992, then-Secretary of Defense, the infamous Dick Cheney,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.000
was called to investigate whistleblower claims of fraud and waste surrounding the Strategic Defense Initiative.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Since 1986, scientist Aldrich Saussier claimed the SDI, or Star Wars program,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
displayed a pattern of, quote, miss-management and abuse,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
and wasteful spending on research and development,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
end quote, miss-reporting and misleading Congress of its efficacy.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Saussier was dismissed from the Star Wars program for, quote, poor performance

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
and was even investigated by the FBI.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Democratic Congressman John Conyers determined actions against Saussier were whistleblower retaliatory activities.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And by 1992, Cheney reviewed the case and Saussier was given whistleblower protection.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
But why is any of this important here?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I have talked in several projects of backdoor UFO programs being built into Ronald Reagan's 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
a missile defense system built to defend the United States from attacks by ballistic nuclear missiles.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Let's break this down in a second, but since SDI's inception in 1983,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
U.S. contractors including SAIC and their systems integrator abilities

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000
were relied on more than ever by the Defense Department for successful implementation of SDI.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.000
In 1985, SAIC had an employee, retired USAF two-star general Jasper Welch

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
that exclusively coordinated with Star Wars efforts.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000
In 1985, SAIC had won more strategic defense initiative-related contracts

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
than General Dynamics, Northrop, Raytheon, Grumman, and the Rand Corporation combined.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Beginning in 1978 and throughout Star Wars, SAIC was, quote,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.000
best represented contractor, end quote, for a key SDI technology, particle beam weapons.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
So essentially, SAIC had been accused by Catherine Austin Fitz

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
as back-channeling money from legitimate contracts into clandestine operations.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative was proven by the whistleblower claims of

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Aldrich Saussier to purposely mislead Congress on the efficacy of SDI,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
end quote, wasteful spending on research and development, end quote.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And SAIC was considered a critical contractor for their expertise and reliability for critical work on SDI.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Now I just previously said there are numerous implications

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:30.000
SDI actually held a swath of UFO programs that saw secret monies backchannel from primarily SDI funding mechanisms.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.000
With SAIC's work on SDI and history of illegally diverting funds from legitimate to black-budget contracts,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I do not at all think it is a stretch to assume SAIC was one of the primary contractors

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
engaged with SDI and UFO legacy programs.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Previously, I discussed the involvement of Northrop, the Grumman Corporation,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000
and Teledyne Ryan, a Northrop Grumman purchase in regards to SDI and UFO programs,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
but today we have much more to discuss.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.000
One whistleblower I have covered in depth on this channel is former USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000
in his claims of the reverse engineered alien reproduction vehicle called the TR-3B.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000
As I have stated before, although Fouchet was unable to provide material evidence for the existence of TR-3B,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
his disclosures have served to deliver some extremely actionable intelligence.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
During his 1998 disclosures, Fouchet would discuss the DARCE,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000
the Defense Advanced Research Center allegedly stationed underground near Area 51 Grum Lake

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000
that worked on UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation projects.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
The DARCE in question, the Defense Advanced Research Center,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
not to be confused with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
was actually a proposed institution.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:53.000
So let's reference this declassified Advanced Research Project Agency study written in 1973.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.000
The study in question was written as a historical evaluation of the R&D Management Institution, ARPA,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
who at this time had, quote,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000
remarkably little in the way of an official record or institutional memory had been established, end quote.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000
On page 82 of the document under ARPA Laboratories discussing advanced aerospace projects,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
we find a DOD directive showing the Army Ballistic Missile Agency

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
was considered for transfer into the DARCE, the Defense Advanced Research Center,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
linking the department to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
And it is worth noting the Army Ballistic Missile Agency

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
was commanded by Nazi V-2 rocket scientist

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
in Operation Paperclip Transfer, Werner von Braun.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Von Braun's mentor was father of German rocketry, Hermann Oberth,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
who performed extensive study on UFOs.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.000
And I've previously covered how extensively Nazi scientists were involved in early UFO programs,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
such as discussing Hans Kamler, director of numerous Nazi special weapons projects

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
who may have been tasked with studying the 1933 Magenta Italy crashed UFO,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
who curiously went missing near the end of the war,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
but was claimed to be working with Americans post-World War II,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
as well as Xavier Dorsch, head of the TOT organization,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000
who was requested by Air Material Command for Operation Paperclip for underground plant construction.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Fusche would state DARCE was bolstered in the mid-1980s

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
when the institution was flushed with money from the Strategic Defense Initiative.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Fusche and his sources estimated up to 35% of SDI's funding

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
was siphoned off to support the UFO Black programs.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Indeed, for its maiden operational flight in the mid-1990s,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Fusche would state the TR-3B, whose program was administrated by the NRO, NSA, and CIA,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.000
and worked primarily by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, and Teledyne Ryan,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
the reverse engineered vehicle was built by Strategic Defense Initiative money.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
In 2013, stealth aircraft researcher Joseph Jones

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
would claim the existence of Project Brilliant Buzzard,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
a codename for an airborne surveillance and tracking program

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
that dealt with setting up an electromagnetic shield around the US,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
utilizing an enormous boomerang-shaped craft.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
This boomerang featured an almost indefinite loiter time,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000
and Brilliant Buzzard was allegedly primarily contracted to Boeing.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.000
The Brilliant Buzzard craft was seemingly responsible for 25,000 eye-witness sightings

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
between 1983 and 1989 of the Hudson Valley boomerang,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000
and this enormous craft was, of course, allegedly a program born from the Strategic Defense Initiative.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Viewers of my channel will know I adore referencing the work of legendary

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
UFO crash retrieval investigator Leonard Stringfield

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
to analyze relevant UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation cases.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
And as it turns out, we do have a rather intriguing Star Wars case

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
in crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000
specifically 1991's UFO crash retrievals the Inner Sanctum Status Report 6.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Stringfield's eclectic work analyzed a 1989 UFO crash retrieval case

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
alleged to have occurred over Maritius Bay, Long Island, New York, USA.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Now, be mindful that there is an additional Long Island, New York UFO crash retrieval case

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
that allegedly occurred in 1992.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
This 92 case is indeed perplexing and features numerous eye-witnesses

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
and the possible involvement of the Department of Energy's

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000
FFRDC Brookhaven National Laboratory located in Upton, New York.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Perhaps we will revisit this case in an extended session soon,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
but let's circle back to 1989, the work of Stringfield

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000
and reporting from LIUFON, the Long Island UFO Network.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
This case details a crashed UFO in the area of Maritius Bay

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
off the south shore of Suffolk County, Long Island, New York

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
on the early morning of 29 September 1989.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
And according to LIUFON and Stringfield, the craft crashing was not an accident,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
but instead a carefully planned and executed military intelligence operation to down the craft.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
According to an anonymous Air Force Intelligence Colonel,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.000
the incident involved the downing of a UFO by the use of a US Star Wars weapon on that night.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
The craft crashed into the Dune area where it was subsequently retrieved, end quote.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Quite shockingly, this unnamed Colonel additionally stated

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
18 US servicemen were killed by biologics on board the craft

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
who retaliated with a device that quote,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
generates extremely low frequency sound waves

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
which can destroy the molecular cohesiveness of known matter.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Quite the extraordinary claim and a claim that I can find no record of

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
regarding the deaths of several US servicemen.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
However, multiple eyewitnesses including a commodities broker

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
claimed to have seen helicopters transporting a large object

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
and military vehicles with a police escort headed towards Brookhaven National Labs.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Another anonymous source, this time a Brookhaven scientist named Dr. Nick,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000
told LIUFON investigators a large wedge or boomerang shaped object

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000
with shockingly low mass was recovered and transported to Brookhaven.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Having previously worked under Wright Patterson AFB to study UFOs,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Dr. Nick claimed the weapon utilized to down the craft was constructed by AIL electronics.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Now remember how the anonymous Colonel claimed the craft was down

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
by a strategic defense initiative weapon

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
and according to Dr. Nick, Brookhaven National Labs deployed this weapon.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Brookhaven is of course a Department of Energy sponsored FFRDC.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Brookhaven additionally did work on the strategic defense initiative

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
such as aiding in SDI's lethality and target hardening projects.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Reference for example this 1987 DTIC document titled

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Report to the Congress on Strategic Defense Initiative and quote

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Alongside White Sands missile range and Los Alamos National Labs,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Brookhaven aided SDI through study and testing of SDI weapons

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
that quote required lethal energy to achieve a sure kill

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
against the full spectrum of enemy targets.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
One contractor that worked alongside Brookhaven,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
White Sands and Los Alamos for SDI's lethality and target hardening program

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
was of course SAIC.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Interesting how SAIC and Brookhaven which was allegedly involved

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
with shooting down a UFO over Long Island, New York

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000
both worked on SDI's and specifically the Defense Nuclear Agency's

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
lethality and target hardening programs that had a specific goal

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
of assessing the lethality of X-ray laser weapons against SDI threats.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000
All this boils down of course to the subject of directed energy weapons.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Sources of mine have specifically informed me of SDI X-ray weapons

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
that were used to disable and down UFOs.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
These connections between SAIC, black budget monies

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
and Reagan's strategic defense initiative are quite potent

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
and well worth exploring further in our future studies.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.000
SAIC's misappropriation of funds doesn't just stop with the testimony of Mackenzie

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
or likely involvement with SDI UFO programs.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:05.000
No, we have very real examples of SAIC wasting obscene amounts of money on contracts.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.000
In 2002, a consortium run by SAIC including Boeing and Booz Allen Hamilton

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000
was chosen by the National Security Agency to create Trailblazer.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
A system intended to analyze mass collections of data on communication methods

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
such as cell phones, email, and internet.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
This contract was worth at its inception over $280 million

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
and ballooned to billions within four years.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
This program was even worked on by SAIC board member Bobby Ray Inman.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Multiple NSA employees filed a complaint with the DoD Inspector General

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:45.000
regarding enormous amounts of fraud, waste, and abuse existing in SAIC's Trailblazer

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
when a successful operating prototype had already previously existed.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
By 2005, the DoD Inspector General released a report on the investigation

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
where 90-plus percent of the findings were redacted.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Some of the whistleblowers here including NSA employee William Binney

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
were harassed and raided by the FBI.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Interesting how Binney has additionally commented on UFOs.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Well, I think my problem is just like the UFO thing.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Unless they start addressing these kinds of things,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.000
that people's observations or basic measurements or facts

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
will kind of evidence that simply exist.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Unless they start addressing them, there's always going to be questions

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
that people are going to question and never trust.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I mean, especially now with the government, how much trust do you have in this government?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Bizarrely, after the colossal failure that was Trailblazer,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
SAIC was immediately awarded a contract for Execute Locust,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.000
a revised Trailblazer program well worth $361 million.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
SAIC's failed efforts on enormous contracts are not uncommon.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Take VCF for example, Virtual Case File,

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
a $124 million contract with the FBI

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
to create an online central repository of data to serve the FBI.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Only three years into Virtual Case File,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
the project was written off by a global publication for technology professionals

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
as the, quote,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
most highly publicized software failure in history, end quote.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
According to the 2007 Vanity Fair article on SAIC,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
we discussed earlier, quote,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
If it turns out they can't deliver,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
new contracts will simply be drawn up, end quote.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Indeed, SAIC's convenient ineptitude to secure lucrative contracts for no work

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
and whopping failures doesn't just end here.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
In 2005, SAIC's La Jolla San Diego location,

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000
which was patrolled by DOD certified industrial security personnel,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
was broken into.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
This never solved burglary, according to SAIC,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
saw the theft of one desktop computer and four laptops

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000
out of 13 private offices containing personal data

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
on thousands of present and past employees.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Presumably including the company's many former CIA operatives

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
and SA executives and Pentagon officials,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
quite the targeted theft here.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And I really cannot stress here how many incredibly suspicious and dubious actions

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
SAIC has conducted over the years that speaks to misappropriation

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
and funneling of funds used, in my opinion,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
for black budget UFO programs.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Further examples in this laundry list include SAIC defrauding

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
the U.S. government from 1987 to 1995

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
by creating fake, non-functioning prototypes for a USAF contract

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
to develop flat panel liquid crystal displays

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
to be used on various fighter jets.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
As well as an early 2000s incident in which SAIC was charged with fraud

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
for submitting, quote, false and fraudulent statements

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
of its expected cost and profits,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
and quote, for waste cleanup at various U.S. Air Force bases.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
But before we move on here, I would like to touch on some of the relationships

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
SAIC has maintained with DOD defense contractors

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
that have been time and time again implicated

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
with black budget projects and UFO legacy programs.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I'd like to draw your attention back to EG&G,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
also known as Edgerton, Germanhausen and Greer Inc.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
and I would wager most on this channel

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
have some familiarity with this intriguing contractor

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:22.000
that historically engaged closely with some of the U.S.'s most secret technologies.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Started by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Harold Edgerton in 1931,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
EG&G's activities are legendary in the UFO community

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:38.000
before the company was acquired by URS in 2002 and again by AECOM in 2014.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Historically, EG&G shared responsibility at the Nevada test site

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
including Nellis Air Force Base in Area 51

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
for weapons development and high-tech testing

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
alongside Lawrence Livermore Labs, Raytheon and others.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
EG&G's legendary status in the UFO community

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000
arose from it being labeled as the contractor Bob Lazar claimed

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.000
hired him to reverse engineer UFO propulsion systems at Area 51 site 4.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Quite recently, I also discussed how EG&G was one of multiple components connected

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
with UFO legacy programs that comprised the Department of Energy NEST

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
or Nuclear Emergency Response Team

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
and how I wagered the DOE NEST supported by EG&G

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
was the on-site technical and scientific team

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000
that recovered a crashed UFO in the Peruvian jungle in 1997

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
witnessed by USMC Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
According to journalist George Knapp, Alfred O'Donnell,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
a now deceased former senior manager at EG&G,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
relayed to Knapp that quote-unquote they, meaning EG&G,

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
had in its possession a flying saucer recovered in New Mexico

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
as well as live non-human beings that looked vaguely human.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Remember EG&G but just stick around here with me for a second

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
as I state to probably an annoying degree

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
a key component overlooked from joint USG contractor

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
UFO legacy program operations are the subject matter experts

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:09.000
and R&D ACES, FFRDCs are federally funded research and development centers.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Over the course of my work, I have accused numerous such FFRDCs

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
as acting as key players in UFO material exploitation

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
and crash retrieval programs including Sandia National Labs,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Los Alamos National Labs,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
the Center for Naval Analysis, the MITRE Corporation,

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
the RAND Corporation and more.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
The Administrator for Los Alamos National Labs, for example,

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
on behalf of the Department of Energy

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.000
is a little known corporation known as Triad National Security LLC.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Triad National Security has a storied history of intriguing publications

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.000
but relevant to our discussion is how Triad is comprised of three entities,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Texas A&M University, the University of California

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
and Battelle Memorial Institute.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Alongside FFRDCs, I have spoken on their university

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
semi-private counterparts, UARCs,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
or university affiliated research centers

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
and their involvement in UFO legacy programs.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
The two universities comprising Triad are not UARCs,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
but interesting nonetheless.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
The contractor here of interest within Triad is Battelle

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
and Battelle is no stranger to this channel.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
From its possible involvement studying Roswell Shape Memory Alloys

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
to its parallel project Blue Book called Project Stork

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
to research associating Battelle

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
to dugway-proving ground UFO legacy programs,

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Battelle is infamous on this channel.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Battelle itself runs multiple FFRDCs including Oak Ridge,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
a Sean Kirkpatrick safe haven post-arrow where he joined as CTO,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Savannah River National Labs,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
and the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center,

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
all of whom I suspect are involved in UFO legacy programs.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
So isn't it interesting that Battelle formed a new LLC

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000
under a trio of institutions to manage sites for the Department of Energy?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Here we can finally circle back.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000
On 15 September 2004, SAIC entered into a similar venture.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Analyzing a Form 10 SEC document,

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
we can see that in 2004 SAIC entered into an agreement

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
with EG&G Technical Services,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
as well as Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, Inc.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.000
to form RDS, Research and Development Solutions, LLC.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
A now defunct group, RDS was quickly assigned

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
to the Department of Energy's National Energy Technical Laboratory

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000
shortly after its founding with a total value of $217 million.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Indeed, by 27 September 2004,

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
RDS was securing even more contracts with DOE,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000
with some contracts of up to $41 million.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
The DOE's National Energy Technical Laboratory's mission

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
is to, quote, advance the national economic and energy security

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
of the United States, end quote.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.000
In RDS's founding year, the NETL had a budget of over $900 million,

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
which was used for R&D programs in support of the DOE's offices

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.000
of fossil energy, energy efficiency and renewable energy and energy assurance,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
as well as work with other federal agencies.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
RDS was brought on to, quote,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
support the management and integration of all stages of science

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
and technological development at NETL,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
which could lead to commercially viable solutions in the energy area,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
specific technical services areas to be performed

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
include R&D technology planning and analysis,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
R&D operations, process engineering design and analysis,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
computational research simulation and visualization,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
environment safety and health assurance,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
and partnership development, end quote.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Of course, NETL has no direct connection we can see to UFO legacy programs,

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
but it is interesting that NETL does have connections to three companies

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000
ranging from possibly to almost certainly involved in UFO legacy programs.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Outside of RDS, SAIC engaged in multiple projects with EG&G,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000
as well as other contractors I suspect engage in UFO exploitation programs,

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
such as L3Harris and Alien Science and Technology,

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:18.000
as demonstrated in this 2005 250 million joint war fighting center support contract.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
If Alien Science and Technology sits on the tip of your tongue,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
that very well may be because this is a contractor mentioned alongside

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
the testimony of witness Ed.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Ed served as a director for an electronics warfare group

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
out of the Edwards 412th Test Wing,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
which is a major range and test facility base,

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
and claimed to work directly with scientists and test pilots

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
of reverse engineered UFO vehicles.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
According to Ed, this program operated across the Nevada test and training range,

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
as well as the Edwards 412th Test Wing,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Edwards Air Force Base, Nellis Air Force Base, Area 51, S4,

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
and underground connective tissue.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
After his very real time at Edwards,

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Ed went on to work at the Pentagon

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
for USAF Research Development Test and Evaluation Panel chain,

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
where he claimed dozens of billions of dollars went missing each year

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
in non-TOA or non-transfer of authority funds.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
During his time at the Pentagon,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Ed also joined Alien Science and Technologies in Crystal City, Virginia

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
as an F-35 subject matter expert.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I have also guest with the enormous bloated budget of the F-35 program

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
around $2 trillion,

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.000
this aircraft platform may hide funds for UFO program operations.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
In a similar venture to RDS LLC by SAIC and EG&G,

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
and Triad National Security LLC under Battelle,

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
in 1999, the same year Northrop Grumman purchased Teledyne Ryan

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
and was engaged in a purchasing spree I have connected to UFO programs,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:52.000
SAIC and Northrop entered a joint venture to create AMSEC LLC.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
AMSEC grew from $100 million in revenue in 2000

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
to $500 million in revenue by 2007.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Quote,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
AMSEC contracts primarily with the Navy

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
are expected to gross $500 million next year.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
AMSEC is jointly owned by Newport News Shipbuilding,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
a division of Northrop Grumman,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
and Science Applications International Corporation.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
End quote.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.000
AMSEC specializes in providing naval architecture and marine engineering,

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
naval ship systems assessments, maintenance engineering,

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
waterfront maintenance support, acquisition program support,

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
shipyard industrial engineering,

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000
and C4I installation and support services.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000
AMSEC also provides lifecycle integrated logistics services,

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
including technical manual development,

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
provisioning documentation, spare parts management,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
training development and delivery, and software development.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
By the 2010s, AMSEC operated as a major contractor

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
providing engineering and technical services

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
in support of the Navy modernization program.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Some AMSEC, IDIQ, or indefinite delivery and definite quantity contracts.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000
A contracting method, David Grush has stated support legacy program funding

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
saw 2015 contracts north of $83 million

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
for Naval Surface Warfare Centers for AMSEC.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Consider me intrigued here, as I have previously discussed,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
and as we will discuss later,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
the testimony of Randy Anderson and SAIC

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
running the Off-World Technologies Division

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000
below NSWC Crane in 2012 to 2015.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
In my projects, when discussing DOD contractors,

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
FFRDCs, and new arcs,

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I try and single out official reports, internal reports,

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
defense technical intelligence center documents, etc.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
to attempt to draw parallels to UFO legacy programs.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Previous references have included project updates on Project Stork

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
and metallurgical alloy analysis by Battelle.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
TRW's work on high-speed underground tunnels

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
possibly connecting deep underground military bases.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
1972's Project Outgrowth

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
out of the US Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
at Edwards Air Force Base detailing anti-gravity propulsion

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
and many, many, many more.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Of course, seen as it's our subject today,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
SAIC has their own compelling historical documentation.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
In 1988, SAIC began work on a report titled

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Electric Propulsion Study for Edwards Air Force Base's

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Aeronautics Laboratory in the Air Force Base Technology Center,

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
AFSC.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
As we've discussed throughout today, viewers of my channel

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
will recall my extremely high conviction regarding a joint

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
UFO-ARV Alien Reproduction Vehicle Program

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
existing between Edwards Air Force Base

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
and the Nevada Test and Training Range.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Again, this was covered in great detail on my video on Ed,

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
an electronics warfare test director out of Edwards

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
who claimed to operate this program

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000
engaging with UFO legacy program scientists

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
and ARV pilots.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
This 1988 SAIC document, released August of 1990,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000
was written by SAIC investigator Dennis Cravens

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
and featured extensive contribution

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
from Assistant Director of Los Alamos National Labs

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Center for Explosive Technology Research,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Ferris Williams.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
This paper discusses the byfield-brown effect.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Los Alamos National Labs and Lawrence Livermore National Labs

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
work on highly classified power density devices

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
for the Strategic Defense Initiative

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
and ultimately suggests a five-dimensional approach

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
to unifications of fields for novel propulsion methods.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
The report also suggests anti-gravity could be achieved

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
by using rotating cylinders filled with mercury

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
and should be considered for oceanic and atmospheric applications.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Intriguing to say the least, as this rotating mercury system

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
is the exact propulsion method,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet claimed originated

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
from reverse engineering out of Sandia

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
in Lawrence Livermore National Labs

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
that powered the TR-3B Alien Reproduction Vehicle.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
The circular plasma-filled accelerator ring

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
called the Magnetic Field Disruptor

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
surrounds a rotatable crew compartment.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
as far as technology.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
a reverse-engineered MFD

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
and I believe the government will go at any lengths

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
to protect this technology.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
But you're not going to be able to build one of these

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
from what I tell you, nor am I.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
The government will go to any lengths.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Believe me, the plasma in this accelerator

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
is mercury-based.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
It's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin,

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
superconductivity,

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
to create a superconductive plasma

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
with a resulting gravity energy.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
The MFD generates a magnetic vortex field

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
which disrupts and neutralizes the effects of gravity on mass

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
within proximity by 89%.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Do not misunderstand, this is not anti-gravity.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Just for consideration,

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
it is also interesting how this Ferris-Williams,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
mentioned in this report,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
also spoke at a June 2001 UFO Technology Conference

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
where it was mentioned his research was sponsored

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
by Hal Putoff.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000
This conference was actually held in La Jolla, San Diego

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
with immediate proximity to numerous SAIC locations

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
and their California headquarters.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
In July of 2018,

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000
journalist George Knapp released a leaked version of 38 DIRDS,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
or Defense Intelligence Reference Documents

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
created under the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program,

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
or ATIP.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
ATIP, of course, is the controversial office

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Lou Elizondo claimed to direct, work for,

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
or operate under in various capacities.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Much discussion has been conducted

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
surrounding ATIP versus ASAP,

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
This is of course not the subject of today's video,

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
and while I maintain ATIP was likely a white world cover

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
for more classified programs under ASAP,

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
we will not be discussing the complexities

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
of ATIP versus ASAP today.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
On 16 January 2019,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
the Black Vault received a list of the aforementioned

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
DIRD reports under FOIA.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
By March 2022,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
the Black Vault had successfully received copies

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
of all 38 DIRD reports.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I have discussed these DIRDS before.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
The subject matter and topics of them

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
are simply astounding.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
The DIRDS feature highly scientific

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
and technical reports by various authors

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
that touch on multiple core positions

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
from spatial slash temporal translation

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
to armament.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Some of these DIRDS include focus on

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
space-time metric engineering by Hal Putoff,

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
brain-machine interfaces by Dr. R. Genick,

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
pulsed high-power microwave weaponry

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
by Dr. James Wells,

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
and advanced aerospace configurations

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
by Dr. Paul Sizz.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
And it is interesting how in 2001,

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Dr. Sizz appeared as a whistleblower

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
In his tape testimony to Greer,

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Sizz discussed his eight years in the Air Force

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
and 30 years working for the McDonald-Douglas

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
aircraft company.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Sizz discussed its involvement tracking UFOs

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
while at Wright-Patterson,

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
clocked at 20,000 miles per hour,

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000
performing unusual and silent maneuvers,

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
as well as his time in classified projects

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
at McDonald-Douglas.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Within these DIRDS are numerous papers

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.000
written by the infamous Dr. Eric Davis,

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000
covering such topics as traversable wormholes,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
stargates, and negative energy,

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
anti-gravity for aerospace applications,

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
and concepts for extracting energy

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
from the quantum vacuum.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
In a similar vein to these exotic DIRDS,

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Davis had previously written a mind-boggling report

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
from 2001 to 2003,

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
titled Teleportation Physics Study.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
If you are somehow unfamiliar with Davis,

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000
please check out my project on the Wilson Davis Notes

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000
or my interview with Davis on Jesse Michael's channel.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Davis wrote teleportation physics study

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
for the Air Force Research Laboratory,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
AFRL, for Air Force Material Command

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
at Edwards Air Force Base.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Davis would go on to work at AFRL

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
and would state during the Seoul 2024 Symposium,

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
AFRL was where he uncovered irrefutable evidence

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
of UFO legacy program operations.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Teleportation Physics Study devotes

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
an entire report section to p-teleportation,

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
a form of psychokinesis, quote,

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
similar to telekinesis,

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000
but generally used to designate the movement of objects

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000
through other physical objects over great distances.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Telekinesis is a form of p-k,

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
which describes the movement of stationary objects

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
without the use of any known physical force,

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
and p-k is essentially the direct influence

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
of mind-on-matter without any known

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
immediate physical energy or instrumentation, end quote.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
This p-k phenomenon, p-teleportation section,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
stated much of the theoretical

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
slash experimental slash operational work on the subject

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
was based off a little known program

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000
conducted at SRI International with the NSA.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Sponsored at times by the CIA, DIA,

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
and US Army INSCOM

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000
that would later relocate to SAIC.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
This was the infamous remote viewing program,

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
a.k.a. Project Stargate.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Well, there was, like, CIA docs about consciousness

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
and, like, weird remote viewing stuff.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000
I mean, besides the Stargate program

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
that were released in the FOIA reading room

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
on CIA's website, too, that are pretty trippy.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
We're like, wow, CIA's looking into

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
some really interesting stuff.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I mean, they're a hardcore intel agency.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
What's going on there?

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
But it makes sense that they would kind of

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
have to find out if that's p-k.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Like, you can't ignore that

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
if you're really doing your job.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
If your job is intelligence.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Like, okay, like, let's look at this.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
What's an aspect of the phenomenon,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
because it's like a reach out from

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
the crash retrieval program, like, hey,

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I need you to look into some weird stuff,

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
because it might be the key unlock

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
for something that we got in a warehouse, you know?

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Yeah.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I speak often on the possibility

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
some non-human vehicles are controlled

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
not with complex control surfaces,

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
but instead with thoughts or cognition.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
These sentiments have largely and recently

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
been associated with Jake Barber

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
and the discussion of psionics

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
and programs focused on utilizing

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
anomalous cognition to lure in UFO

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000
to shoot them down with EMP weaponry.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
And we came to a conclusion even in those days

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
that the reason most flying saucers have failed

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000
is because our conclusion was that this being

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
is part of the guidance system.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
He's part of that saucer.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
But as we just saw,

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000
discussion of UFOs and cognition far predate Barber.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
The late Colonel Philip J. Corso would claim

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
he and the Army's Foreign Technology Division

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
under Arthur Trudeau were in the early 1960s,

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
tasked with numerous projects for the purpose

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
of seeding and adapting technologies

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
plucked from UFO crash retrievals,

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
specifically Roswell, into the U.S. military

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
industry, if possible.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
One such project, started in 1961,

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
was focused on, quote,

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
control guidance by brainwaves, end quote.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Corso had learned from official Roswell files

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
the biologics on board the crash disk

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
were part of the guidance system.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
The Foreign Technology Division sought to

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
adapt this technology to allow humans

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000
to control ballistic missiles via brainwaves.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I've just had one of the most senior scientists

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
in the U.S. Defense Department's former

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.000
admitted to me that he was read into

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
a UFO crash retrieval program.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I've spoken to well over 20 people now.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000
What I was told consistently was

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
the technology is mind-blowing,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
and they are not in a position

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
to be able to engineer it yet,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
because it's just light years

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000
beyond what we have.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
It's a completely new type of physics,

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
is what one person said to me.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
And you might be interested in this, Jay,

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:02.000
because of the sort of direction

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
that your interests have taken.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Without expanding on it,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
one of the people I spoke to told me

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
that it had a lot to do with

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
a mind-interface connection with the engineering

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
that it was driven by some kind of consciousness

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
or some kind of intelligent connection

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.000
with machinery that was beyond our understanding.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Indeed, similar claims can be found

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
within the files of the late legendary

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Leonard Stringfield.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Analyzing Stringfield's notes

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
reveals a conversation with one Mr. Hines,

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
who had a source from Bell Labs.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Of course, Bell Labs I've discussed before,

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000
as having involvement in UFO legacy programs.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Lenn spoke to a Mr. Hines,

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
who had a source from Bell Labs.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
The informants stated that he was on the flight line

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000
at a California Air Force Base in the early 1950s,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
and saw a UFO retrieval brought in.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
He allegedly saw a cutaway of the recovered craft,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
plus the headband transceiver worn by the aliens.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Anyone involved with the retrieval

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
was subject to intense scrutiny and search.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Apparently, one man must have kept a part of the craft,

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
and he mysteriously disappeared.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
He was never seen again.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000
What I can tell you is that people who work on this technology

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
tell me it has no control systems,

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
no control surfaces,

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000
no visible propulsion system,

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
no dials, no levers, no buttons.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000
It's a shell.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000
They tell me it's operated by consciousness.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Go figure.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.000
When analyzing USG's special access programs

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
focused on anomalous mental phenomena,

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000
being moved into the secrecy of the corporate world,

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I can't help but to think of direct parallels

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
to UFO legacy programs.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Acknowledged US programs into anomalous cognition

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000
began in 1977 with Project Stargate.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Project Stargate was a joint secret army,

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:01.000
DIA, CIA, and SRI International Contractor Program

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
tasked to investigate the potential

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
for military use of psychic phenomena.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
The program went by many codenames

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
based on operational agencies within the program.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Gondola Wish, Stargate,

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Sunstreak for the CIA,

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Grille Flame for INSCOM,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Center Lane for the DIA, etc.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
This was until 1991

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
when the project would consolidate under the Stargate project

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
and be moved to our subject of today, SAIC.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Stargate was initially operated out of Fort Meade, Maryland

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
with a key sponsor of the work

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
being Major General Albert Stubblebine.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Stubblebine founded US Army Intelligence

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
and Security Command INSCOM.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
INSCOM initially commanded the US Special Forces Unit,

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
the ISA, Intelligence Support Activity.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
The ISA was later on moved to JSOC,

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Joint Special Operations Command,

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
where I and others like Chris Sharp

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
have accused JSOC elements of participating

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
in foreign UFO crash retrievals

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
alongside the CIA Office of Global Access.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Stubblebine himself has been accused by numerous individuals

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000
such as Philip J. Corso and Stephen Greer

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000
of participating directly in UFO material exploitation programs

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
at Fort Wachuka, funding clandestine men-in-black type entities

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
and much more.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Stubblebine, according to Greer,

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000
is the man who offered Greer $2 billion

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
to absorb Greer's organization, C-SETI,

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
into the general's work.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
So it is quite intriguing,

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000
a general with keen aptitude for anomalous cognition

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
would also be accused of participating

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
in UFO legacy program operations.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
This reminds me of the quote we just heard from David Grush,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
but let's focus our work back to SAIC.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000
SAIC would continue Stargate from 1991 to 1994.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.000
However, I would wager this work continued long after 1994.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
SAIC published 10 primary studies

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
focused on remote viewing and sci phenomena.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000
SAIC would coin the terms anomalous cognition,

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
also known as remote viewing or clairvoyance,

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
a quote, form of information transfer

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000
in which all known sensorial stimuli are absent.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000
That is, some individuals are able to gain access to information

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.000
by an as yet unknown process, end quote.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
As well as anomalous perturbation,

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
aka psychokinesis, a quote,

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
form of interaction with matter

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
in which all known physical mechanisms are absent.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.000
That is, some individuals are able to influence matter

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.000
by an as yet unknown process, end quote.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
In their official reports,

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
SAIC stated they were and earlier programs

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
were able to verify the existence of anomalous cognition

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000
but not able to verify the existence of anomalous perturbation.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000
SAIC would employ agents and beacons for such experiments.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Agents displayed a quantitative measurement of displays

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
of anomalous cognition and beacons served as individuals

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
who would engage in direct sensorial stimuli

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
from an intended target to act

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000
as a focus of attention for the anomalous cognition receiver.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Some pretty incredible stuff I know,

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
and as I have stated before on numerous occasions,

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000
I am still myself learning about PSY phenomena

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
in relation to the subject of UFOs.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
So for now, we will leave SAIC's work into AC and AP,

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000
but perhaps we will revisit the subject in the future.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000
But SAIC's possible hidden continuation of Stargate

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000
does tie into the last subject we will discuss today.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Naval Support Activity Crane,

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
home to one of the nation's most important military laboratories,

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
is sometimes referred to as the Pentagon's best kept secret,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Senator Joe Donnelly, Indiana.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
As I mentioned at the beginning of this video,

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I have covered the case of Randy Anderson

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
in the Off-World Technologies Division

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
underneath NSWC Crane before.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
This early investigation was taken down

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
to support Randy's testimony reaching a wider audience

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
on Jesse Michael's platform.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
With this investigation into SAIC,

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
I thought it prudent to make my investigation

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
into Randy Anderson available again.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000
This is because the overwhelming majority of that investigation

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
was labeling with high confidence SAIC

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
as the contractor in question in charge

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
of a secret division housing recovered technology.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
So for the full picture, I recommend watching my video

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
to learn more about the data investigation,

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
contractors, military units,

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
and more associated with Randy's story

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
and to hear more from Randy overall,

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I highly recommend viewing Jesse's video.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
But let's briefly summarize Randy's experience

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
and tie it into SAIC.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
In the early to mid-2010s,

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Randy was sent to the Naval Surface Warfare Center

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
in Crane, Indiana for advanced weapons training.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Anderson served as a US Army Green Beret,

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
18 Bravo weapons sergeant,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.000
which meant the soldier was a highly trained expert

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000
in US and foreign small arms weaponry and explosives.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Anderson and his fellow Green Berets

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000
were sent to Crane for weapons testing and training courses.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
However, due to holding a TSSCI clearance,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Anderson and one other soldier

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000
were shown classified foreign and domestic weapon platforms.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
These included disruptive technologies

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
such as unique Russian ballistics.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
But quickly, what is Crane?

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, or NSWC,

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000
is part of the Naval Support Activity Crane

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
alongside the US Army Ammunition Activity,

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
which stockpiles much of the US mainland's munitions.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Crane, Indiana was chosen for these stockpile duties

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.000
during World War II, as such a landlocked state

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
would have proved to have been difficult

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
to be targeted by enemy forces.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
NSWC Crane is a massive facility,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
with several underground layers highlighted

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
as the Premier Navy Lab,

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
whose mission is to quote,

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
provide acquisition and in-service engineering

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
and technical support for sensors, electronics,

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000
electronic warfare, and special warfare weapons,

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
end quote.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Operations at Crane are divided into

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
three distinct focus areas,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
strategic missions, electronic warfare,

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
and expeditionary warfare.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
But this location doesn't focus on conventional missions.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
As we see from this recent Duke University

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000
long-range broad agency announcement,

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
a key focus of Crane's programs

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
is advanced concepts and technologies,

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
end quote.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
And we discussed some of these advanced concepts

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
and technologies earlier in this project

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
with mention of SAIC and the JTAA.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
The underground presence of the base

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
is key to mention here.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Not only are there numerous underground bunkers

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
for munitions storage hidden below the ground,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
but also small arms testing resources,

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000
such as an underground 100 meter firing range.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Now as I mentioned earlier,

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I'm here at Crane to test advanced foreign

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
and domestic weaponry.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
The Crane facility has historically worked closely

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
with the U.S. Army for weapons testing,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
training, and defensive capabilities,

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
such as countering improvised explosive devices in Iraq.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000
And the NSWC is no stranger to reverse engineering,

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
critical technology to maintain quote unquote

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
fleet readiness, such as an intriguing black box

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000
I covered extensively in my first video on Randy Anderson.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Best of my knowledge, NSWC Crane is integral

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000
to naval UFO legacy programs.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Previously, not only did I tie intriguing NSWC Crane contracts

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
to work done on UFO underwater recovery programs

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
operating out of the Navy alongside Woods Hole

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Oceanographic Institute and U.S. intelligence agencies,

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
such as the NRO and the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office,

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000
but let's also mention that NSWC Crane

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
likely resides in a complex system of naval centers

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000
engaged in T-U-O technologies of unknown origin,

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
housing, and exploitation.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
I know I say this all the time,

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
but this really is another video for another day,

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
as I am still deeply engaged with this research.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000
The thesis I am building here, however, is this.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Naval undersea warfare center divisions,

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
such as Keyport, and university affiliated research centers,

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
such as the Applied Research Laboratory

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
at the University of Hawaii at Manoa,

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
engage with UFO data.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Naval surface warfare centers, such as Crane,

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
engage with T-U-O hardware.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
And nav-air installations like China Lake and Patuxent River

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
deal with quote-unquote aircraft.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
This really will be a worthy thread.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000
We will pull on a bit now and more in the future

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.000
that quite likely has SAIC written all over it.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
On 5 June 2025,

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Immaculate Constellation whistleblower Matthew Brown

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
illustrated an enormously impactful tweet

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
that directly referenced UFO materials or craft

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:33.000
being stored at the Patuxent River special project hangars

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
that are owned by the Imentum Corporation

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
amongst quote-unquote other fun spaces.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Of course, alongside Imentum,

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
SAIC has a significant presence

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River,

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.000
enjoying similarly lucrative contracts to NSWC Crane

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
while majorly supporting PAX River's

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Naval Air Warfare Center aircraft division

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
and ship and air integration warfare division.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Remember how earlier in this project

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.000
we discussed joint ventures with SAIC and EGNG

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
and SAIC in Northrop,

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000
possibly linked to UFO legacy programs?

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Well, SAIC has engaged in similar practices with Imentum.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
A contractor Matt Brown has now accused

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000
of housing UFO materials at Nav Air PAX River.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
SAIC and Imentum join forces to form FSA,

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
a contractor that as recently as 2020

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
has secured IDIQ federal contracts

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000
in excess of $1.3 billion.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Perhaps in the future we can shed more light

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000
on possible joint SAIC Imentum work

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
on UFO legacy programs at major Naval RD-TNE stations.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Anyways, after observing prosaic disruptive technologies,

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Randy and one of his fellow soldiers

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.000
were taken to a pristine and advanced location

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000
under Crane by an unmarked contractor in civilian clothes.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Anderson was told by this guide,

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
a private contractor former military,

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
in the same individual leading the weapons training course,

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
quite nonchalantly,

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
they were entering the quote-unquote

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
off-world technologies division.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Upon entering, Randy did not enter

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
a normal firing range or laboratory.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
He and the other men entered

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000
what seemed to be a scientific observation room

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000
overseeing a laboratory housing two pieces of technology

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
staffed by one other contractor

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
dressed similar to a lab technician.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.000
One device Randy witnessed was a sphere

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
no bigger than a basketball

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
that was seemingly constructed from seamless metal.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
The soldiers were told by their guide

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
this object and the other piece of technology

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
interacted with human consciousness.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
The other piece of technology

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
was seemingly similar to a type of gauntlet

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
that was according to the contractor

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
considered weapon technology

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
due to the tech producing an energetic discharge

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
during recovery.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
This weapon was projecting some type of

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
glyphic writing Randy could not distinguish

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
between physical projection

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
or projection into his mind.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Shortly after, Randy was escorted

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
out of the off-world technologies division

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000
and to this day suffers extensive mental haze

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.000
and memory problems surrounding this event.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.000
But where does SAIC tie into this?

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
The mission of NSWC Crane

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
is to provide the quote American warfighter

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
with solutions to their toughest technical challenges

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
to better equip a decisive advantage

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
in electromagnetic warfare,

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
strategic missions and expeditionary warfare end quote.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Crane employs a whopping

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
2489 contracting force

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
and engages in projects with numerous

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
defense contractors, DOE labs

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000
like Sandia National Labs and universities.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
And also recall as I just mentioned

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
earlier in this project we have already discussed

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
mention of SAIC and many contracts

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
for the JTAA,

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
the Joint Technology Assessment Activity,

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
a key component of Crane that supports

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Advanced Systems and Concepts.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
SAIC, one of the DoD's

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
premier science and technology

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
subject matter experts

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
and innovative contractors,

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
aka Washington Shadow,

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
who has better access to the Pentagon

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
than the government's own attorneys,

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
has extensive contracts of interest

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
with NSWC Crane as well as a provable

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
previous interest in consciousness

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
related studies similar to the

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
sphere Randy observed that

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
reportedly only responded to human consciousness.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Indeed, right around

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
the time of Randy's encounter, 2012,

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
the Office of Naval Research

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
was seemingly carrying on the legacy

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
of SAIC and Stargate,

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
announcing a revolutionary research study

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
that investigated sixth sense

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
among humans to understand how to train

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
personnel on quote,

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
intuitive decision making, end quote.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
But like we've been doing in this video,

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
let's follow the money and analyze

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
some contracts. In my project

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
on joint U.S. Navy under C-UFO

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
retrieval programs, I highlighted

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
joint programs operating between

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
the U.S. Navy, the Office of Naval Research,

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
the Office of Naval Intelligence,

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
U.S. Intelligence agencies such as

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
NRO, NRO, NGA, CIA,

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
as well as US SOCOM

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
or Special Operations Command,

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Defense Contractors, and FFRDC

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
such as the Center for Naval Analysis,

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
MITRE, SAIC,

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute,

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
and Premier U.S. Naval Weapons Facilities

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
such as NSWC Crane

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
and NSWC Chita Lake.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
In that project, which I highly recommend

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
viewing, I discussed how Woods Hole

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Oceanographic Institute provided

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
submersibles for under C-UFO crash

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
retrievals for their quote, unique

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
capabilities that cannot be otherwise

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
obtained, end quote. I theorized

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
this work was conducted through

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
SoulSource, IDIQ, and IDIC

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
engineering service contracts

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
between the National Defense Research and Development

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Services and Woods Hole awarded

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
to Naval Surface Warfare Centers.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Examples can be found

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
between Woods Hole and Newit Keyport

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
for the procurement of quote, hardware,

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
materials, and supplies, as well as

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
services to develop, build, fabricate,

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
integrate, evaluate, and support

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
the unmanned undersea vehicle family

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
of systems for the Naval Undersea

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Warfare Center, end quote.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Indeed, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
even has historical contracts

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
with SAIC at NSWC Crane,

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
such as this 24 May

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
2023 contract for quote,

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
research and development of expeditionary

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
systems for Naval Sea Systems

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Command, Naval Surface Warfare

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Center Crane Weapon System Division

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
JXN, end quote.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Crane's JXN,

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
aka Weapon Systems Division,

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
falls under NSWC Crane's JX

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
or Special Warfare and

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Expeditionary Systems Division.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
This is the department I previously suspected

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
and still suspect holds

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
the Off-World Technologies Division

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
ran by SAIC.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Curiously, there is a 2020 contract

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
of interest here that was deleted

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
from SAIC's website.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
This $133 million contract

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
awarded to SAIC

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
tasked the corporation to continue to provide

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
mission engineering and integration services

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
to the Maneuver Engagement

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
and Surveillance Systems Division

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
at NSWC Crane.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
The Maneuver Surveillance and Engagement Division

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
JXW falls parallel

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
to the Weapon Systems Division JXN

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
that sees joint contracts between

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
SAIC, Woods Hole and Crane,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
both of which fall under the

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
aforementioned Special Warfare

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
and Expeditionary Systems Crane Division.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
In fact, analyzing this

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
JXW Division brings even more

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
intrigue. Nestled within

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
the Maneuver Surveillance and Engagement

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
branch that sees enormous contracts

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
with SAIC is a subset called

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
JXWT.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
The Special Capabilities Branch

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
are elements of the Off-World

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Technologies Division hidden within

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Crane's Special Capabilities Branch.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000
This 2020 $133 million contract

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
may seem obscene, but SAIC

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
is no stranger to frankly

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
enormous contracts.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Earlier in this video, we discussed

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
hundreds of millions of dollars awarded

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
to SAIC for IT

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
consolidation with Sandia National

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Laboratories. But how about

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
this 2023 contract that also

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
suspiciously vanished from

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
SAIC's website around January

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
of 2024, detailing

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
a $249 million

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
in definite delivery

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
in definite quantity, SAIC

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
contract to support Crane's

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Weapons Division Instrumentation Platform?

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
These are but a handful

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
of SAIC Crane contracts.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Numerous more absolutely

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
enormous contracts exist, such as

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
a 2010 $351 million contract

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
for SAIC to provide

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
technical engineering services

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
to NSWC Crane in support

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
of the Joint Special Operations

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Response Department which is

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
referencing JSOC.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
And remember, we've discussed today

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
and as I do in almost every video

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
I link JSOC elements

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
to UFO crash retrieval.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Randy claimed the contractors

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
associated with the classified

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
prosaic weapons training took him to

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
the Off-World Technologies Division.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
We can find even more examples

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
of SAIC conducting weapons

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
testing at Crane. In a now

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
restricted article that was comically

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
pulled after my video on Randy

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Anderson, SAIC demonstrated

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
extensive technical work providing

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
expertise to improve C4 ISR

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
a.k.a. command

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
control, communications, computers,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
in weapon systems for the warfighter

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
at NSWC Crane.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
So if Randy's story is true

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
is SAIC the contractor running

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
the Off-World Technologies Division?

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Well there is no direct proof

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
but I would wager there is ample

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
evidence SAIC with their demonstrated

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
interest in sigh phenomena

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
engagement with assets I have accused

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
of participating in UFO retrieval

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
operations at Crane and proven

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
history engaging in weapons training

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
at Crane single out SAIC

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
as operating an underground

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
laboratory focused on the housing

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
containment and possible exploitation

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
of non human technology.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Anyways, as I said in the beginning of this video

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
I know for SAIC

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
we don't have as many direct

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
connections to UFO programs

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
specifically craft housing

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
and ARV production

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
then we do companies like Northrop

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
like we do Lockheed Morton

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
or even some of Northrop subsidiaries

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
TRW, BDM

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
all the way back to Aerospace etc

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
and then FFRDC's

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
and so on and so forth.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
But I hope what I showed today

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
is that diving through SAIC's

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
corporate history

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
some of their larger scandals

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
some of their implications in UFO

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
programs that this company

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
has for lack of a better term

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
quite a few skeletons in its

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
closet. Whether this be

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
defrauding the United States Government

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
and intelligence agencies or federal

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
forces like virtual case file

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
with the FBI or

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
the FBI

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
or like project trailblazer

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
with the NSA

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
SAIC seems to

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
have a repeating

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
pattern of securing

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
enormous contracts

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
in either delivering no product

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
underdelivering or underdelivering

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
and asking for more money

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
and as we saw from quotes throughout

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
articles published by Forbes

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
and published by Wall Street Journal in the early 2000s

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
there are numerous numerous numerous

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
occasions on which

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
there are anonymous or named whistleblower

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
complaints against SAIC

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
and of course we saw this with Denise McKenzie

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
as well. And I was really

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
interested to kind of connect Aldrich Saussier

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
and his claims of

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
fraud with the SDI

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
the Strategic Defense Initiative and parallel

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
that to 1992 as well

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
with Denise McKenzie and SAIC

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
as we showed in this video

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
SAIC was pretty much the

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
largest contractor for SDI

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
for quite a few years

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
larger than other companies like Northrop Grumman

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Lockheed Martin and so forth combined

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
so by extension

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
I think it is safe to assume that some of this

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
fraud and waste occurring in SDI

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
would extend to its largest

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
by an exponential factor

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
contractor

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
now with SAIC probably what everybody

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
thought going into this video was of course

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Randy Aitterson the Off-World Technologies Division

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
and Project Stargate

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
now I've said

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
so many times and my opinion is really changing

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
on this matter that some of the

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
for lack of a better term

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
psionics or psychic phenomena

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
plural with the UFO programs

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
whether that be cognitively

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
interfacing with a craft

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
in terms of course those claims

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
and some of these beings flying

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
UFOs via mind or via

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
thoughts or headband transceivers

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
some of Leonard Stringfield's notes

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
I have really found

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Solis in the quote by David Grush

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
on JRE

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
where David Grush talks about Stargate

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
and remote viewing documents in the CIA

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
reading room and other various

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
remote viewing programs or AC

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
or AP some of those

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
terms coined by SAIC

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
and I really found Solis

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
and Grush saying to Joe

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
when Joe kind of retorts back well of course

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
the CIA would be looking to gain every single

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
leverage into intelligence

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
gathering whether that be a legitimate source

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
or not that David Grush says

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
well maybe some of these

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
programs spawned out of a need

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
to try and unlock something we have

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
in a warehouse somewhere

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I think that is an extremely interesting quote

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
and that directly kind of

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
corresponds to the story of Randy Anderson

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
in the Off World Technologies division

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
where some of this this sphere

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
that he saw was claimed to

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
interact with human consciousness

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
and how the contractors

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
at NSWC Crane

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
which is most likely and I still

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
maintain and I still maintain even stronger

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
SAIC

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
and I also think it's interesting

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
the larger SAIC connection to some of the

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
larger naval air stations

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
or naval surface warfare centers across the nation

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
I'm intrigued to really

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
dive in more about Matt Brown

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
statements about Patuxent

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
River and the Amentum hangers

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
and explore more of SAIC

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
at Patuxent River maybe NSWC

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Dolgren, China Lake, etc

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
as well as their work with Amentum

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
now looking into the corporate

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
of SAIC I know it's

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
quite convoluted especially when we got

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
into the decision science applications

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
and then that long

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
road of DSAI going into

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
DSA to Stephen Myers

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
to L3 communications to

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Engility to being bought up by SAIC

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
and L3 airs I know

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
that's crazy complicated I was

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
really interested to find sort of

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
similar to Triad National Security

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
with Battelle and two universities

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
that SAIC engaged in

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
similar practices and this was

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
with their RDS with

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
EG&G now of course

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
the LLC went defunct within a couple

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
years but similar to Triad

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
this was a crack

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
to break into DOE

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
lab work and Department of Energy

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
classified work but

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
I think one of the most tangible things we have

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
from today's video some of the most tangible

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
research is of course the SAIC

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
whistleblowers I

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
do not need to say more about

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I'm sure by the time this video comes out

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
there will be a lot of stink about the Wall Street Journal article

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
and

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
maybe even we'll get that part too soon

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
so I'd like to see more of

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
more of basically a hero worship

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
tale to Sean Kirkpatrick and his great work

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
but I'd also like to ask

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
if Kona Blue was just a project

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
tricking all Air Force personnel

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
what about the circular reporting

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
those two seem at odds with each other from

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Kirkpatrick's claims but anyway I digress

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
I do believe we stumbled upon some other

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
high-level SAIC gatekeepers

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
and possibly

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
individuals that need to be subpoenaed by Congress

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
of course most of these individuals are

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
ceased but some are still living

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
these gatekeeper individuals include

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
John M. Deutch, William J. Perry

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Admiral Ray Bourne

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Admiral Owens

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
and Donald Kerr

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
I'd say of all of these individuals

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Donald Kerr's CV

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
has the greatest

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
greatest CV and greatest

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
work history that would lend to UFO legacy

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
programs this being CIA, DS&T

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
SAIC

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
NRO, the MITRE Corporation

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
etc. I'd be real interested

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
to hear from more about

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Don Kerr's work in legacy program operations

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
and gosh

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
I'd be really interested to speak to Oki Shannon

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
as well of course we saw in the ATP

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
notes from 85 we see look to Don

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Kerr for influence and money

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
and earlier in

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
those notes I didn't include this in the video

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
there's Don K slash

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
dash ET with a couple other names

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
now is this Don

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Kerr most likely and why

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
ET was there other information

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
spoken about Don Kerr at this

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
advanced theoretical physics working group

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
at BDM's facility in McLean, Virginia

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
that was held one year

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
after Stubblebine joined BDM

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
I would certainly like to know more

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
and also I know I said

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
earlier in the video that I have found Denise

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
McKenzie in attempted to main contact

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I've heard nothing yet

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I'd really like to speak to her to learn more

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I've also found Mr. Stuart Stanley

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
and I've tried to reach out to him

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
nothing yet either so

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
kind of the running theme with this video

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
and as we said in the beginning SAIC

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
has really seemed to stay in the shadows

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
why that is

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
I think they've really maintained a lower profile

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
than companies like Northrop Grumman

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
and Lockheed Martin and maintained a lower profile

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
than even some of the other low profile guys

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
like DNA, like Rand

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
etc

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
so I hope if anything this video just brings to light

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
some of the involvement of SAIC

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
and not only just do a full legacy programs

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
but also black budget operations

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
and some secretive work

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
I mean SAIC

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
from its inception

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
being staffed with high level individuals

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
such as Bobby Ray Inman has had

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
numerous

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
numerous high level intelligence and military individuals

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
the way this has been explained to me in the past

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
as some individuals who work in UFO

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
legacy programs within the DOD

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
or IC

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
they'll trade in their stripes and stars for a pinstripe suit

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
and essentially

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
these guys will go from working on UFO

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
legacy programs within official

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
United States government and DOD avenues

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
and intelligence avenues

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
to doing the same thing on a corporate payroll

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
and you'd imagine

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
with a lot of these gatekeepers we talked about

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Sean Kirkpatrick included

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
a lot of these guys would either go on to work at SAIC

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
after

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
service in the U.S. DOD or IC

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
or before

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
worked in SAIC

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
this reminds me of John Doichu

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
before he joined the

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
joined us DepsecDef

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
and spearheaded SAPOC SRG

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
and SAPOC itself

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
he was already on the board of SAIC

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
and already working with TRW

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
and how about that I know in the Northrop video

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
we talked quite a bit about TRW

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
TRW was of course purchased by Lockheed Martin

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
in the early 2000s and

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
another connection to the Wilson Davis notes

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
TRW had also been

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
kind of

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
convicted and pursued legally for

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
overcharging on space

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
systems on space projects by the

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
U.S. DOD in the early 90s

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
and in that Northrop project I kind of

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
tied that together

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
with some of the near out auditing

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
that almost found out some of the

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
DOD UAP legacy programs

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
so that's interesting as well that so many of these individuals

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
also have connections to TRW

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
of course with TRW

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
have the old Zodiac story and so forth

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
by pseudonym Sedgemasters

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Richard Dolan's done some incredible

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
work on that I'd love to work with him someday

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
to revisit Zodiac

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
but I'll leave my rant there

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
I do hope again that this is a springboard

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
for more research into

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
SAIC UFO legacy programs

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
I would like to hear more stories

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
of

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
ARV and SAIC tied together

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
and I would like to hear more material

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
exploitation programs and craft housing

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
because

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
I'm going to say this in the end of my videos every time

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
if you are

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
an individual who has had

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
experience first hand

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
or have second hand knowledge on UFO legacy programs

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
this be crash retrieval or material exploitation

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
please

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
email me at UAPGIRB

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
at protonmail.com

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
I've switched away from a Gmail account

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
I've had some wise advice that this wouldn't

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
necessarily be a secure method to receive such

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
communication so UAPGIRB

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
at protonmail.com

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
and guys please remember to like and subscribe

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000

every view every comment helps tremendously

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
and like I say in

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
every single video I do have a Patreon

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
I don't gate keep content there's nothing

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
special on there that you won't get for free

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
here but

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
I say that to support the channel

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
for what you think it's worth

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
but again no content gate kept there

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
a lot of exciting projects coming up

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
maybe one interview I'm going to do that

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
I would really really like to do

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
but this just the first project

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
in a long list of many

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
new projects with the revitalized setup

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
with continued

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
attempts to get better at

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
recording editing and so forth so

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
we'll always put my best foot forward for you guys

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
again remember to like and subscribe

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
join the Patreon if you think it's

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
