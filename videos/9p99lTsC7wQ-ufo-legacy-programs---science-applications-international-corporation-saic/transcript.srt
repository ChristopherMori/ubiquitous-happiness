1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Before the first soldier sets foot on the battlefield,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
before the first recon flight takes off, SAIC is there.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Helping the Army and Air Force transform opportunities into solutions for diverse missions,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
from mission command capabilities to enterprise IT systems,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and modeling, simulation and training.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We work side by side with our customers to develop field and sustain critical capabilities

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
for our nation's soldiers and airmen.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
SAIC focused on mission success.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, that's one of those big Pentagon contractors.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Those of us who believe there is UFO information and craft and materials stashed,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
suspect that SAIC would be one of the likely candidates to get that stuff.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's right in the heart of the larger conspiracy lore.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In fact, I think that was the testimony.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is an alien reproduction vehicle, and just to be clear,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
this means that it is based on advanced anti-gravity and zero-point energy propulsion systems.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Those are the propulsion systems.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They are being manufactured by a consortium of companies that include Lockheed Martin,

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Northrop, SAIC and other corporations.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
James Defense Weekly, the popular military defense publication,

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
published an article about SAIC,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and there's a post script to the article that anyone who believes in the science of anti-gravity

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
to be too arcane, too esoteric,

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
even for the U.S. Air Force should consider the Electric Propulsion Study

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
undertaken by SAIC for the Astronautics Laboratory, which is now part of the Phillips Lab.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The study's primary objective was to outline physical methods

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to test theories of inductive coupling between electromagnetic and gravitational forces

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to determine the feasibility of such methods as they apply to space propulsion,

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and in simplified terms, an anti-gravity propulsion system.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It remains for some the ultimate quantum leap.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
On this channel, I have discussed numerous DOD contractors

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and federally funded research and development centers

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
with strong ties and paper trails to UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
After all, the research conducted by myself and scores of other researchers over the decades

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
have on countless occasions directly accused the U.S. Department of Defense

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and Intelligence community of working in tandem with defense contractors,

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
FFRDCs and UARCs to reverse engineer exotic technologies of unknown origin,

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
protected by special access and unacknowledged special access programs.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Overall, you know, the government has been the custodian of a lot of this, right,

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and they'll hand recede it out to a clear defense contractor to do some analysis,

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
which I find highly unethical.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You have basically a sole-source arrangement,

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and you allow certain private corporate elements to look at this, develop a potential insight,

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and then sell it back to the government for profit,

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and I think that's totally unethical.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Whether this be Northrop Grumman in tales of legacy programs

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
under the Tejon radar site under Antelope Valley,

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Lockheed Martin and accusations of constructing the TR-3B reverse-engineered alien reproduction vehicle,

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Battelle Memorial Institute and declassified studies of shape-memory alloys

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
possibly originating from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
or the Aerospace Corporation and MITRE Corporation,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
both founded between 1959 to 1960,

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
allegedly to exploit technologies of unknown origin.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Much of our work on this channel is spent analyzing the private or semi-private sectors.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Today, I want to dive back into the corporate world

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
to cover an enormous DOD contractor and defense and technology corporation

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
that I believe may in fact be even more intimately entwined

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
with UFO legacy program operations and security

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
over any other American defense contractor,

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Science Applications International Corporation.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Many viewing this video will recognize SAIC

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
as we will call it from here on out as a usual, tricky customer of this channel.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No longer a piece of lost media.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Back on 17 July 2024, long before his excellent interview on Jesse Michaels,

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I relayed the testimony of former US Army Green Beret Randy Anderson

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and accused SAIC as the contractor running the Off-World Technologies division

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
beneath the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane in Indiana.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Today, I'm happy to announce I will be re-releasing that investigation

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and while I highly recommend viewing that research in its entirety,

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
the first time Randy spoke publicly about his encounter,

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
we will cover his story again today in brief or detail.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The trail of SAIC and UFO legacy programs is not as clear cut and glamorous

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
as any contractor or FFRDC we have covered before on this channel.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But by studying SAIC, I strongly believe we gain invaluable insights

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
into UFO legacy program funding, infrastructure, modus operandi, secrecy, and more.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So for this investigation, we will break up our research into five main areas of study,

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
black-budget moneys, legacy program gatekeeping,

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
sigh research, technologies of unknown origin, and material slash craft housing.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
At the end of this investigation, we should be able to make sense of some interesting questions

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
such as, what should we make of Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick's former position

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
as senior research scientist for SAIC in 2000 pre-Aero?

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What can we learn from former SAIC employee Denise McKinsey

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
who discussed obfuscation of funds on enormous defense contracts?

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Why has SAIC historically conducted endless advanced propulsion and human psychic research?

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And does SAIC really run divisions storing non-human artifacts

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
below some of the United States premier weapon centers?

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And their involvement in UFO legacy program operations,

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
often called the NSA West, I believe SAIC and their decades of cutting edge,

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
compartmentalized science and technology contracts

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
as well as intimate ties with senior DOD and intelligence community personnel,

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
highlight a contractor entrenched in UFO legacy programs at the highest level.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
SAIC is a bit of a black box.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Much of what it does is proprietary or even top secret.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So it's hard to tell whether what SAIC provides is necessary and effective.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
To understand SAIC and its corporate structure

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that lends perfectly to an institution entwined with U.S. Department of Defense

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and intelligence community deep sixth black budget special access programs,

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
we must first step back and analyze the history of SAIC.

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Science applications was born in 1969 from Dr. J. Robert Baster.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Baster served in the U.S. Navy during World War II

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
before earning his PhD in nuclear physics in 1950.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The doctor's skills were immediately put to work

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
for the Westinghouse Atomic Power Division on the nuclear submarine program.

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Baster would then join Los Alamos National Labs

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
as a research physicist before joining General Atomics

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
as the chair of the accelerator physics department.

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Quote, I was not the brilliant flash of inspiration type of entrepreneur

107
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and quote Baster would state,

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
rather he was more of a quote unquote persistent builder type.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Come 3 February 1969, Baster would start SAIC

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
immediately stacking the company with General Atomic Scientist

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and created one of the first employee owned companies

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He made it a priority to ensure that every employee owned a part of the new company

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
even using employee ownership as recruitment and retention tool.

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Staff were expected to perform superior scientific and technical work

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
while also playing a key role in the management and direction of the company.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
SAIC's internal stock ownership program

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
which promised to make government officials rich after they left public service

118
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
allowed Baster to immediately pack the payroll with specialist and subject matter experts

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
but also with generals, diplomats, spies and cabinet officers

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
SAIC's board and high level workforce was

121
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
from the company's inception staffed with high level military

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and intelligence personnel with unprecedented access

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to lucrative contracts and special access programs.

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Quote, they had better access to the Pentagon

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
than the government's own attorneys, end quote.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Some of these acquisitions included the illustrious Bobby Ray Inman

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Navy Admiral, NSA Director and CIA Deputy Director

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
John M. Deutsch, Under Secretary of Defense

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
under President Jimmy Carter and CIA Director

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
under President Bill Clinton

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Rear Admiral William F. Raybourne

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
who headed development of the Polaris submarine program

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and many many many more personnel

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We will address all of these figures and more

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
such as Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick in our SAIC gatekeepers section.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Indeed SAIC's ventures were so successful out of the gate

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Baster's very first government contracts came from the Defense Atomic Support Agency

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
where the company was tasked with calculating the output of nuclear devices

139
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
By the mid-2000s SAIC achieved unrivaled success

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
in government science and technology contracting

141
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
specializing as Vanity Fair once said in 2007 as a quote

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Body shop in the brain business

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It sells human beings who have a particular expertise

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Expertise about weapons, about homeland security

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
about surveillance, about computer systems

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
about information dominance and information warfare, end quote.

147
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
By 2007 SAIC and its two major offices in San Diego, California

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and Washington DC ballooned to the size of an entire government agency

149
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
featuring a workforce of over 44,000

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
larger than the manpower of the departments of labor, energy

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and housing and urban development combined at that time

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Current day outside of their major offices

153
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
SAIC maintains countless locations across the continental United States

154
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
many of which are near U.S. military installations

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
or RDT&E facilities

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
such as the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, Indiana

157
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
China Lake Naval Air Station, California

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Sandia National Labs, New Mexico

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and Crystal City, Virginia

161
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Similar to Northrop Grumman and their acquisition of contractors

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
such as TRW and Teledyne Ryan

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and connections to federally funded research and development centers

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
such as the Aerospace Corporation

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
SAIC exhibits a similar, intriguing history of acquisitions, mergers

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
associations, etc.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
One such corporation, allegedly spun from SAIC

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
is DSAI Decision Science Applications Inc.

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
founded in Virginia on 4 January 1977

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
DSAI operated as an employee-owned quote

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
technical services company with expertise in military command and control systems

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
commercial information management systems

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
software development, electrical engineering

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
telecommunications and physics, end quote

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
According to some previous whistleblowers

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
such as the controversial Colonel Steve Wilson

177
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
DSAI and SAIC were one in the same

178
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
with DSAI featuring a board consisting of the directors

179
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
of relevant UFO Black Budget divisions

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
including IBM, Lockheed, Teledyne Ryan

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Aerojet Electro Systems, etc.

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Wilson would also claim Bobby Ray Inman

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
a reoccurring figure on this channel

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and member of the board of directors of SAIC

185
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
also ran DSAI

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
To learn more about Wilson

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I do recommend checking out my video on Northrop Grumman

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and UFO Legacy Program Operations

189
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I will not waste much time here

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
by reviewing his whistleblower claims again

191
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Let's still briefly mention a handful of Wilson's claims

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and why he is relevant to today's project

193
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Wilson would disclose to Dr. Richard Boylan

194
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
a UFO researcher with many publications

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I approach with skepticism that he, Wilson

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
was not only stationed at Area 51 S4

197
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
where reverse engineered anti-gravity vehicles were tested

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
but that he also spearheaded Project Pounce

199
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
an elite Air Force National Reconnaissance Organization

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Special Forces Unit which retrieved downed UFOs

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
with elements of JSOC, specifically Delta Force

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Project Pounce can be observed in the disputed

203
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Majestic-12 Project Aquarius document

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and, oddly enough, the 1953 Robertson Panel Report

205
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Remember, the Robertson Panel served as a debunking panel

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
to reduce public concern regarding UFOs

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Wilson would claim the first successful flight

208
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
of man-made anti-gravity alien reproduction vehicles

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
had occurred on 18 July 1971

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
which saw Admiral Bobby Ray Inman present for the test

211
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Inman, still at the Navy at this time

212
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
would go on to serve as the director of the NSA

213
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
deputy director of the CIA

214
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
vice director of the DIA

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
director of Naval Intelligence

216
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and board member of SAIC in the 1980s

217
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Wilson's disclosures are indeed intriguing

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
but should of course be taken with some skepticism

219
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
therefore I do recommend also reading a more skeptical take

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
on Wilson written by Kevin Randall

221
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But relevant to our discussion is Wilson's map of Star Wars City

222
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
an illustration depicting UFO legacy program operations

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
conducted covertly within the Strategic Defense Initiative

224
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
also known as SDI created in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan

225
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This SDI program will be discussed again in our project

226
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
in much greater detail so please hang tight

227
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Within this chart are numerous institutions

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
one might expect to be associated with

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
UFO retrieval and exploitation programs

230
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
the NRO, the National Security Council

231
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
the National Security Agency

232
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
CIA, NORAD and Majestic 12

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Adhering to the SDI Colorado HQ and Magi

234
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
there exists a list of contractors alleged to engage with the UFO portfolio

235
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
alongside the 1010 Special Security Squadron

236
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
which quote provides a high level of protection to NORAD, US Spacecom

237
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and AF Spacecom resources located at the mountain

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Contractors such as Rockwell, Martin Marietta, Lockheed, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and IBM are mentioned

239
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Wilson would state one contractor paramount to the SDI UFO programs

240
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
was Decision Science Applications, Inc.

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But here is where things get really interesting

242
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We don't have concrete evidence

243
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
DSAI was spawned from SAIC though it is likely

244
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
However, we can analyze the evolution of DSAI

245
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I would like to thank Reddit user StillChillTrill for this incredible work

246
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
His account is now deleted but I will still link to his excellent posts

247
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
In 1998, DSAI executed a merger into a company called DSA Acquisitions, Inc.

248
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that was then purchased by Stephen Myers & Associates for almost $31 million in cash and stock

249
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
By 21 August of that year, Stephen Myers & Associates finalized their acquisition of DSAI-DSA

250
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Stephen Myers & Associates eventually acquired Emergent Information Technologies, Inc.

251
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and SMNA changed its name to Emergent Information Technologies

252
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
On 6 December 2001, Emergent Information Technologies

253
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
sold its Virginia-based government services group to L3 Communications

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
L3 Harris, formerly known as L3 Communications, is another defense contractor

255
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
that has both worked alongside SAIC for enormous defense contracts

256
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and is a contractor I have been informed works directly in UFO legacy program operations

257
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But to fully complete this circle, in July of 2012

258
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
a part of L3 Communications aka L3 Harris spun off into its own publicly traded company called Angility

259
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
In 2018, SAIC purchased Angility for $2.5 billion

260
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So regardless of if DSAI was spawned from SAIC

261
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
eventually, DSAI assets made their way to SAIC

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and another defense contractor highly likely involved in UFO legacy operations, L3 Harris

263
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But if that wasn't already difficult enough to track

264
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
incredibly convoluted corporate structures are commonplace with SAIC

265
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
On 27 September 2013, SAIC created a $4 billion spin-off

266
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
retaining the name SAIC while transforming its name to LATOS

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The primary reason for this spin-off was quote

268
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
conflicts of interest provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation

269
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
which prevented the company from bidding on some new contracts because of existing contracts

270
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
end quote

271
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So essentially SAIC had so many contracts and was so big

272
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
it had to split up to gain more

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So just to point out, when I refer to SAIC

274
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I am referring to both SAIC and LATOS

275
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
but this gets even more interesting

276
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
On 16 August 2016, LATOS merged with Lockheed Martin Information Systems

277
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and Global Solutions that saw LATOS acquire this Lockheed division for $5 billion

278
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And in an additional interesting event

279
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
on 30 November 2017, Lockheed Martin Services Inc. changed their name to LATOS Government Services Inc.

280
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
After the creation of LATOS, SAIC announced acquisition of Skeetor Holdings

281
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
a defense and space manufacturing contractor with specific expertise in intelligence

282
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
for $790 million

283
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This purchase was completed in an all-caste transaction

284
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and retained the majority of original Skeetor employees

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
According to a 2008 book, Spies for Intelligence by Tim Shorok

286
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Skeetor was a critical contractor for the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology

287
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
for Satellite Signals Intelligence and Electronic Intelligence

288
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The CIA Directorate of Science and Technology, or DS&T, is a commonplace subject on this channel

289
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
serving as a legacy UFO program office that in 2002 spawned the CIA Office of Global Access

290
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Excellent journalist Chris Sharp, myself, and others have accused the Office of Global Access, or OGA

291
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
as participating in foreign UFO crash retrieval operations

292
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I have additionally, when discussing U.S. Navy, UFO, foreign material, acquisition, and exploitation programs

293
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
discussed the CIA, DS&T, alongside the NRO, Nuro, SOCOM, Department of Energy, and more

294
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
operating worldwide under-sea UFO retrieval operations

295
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I have quite a few projects to learn more about the CIA, DS&T

296
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
so go check out any of these projects in the video description

297
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Perhaps SAIC took note of Skeetor for their expertise in MASSINT, or Measurement and Signals Intelligence

298
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
a highly classified form of intelligence, quote

299
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
that uses infrared heat imaging, acoustic signatures, seismic data, and other information

300
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
picked up by air and ground sensors to sniff out for weapons tests and other activities

301
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
that other countries want to hide from the United States, end quote

302
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
MASSINT collection is primarily managed by the DIA and used extensively by the CIA

303
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:07,000
In 2005, Skeetor held a national symposium on MASSINT signature technology with contractors involved such as BAE Systems and, of course, SAIC

304
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
After all, according to spies for hire, quote, Skeetor may be unknown, but it is definitely not a small player, end quote

305
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Also consider me curious and possibly suspicious that Skeetor's old building in Chant Till, Virginia, 14660 Lee Road, to be specific

306
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:35,000
resides in the same corporate park with SAIC, the Aerospace Corporation, an FFRDC I have accused directly as having decades of UFO program involvement

307
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and the NRO

308
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
SAIC's acquisitions and partnerships are indeed indicative of a contractor entwined with UFO legacy program operations

309
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Later in this project, we will explore this even further, such as SAIC's relationship with EG&G

310
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The contractor Bob Lazar claimed hired him to reverse engineer UFO propulsion systems at Area 51S4

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Equally intriguing as SAIC's acquisitions are the corporation's intimate ties with US intelligence and NAC for war profiteering

312
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:15,000
From its inception, SAIC enjoyed high-level former intelligence officials on its board, but I would also like to reference a 2018 Baltimore Sun article titled

313
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Little-known contractor has close ties with staff of NSA

314
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This article, along with the excellent book The Shadow Factory by James Bamford, detail how SAIC basically became, quote unquote,

315
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
A revolving door between the NSA and SAIC

316
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Interesting here as the National Security Agency or NSA is one of the US's big five intelligence agencies alongside the NRO, CIA, DIA, NGA, NRO, and likely the Hidden Neuro

317
00:21:46,000 --> 00:22:01,000
In numerous programs, I have implicated the NSA and UFO legacy program operations from enforcing gatekeeping in the form of treat or the tactical reconnaissance engineering assessment team to management of ARV programs such as the TR3B

318
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:15,000
As a side note, an unnamed retired Army Public Affairs Officer friend of mine who brushed up against legacy programs told me he was not frightened by the CIA but was terrified of the behemoth that was the NSA

319
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And later on, we will discuss possible avenues of black-budget monies conducted between SAIC and the NSA, so hold tight

320
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Keep in mind during our investigation that SAIC is an eligible contractor under the DOD's Corporate Portfolio Program

321
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The Corporate Portfolio Program gives defense industrial-based corporations like SAIC access to DOD executives, scientists, and management with broad access to special access programs

322
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The Corporate Portfolio Program framework was established in 2020 under then US Undersecretary for Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Ellen Lord

323
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:00,000
In an almost comical sequence of events, Lord would join SAIC's advisory board in July 2021

324
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And as we progress in this investigation, I find it prudent to mention SAIC is accustomed to getting their way however and whenever they want

325
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Whether this be in the form of acquisitions, enormous sole-source contracts, or war profiteering efforts, many viewers on this channel are familiar with the cries of weapons of mass destruction that fueled the logic behind the Iraq war

326
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Now did you know, SAIC executives were involved at every stage of the Iraq war life cycle

327
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Indeed, quote, SAIC personnel were instrumental in pressing the case that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq in the first place, and that the war was the only way to get rid of them

328
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And when no weapons of mass destruction were found, SAIC personnel staffed the commission that was set up to investigate how American intelligence could have been so disastrously wrong

329
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Just to provide some further context here, in 1998 David Key, Weapons Expert and Director of SAIC's Center for Counterterrorism Technology and Analysis,

330
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Saddam Hussein, quote, remains in power with weapons of mass destruction, end quote

331
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Following the Iraq war, President Bush appointed a commission to analyze how American intelligence managed to, quote, miss the truth about Iraq's weapons programs, end quote

332
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:29,000
The commission published a report just one year later, absolving policymakers and US intelligence from distorting evidence of Iraq's WMDs

333
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The commission had direct ties to SAIC, including Gordon Uller, SAIC VP for Corporate Development, Jeffrey R. Cooper, VP for Technology and Chief Science Officer of one of SAIC's major subunits, and Samuel S. Visner

334
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
SAIC VP and Director of Strategic Planning and Business Development for SAIC's Intelligence Group

335
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And now that we have finally set the stage for SAIC and UFO legacy programs, let's begin to dive in

336
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You can say categorically you've seen no convincing, confirmable evidence of intact spacecraft kept by the US government

337
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
No, I have seen nothing that leads me to that conclusion

338
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Is it possible there is some secret program that you're just not aware of?

339
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I don't think so. I have access to anything and everything I need

340
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And the way you combat conspiracy theories and the associated misunderstandings that fuel them is a fact in science and truth

341
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So if you've got evidence for conspiracy, then that helps to investigate what the underlying truth is

342
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
There has been none that has been substantiated for this

343
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And everything that has been brought to our attention and everything that was brought to my attention when I was in that position as the director

344
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We investigated and discovered that it did not come from where they thought it came from

345
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Most everything was explainable through other documentation, other programs, other people that had talked to other people

346
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Washington Shadow, NSA West, whatever you want to call it

347
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
SAIC has served as a revolving door for high level US Department of Defense personnel

348
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Since the company's inception, SAIC was aggressively packed with, quote,

349
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Former generals, admirals, diplomats, spies, and cabinet officers of every kind to fill the company's board of directors and the upper echelons of its staff, end quote

350
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:45,000
With such high level staff, it is no surprise there are numerous accused high level gatekeepers to UFO legacy programs with aggressive and shocking ties to SAIC

351
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Let's reflect on Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, former head of the Pentagon's all-domain anomaly resolution office

352
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I certainly hold no love for Kirkpatrick, and I wait for many viewers of this channel share the same sentiment

353
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:09,000
When I was in USDI, I read the transcripts of Sean Kirkpatrick briefing Senator Rubio, Senator Warren, and Senator Gillibrand on the results of his investigation in his

354
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Congressionally-tasked Arrow report, and those transcripts which were supposed to be open kimono

355
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Here's the truth, Mr. Senator, Mr. Senator, Sean Kirkpatrick, absolutely distorted, downplayed, and can't prove it, but I would say outright lied to the people who have direct responsibility for him

356
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Saying what? What did he say? It was a lie

357
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So it's more of a lie of the whole big picture, the big picture, right? In the meeting it's, you know, Congressman Rubio, we've heard about this incident

358
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We just don't have enough data to go on it to really know what this is. We don't have any way of really figuring out what's going on

359
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It could just be an anomaly. In fact, it's most likely anomaly. So starting with an acknowledgement that, you know, you have some data, but we have the insight and the scientific expertise to make you feel at ease

360
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Nothing to see here, folks, moving on

361
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Exactly. Although there was also political discussion involved in historic discussion, and, you know, I read these transcripts once, and immediately knew that

362
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Uh, yeah

363
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Veiled threat?

364
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:40,000
No, I knew that I was now something else. I was, I had inside knowledge into the deception of our government by elements of our intelligence community

365
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Under Kirkpatrick, Arrow released the abysmal Arrow historical report volume one, which outright lied about some witness testimony

366
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:02,000
This was proven, for example, by Michael Herrera's official Arrow memorandum for record, which showed Herrera did not claim to encounter an extraterrestrial spaceship or US special forces as falsely outlined in the Arrow report

367
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Arrow under the direction of Dr. Kirkpatrick additionally in 2022 engaged in DOD contracts with contractor Sand Corp, a company with a speciality in plugging whistleblower leaks

368
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I have also in the past shown ties with Kirkpatrick and his good buddy Ronald Moultrie, former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security and board member of both Battelle Memorial Institute and the Meiter Corporation and how Kirkpatrick and Moultrie enjoy debunking claims of UFOs at previous Arrow roundtables

369
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The guy that formed Arrow upon whose recommendation Arrow was formed is a guy named Ed Moultrie who is Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and he was on Battelle's board and he scrubbed that from his LinkedIn

370
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And my good friend, UAP Gerb, who is an amazing channel, he's a super deep UFO researcher, showed that it was on his resume and then he recommends that Arrow formed, it's like a total conflict of interest, it's insane, it's insane

371
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Kirkpatrick during his time at Arrow and post Arrow has frequently engaged in dismissing any and all whistleblower claims, often resorting to emotionally charged outbursts

372
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You believe them?

373
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I believe that they believe what they're telling me and I, my job is not to, it's not a question of belief, right, it's a question of what can I go research

374
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:36,000
There is absolutely nothing that I'm going to do say or produce evidentiary that is going to make the true believers convert, if you will

375
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's almost like a religion, it is basically a religion

376
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Myself and others have wagered Kirkpatrick served and possibly still serves as a gatekeeper for UFO legacy programs

377
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:58,000
This sentiment was shared by witness Ed of the 412th Test Wing who refused to testify to Arrow under Kirkpatrick as according to Ed, Kirkpatrick is an insider meant to squash information

378
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The doctor's employment history pre and post Arrow is additionally intriguing, the good doctor has filed many patents including 2022 and 2023 patents for quote

379
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
System and methods for determining influence of channels in a social network, end quote

380
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But that is not our interest today, no instead it is Sean Kirkpatrick's former patents with SAIC including a 2003 filing for quote

381
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Holographic recording and micro slash nano fabrication via ultra fast holographic two photon induced photopolymerization, H-T-P-I-P, end quote

382
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Between joining the NRO and CIA in 2003 and 2005 respectively and working within the Air Force Research Laboratory in 1997, Kirkpatrick worked at SAIC as a senior research scientist

383
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
We can specifically review work for SAIC as a senior research scientist in the year 2000

384
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Now how interesting is that a senior SAIC scientist went on to spearhead a questionable office in Arrow that was originally supposed to be called the UAP JPO which some have called Project Blue Book 2.0

385
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Now flashback to 1987, SAIC had previously conducted some of Sean Kirkpatrick's favorite type of science for the DOE, aspects of turbulence and non-linear solutions

386
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Shortly after leaving both the Pentagon and Arrow Kirkpatrick began his own LLC called non-linear solutions

387
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:34,000
As of 1 January 2025, non-linear solutions has been subcontracted by the MITRE Corporation

388
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:44,000
An FFRDC I have spoken about ad nauseum on this channel for DOD indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts for US space com

389
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The description of this MITRE contract reads, quote, award of indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for National Security Engineering Center Federally Funded Research and Development Center FFRDC, end quote

390
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:14,000
The NSAC run by MITRE in McLean, Virginia operates to, quote, provide the US and its allies and partners with the ability to anticipate and solve the most consequential national security problems requiring integration across missions, capabilities, organizations, and nations, end quote

391
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I do wonder what sort of support non-linear solutions can offer as a subcontractor for MITRE under US space com here, but Kirkpatrick did have previous experience with space com, serving as the intelligence community lead for a US space com task force in 2018 to 2019

392
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Now I mention that to recall back to September 2024 when excellent researcher TAG underscore OM recovered FOIA documents from US space com dated 31 January 2023

393
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:54,000
These documents outlined a briefing conducted by Kirkpatrick to high level DOD attendees on, quote, UAP response and recovery and material transfer, end quote

394
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I do sure wonder what non-linear solutions and MITRE plan to do with US space com

395
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:17,000
In December 2023 Kirkpatrick also joined Oak Ridge National Laboratory as the chief technology officer for defense and intelligence programs. Oak Ridge is of course a DOE sponsored FFRDC administered by Battelle Memorial Institute

396
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:29,000
These are patterns we simply cannot ignore. Why is a former SAIC senior research scientist so intimately involved with FFRDCs and UARC institutions?

397
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I commonly connect to UFO programs after his tenure as the DOD's mouthpiece to debunk UFO information with Arrow

398
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Let us now transition to the most legendary testimony of gatekeeping UFO legacy programs in history, the Wilson Davis memo

399
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So in this video in the interest of time I will assume the viewer has some knowledge of the Wilson Davis meeting notes so if you don't go check out my first ever video on this channel

400
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's a little rough but still gets the message across

401
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:08,000
In short these disputed but highly likely accurate notes transcribed by Dr. Eric Davis leaked from the estate of the late astronaut Edgar Mitchell

402
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:19,000
These notes recount a 2002 conversation between Davis and Vice Admiral and former DIA director Thomas Wilson outside of the parking lot of contractor EG&G in Nevada

403
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,000
The conversation recounts Wilson finding but being stonewalled in accessing UFO recovery and material exploitation programs

404
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Protected by the DOD Special Access Program Oversight Committee, SAPOC, Senior Review Group, SRG and a large defense contractor I-Wager might in fact be SAIC

405
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:49,000
According to Wilson he was informed by General Michael Ward to search a special records group in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology

406
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Belonging to special legacy holdover programs from before special access program restructuring efforts in the early 1990s

407
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:05,000
In the memo UFO programs were reorganized under SAPOC SRG after an internal audit almost revealed the programs

408
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:19,000
This SAPOC reorganization began on 5 January 1994 when the Deputy Secretary of Defense significantly enhanced and strengthened changes in the DOD Special Access Program SAP management and control structure

409
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
This newsletter on screen now highlights those changes establishing the Senior Review Group

410
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:39,000
We can also possibly find some useful data. In the GAO's May 1993 report titled, quote, DOD Special Access Program's administrative due process not provided when access is denied or revoked, end quote

411
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Which discusses the Navy and Air Force not complying with DOD regulation 6200.2 slash R which discussed special access program access

412
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I did find it interesting that between the Army, Air Force, and Navy it was in fact the Army that did comply in some cases for SAP regulations according to this GAO document

413
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And according to some of my research this makes sense to me as well as I am familiar with cases in which the US Army seemed to operate UFO material exploitation programs in a strict controlled environment with oversight

414
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
While Navy and Air Force legacy programs seemed to operate far more loosely and out of control

415
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But let's take a deeper look at the SAPOC in its Senior Review Group that was upon its creation by the Deputy Secretary of Defense tasked with gatekeeping UFO legacy programs according to VA DM Wilson

416
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Around the time of this restructuring, the SAPOC was chaired by Deputy Secretary of Defense the Honorable John Deutch. Mind you, John Deutch did not restructure SAPOC as DEP SECDEF

417
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
This was conducted by his predecessor William Perry, but Deutch immediately followed suit in the role

418
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Immediately pre his position chairing SAPOC as the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Deutch served as the Under Secretary of Defense for acquisition and technology

419
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
The same office Wilson learned contained UFO legacy files

420
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Now, Deutch here is very interesting. Based upon the testimony of VA DM Wilson, we can conclude with a high degree of certainty Deutch served as a gatekeeper for UFO legacy programs

421
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Deutch served as a Director of Central Intelligence, a professor at MIT, enjoyed numerous positions within the DOE

422
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And also served as a consultant pre-work on SAPOC with TRW, Los Alamos National Labs, and MITRE, three institutions I directly accuse of being involved in UFO programs

423
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But that's not all. Pre-1995, possibly during his tenure as DEP SECDEF and within the AUSDAT, Deutch served as the Director of SAIC

424
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And even worked in SAIC's La Jolla office, the same office of Denise McKenzie

425
00:38:48,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So, here's what we're left with. According to Wilson, the reorganization of SAPOC and creation of the senior review group directly served to gatekeeper UFO legacy programs from even a three star admiral and DIA director

426
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:15,000
DEP SECDEF William J. Perry conducted such a reorganization in February of 1994 and immediately one month after a new DEP SECDEF is assigned and put in charge as chairman of SAPOC

427
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
This being a former SAIC director

428
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But that's not all. To put the real cherry on top here, even William J. Perry himself who reorganized SAPOC in 1994 once served on the board of SAIC

429
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
One could be chance, two as a pattern, so let's extend this further

430
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,000
During his investigations, Vice Admiral Wilson spoke to two permanent members of the Special Access Program Oversight Committee

431
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Brigadier General Mike Kostanik and Paul Kaminsky, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, preceded by Deutch

432
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Kaminsky and permanent senior review group member Lynn Wells are both lifelong MITRE Corporation members, but I digress

433
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:04,000
A permanent SAPOC member post-SAP restructuring is Admiral William A. Owens, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

434
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Outside of his prestigious naval career and service as senior military assistant to Dick Cheney, Owens additionally served as the CEO for SAIC

435
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:26,000
All in all, the SAPOC, which was restructured in the early 1990s to serve as a gatekeeping structure for UFO legacy programs according to Wilson, saw two of six personnel as former SAIC alumni

436
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:35,000
This is why I wager the contractor Wilson accused as operating alongside the SAPOC SRG for UFO secrecy is in fact SAIC

437
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And let's not forget a critical third man mentioned in the Wilson Davis notes, Naval Reserve Commander Willard Miller

438
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Miller attended the 1997 meeting with VAD and Wilson and Stephen Greer, and yes, this meeting did take place, this is a fact

439
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,000
During this meeting in the EG&G parking lot between Davis and Wilson, Davis flashed a 2002 letter addressed to him from Commander Miller

440
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Within the letter, Miller offered to aid Davis and physicist Hal Putoff in their UFO crash retrieval research

441
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Miller requested anonymity, clearly this wasn't honored, but offered to connect the men to multiple high value targets and information including

442
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:23,000
A senior official with knowledge on alien reproduction vehicles, a list of civilian DOD contractors involved in UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation programs

443
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
In a team possibly involved with UFO crash retrievals

444
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Where did Miller get this intel? Was it first hand experience, exposure to programs or connections in the corporate world?

445
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Because Miller did after all work as a quote senior analyst in future counter threat planning, directed energy weapons, space systems and Navy space wargaming

446
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Indeed in a 2000 book called Swamp Gas Times, my two decades on the UFO beat by Patrick Hugh, emails between Commander Miller and Attorney Peter Gersten are detailed

447
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Miller believed quote

448
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
The relationship has both interest in and concern about the UFO phenomenon

449
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:28,000
If there are any keepers of the keys, they reside in DOD middle management and civilian DOD contractors, BDM, SAIC, Boeing, Lockheed

450
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And the com-trollers who monitor the flow of money to certain classified and special access programs

451
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Outside of the Wilson Davis notes, there are numerous possible high level SAIC personnel serving as gatekeepers for UFO programs

452
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Discussed already today and in my previous work, we have the US Admiral, Director of the NSA, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of Neuro, Vice Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency

453
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Who went from in 1989 discussing recovered UFOs becoming available for technological research with NASA mission specialist Bob Echler to saying he found plausible answers for all UFO sightings to project unity in 2022

454
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
We can also take an interesting look at US Navy Admiral William F. Rayborn

455
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Alongside John Deutch and Bobby Ray Inman, Rayborn was plucked for senior SAIC roles to stack the contractors payroll with scores of influential members of the National Security Establishment

456
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Prior to his retirement from the Navy in 1963 and also prior to his positions within SAIC and the Director of National Intelligence from 1965 to 1966, Rayborn led the project to develop the Polaris missile system

457
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:52,000
The Polaris program, a two-stage solid-fueled nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missile, should sound extremely familiar to some viewers of my Naval UFO Legacy Program's video

458
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:03,000
A small detail, but in this video I discussed how Dr. John P. Craven, Chief Scientist of the Special Projects Office for the US Navy, spearheaded the Deep System Submergence Project

459
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and resulting deep-submergence rescue vehicles that I implicated in undersea UFO crash retrieval operations

460
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Craven himself stated the aforementioned DSSP and submersibles DSRBs were used for a tremendous amount of clandestine classified missions

461
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Craven also stated in his book The Silent War, the Deep Submergence Systems Project, which served to drastically increase the depth at which the Navy could perform undersea engineering operations

462
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
was created specifically to accomplish retrieval operations under Operation Sand-Dollar

463
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:51,000
According to Craven's memoirs, Sand-Dollar was a clandestine highly compartmentalized project that was tasked to retrieve militarily sensitive hardware and other items of national security importance from the seafloor of the continental shelf in the deep marine environments

464
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Craven wrote that this program Sand-Dollar is classified to this day, quote,

465
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I was shown an inventory itemizing the items known to be on the seabed and a map of their distribution throughout the world, end quote

466
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Outlining the complicated obfuscation of Sand-Dollar within the special access program world, Dr. Craven would state Sand-Dollar was buried within the structure of yet another secret program, itself hidden within the Polaris program

467
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Intriguing how Sand-Dollar, what eye wager was a UFO crash retrieval program, was buried under a web of programs hidden within the Polaris program, a program itself founded by Admiral Rayborn who would later on become an SAIC board member

468
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Let's finally discuss a possible gatekeeper to waived deep six UFO programs with high level ties to CIA and SAIC, Donald M. Kerr

469
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Kerr joined SAIC in 1993 as a corporate executive and vice president and director

470
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Kerr's resume includes director of Los Alamos National Labs from 79 to 85, president and director of EG&G from 89 to 92, CIA deputy director for science and technology from 01 to 05, director of the NRO from 05 to 07, and principal deputy director of national intelligence from 07 to 09

471
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Recall if you will the 1985 advanced theoretical physics working group and the notes of attendee Oki Shannon, former manager of special projects at Los Alamos and character in the Wilson Davis notes

472
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Held at the BDM Secure Facility in McLean, Virginia, this conference classified via DOE controls was supervised by the infamous Colonel John B. Alexander and held at BDM just one year after one of the primary characters of this channel, U.S. Army Inscom General Albert Stubblebine joined BDM International

473
00:46:48,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Oki Shannon startling notes from this conference reveal several discussions of interest for this channel, including mention of a major engineering project that existed under Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, naval information on underwater UFO hotspots near Gulfo San Matias, Argentina and mention of an organization that collects, manages and destroys UFO information

474
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Scribbled within the notes are actions Oki wished to pursue to continue a quest for cracking UFO reverse engineering programs. Towards the end of this page is a note discussing approaching Donald Kerr for influence and money.

475
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:43,000
In almost every single project I do, I discuss the CIA's Office of Global Access established under the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology in 2003 to serve as a logistics coordinator harnessing the muscle of joint special operations command for foreign UFO crash retrievals.

476
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:58,000
This CIA DSNT was additionally, alongside the Navy, the co-founder of Neuro, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, the U.S.'s most secret intelligence agency and one I have connected to underwater UFO crash retrievals.

477
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:17,000
This Office of Global Access was actually established under the watch of Donald Kerr, former VP of SAIC in the 90s, who remember served as the deputy director of the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology from 01 to 05.

478
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
How does a program like that get funded?

479
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I will give you generalities. I can get very specific in a closed session, but misappropriation of funds and self-fund.

480
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Does that mean that there is money in the budget that is said to go to a program but it doesn't and it goes to something else?

481
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yes, I have specific knowledge of that.

482
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Do you think U.S. corporations are overcharging for certain tech they're selling to the U.S. government and that additional money is going to programs?

483
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Correct, through something called IRAD.

484
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:59,000
In 2004, Catherine Austin Fitts, former Assistant Secretary for Housing and Urban Development, released the now legendary paper titled Black Budget of the United States.

485
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Throughout the 21st century, Fitts has identified trillions of dollars spent on the U.S. black budget.

486
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Fitts has outlined 21 trillion dollars in unauthorized spending in the Departments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development from 1995 to 2015.

487
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Much of this money on UFO-related, quote-unquote, clandestine military R&D.

488
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Recently, Fitts made a couple of podcast appearances on Tucker Carlson's and Danny Jones' shows, making some incredible statements regarding one of my favorite topics, deep underground military bases or dumbs.

489
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Over the years, Fitts has also engaged in some intriguing discussion of UFO legacy programs on Dark Journalist's page, including UFO economies 1, 2, and 3.

490
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Here's the thing, I'm glad you brought this up because I know you've had Richard on, and again, Richard's going to be on the Salier Report next week.

491
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And that's Richard Dole and the author of UFOs in the National Security State.

492
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Well, that's the best book in terms of describing the mechanisms put in place after World War II to create a far-expanded infrastructure for what I call the black budget.

493
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So you literally see the federal credit engineered in a way that can generate trillions and trillions of dollars for an infrastructure of private corporations and investors to control the most powerful technology in the world.

494
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:56,000
To try and figure out what that technology is, you know, is to go down a rabbit hole full of very squiggling information about what is and is not true, but suffice it to say that a tremendous amount of that money has gone into very high technology weaponry and certainly an investment in space and space travel.

495
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Fitz is surprisingly well-versed in UFO legacy programs, commenting on covert space economies, breakaway civilizations, the SDI or Strategic Defense Initiative being used to counter extraterrestrial threats, and black budget operations surrounding UFOs.

496
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Fitz even once argued to Dark Journalist, up to $60 trillion may have been spent on secret space program and UFO technologies, suggesting TUO or Technologies of Unknown Origin may be worth up to $150 trillion.

497
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Perhaps one day I can sit down with Catherine Austin-Fitz and have a very poignant discussion on UFO legacy program financing, but I would like to circle back to black budget of the United States.

498
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:52,000
In the paper, Fitz writes, quote, large portions of the nation's wealth is being illegally diverted into secret unaccountable channels, end quote, to support clandestine domestic military research and development.

499
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:04,000
While stat, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Fitz came across evidence IT slash accounting systems providers were responsible for the obfuscation of funds and omitting data where DOD funds were directed.

500
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:14,000
These included Lockheed Martin information systems, which would later merge with Lados in 2015, IBM, DineCorp, and of course SAIC.

501
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:33,000
One of the things I used to have these fights with the defense contractors because I was required to get the accounts when we, I still needed data and the systems were run by the big defense contractors at HUD, and they would refuse to give me the data so I'd have these wars with them.

502
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's like, who really runs HUD? Is it the defense contractor or is it the point, you know, the person who's legally responsible?

503
00:52:40,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And speculating, I'd say they have a very perfect situation to do any type of research they want to under the guise of anything, I mean, and call it what they want.

504
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And they definitely aren't working alone in anything. So anybody doing business with them, they are what's called like a conglomerate.

505
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:33,000
There's SAIC, but it's made up of numerous individual corporations, and these corporations, some of them are very well known and some of them are smaller, but they have some very big genius minds there and a lot of very cutting-edge work being done there.

506
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And millions and millions of dollars coming in. And since it's privately owned corporations, I don't know, the only people they'd have to report to is the ones they're doing business with and they're contracting with.

507
00:53:49,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And so if the people they're contracting with wish to do something that maybe isn't in the best interest of everyone, nobody is going to know about it.

508
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It's all kept in-house, the funding, the financing, the contracts, there should be files, there should be documentation, and a regular timeline of events on every project which did not exist whatsoever.

509
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And if I'm working in a military division and I have access to all the files, where were these, where was this documentation?

510
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
So it made me very suspicious of where all this money was going.

511
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Let's now reference the 2001 testimony of former SAIC administrative employee Denise McKenzie.

512
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,000
McKenzie's testimony is somewhat legendary in the UFO legacy program Financial Analyst Community.

513
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:58,000
After all, McKenzie's experiences were detailed on text in Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document, and she was never heard from again.

514
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It's even more interesting, the big defense contractor that does all the UFO stuff, like for the military and the government, is in La Jolla.

515
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And out in front of their building, they have two eight foot tall Egyptian statues, and one is holding a pyramid in his hand, and this is the past, and one's holding a pyramid in his hand, and this is the future.

516
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And they're big bronze statues in front of this company.

517
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:33,000
In this company, I have on one of these tapes a girl testifying how they put billions of dollars or millions of dollars into UFO related programs, and they create them and they're fake.

518
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So when they get audited by the general accounting office of the United States government, it just looks like all the money's going into more helicopters, but it's really going into like UFO related programs.

519
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Today, I'm thrilled to announce I have found McKenzie's March 2001 videotaped interview nestled within the files of the DPI archive.

520
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I have also found and made outreach to Mrs. McKenzie herself.

521
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I do hope she connects with me in the future, but for now let's analyze her complete recorded testimony.

522
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
McKenzie was introduced to SAIC while working retail in 1992.

523
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:17,000
While working at a fabric store in a San Diego mall, a part-time co-worker of McKenzie named Sophia asked her to move to SAIC at La Jolla, San Diego, where Sophia primarily worked.

524
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Denise had never heard of the defense giant, but was intrigued to work a cushy office job on a massive campus.

525
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,000
When she first visited the La Jolla site, McKenzie expected to interview for an administrative assistant position.

526
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
But with no paperwork or meetings, McKenzie was immediately told she had the job.

527
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
She didn't even know the department in which she was supposed to work.

528
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:47,000
During her first few days in the office, McKenzie noticed her recruiter, Sophia, was not present at SAIC and wouldn't show up for another two to three weeks.

529
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
During her first three to four days of work, McKenzie had no real tasks.

530
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
She would wander her building of work to look busy, gauging the department's computer files and personnel.

531
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
McKenzie would realize she worked within SAIC's military contract division.

532
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Within SAIC La Jolla on Campus Drive, Denise would notice a highly classified biological division that featured extremely strict personnel access control.

533
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
And let's take a quick pause here.

534
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
SAIC has a history of intriguing chemical and biological contracts.

535
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Let's note this 2005 SAIC Research Development Test and Evaluation Group contract that tasked SAIC's McLean, Virginia and San Diego, California divisions

536
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:43,000
to perform biological, chemical, radiological, nuclear, and explosive, or CBRNE work with the Air Force Operational Test Center and Evaluation Center, or AFO-TEC, at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.

537
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Kirtland Air Force Base is not only home to a deep underground military installation, but also to Sandia National Labs, an FFRDC, which is a usual tricky customer of this channel for operational locations of UFO legacy programs.

538
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Recurring viewers of my channel will absolutely recognize Sandia, and by the way, SAIC has a history of absolutely enormous contracts with Sandia National Labs,

539
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:16,000
such as this 2013 $228 million contract for IT consolidation for, quote,

540
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:27,000
mission-specific information technology research development and integration of capabilities while maintaining high-performance and central-hosting computing desktop services and cybersecurity, end quote.

541
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:39,000
What is interesting about this specific relationship with SAIC and AFO-TEC for CBRNE work we just mentioned above is a quote from SAIC's Senior Vice President Chuck Zhang, quote,

542
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:57,000
under the CBRNE contract, SAIC will assess new and emerging technologies and concepts, will work to determine their technological maturity when operated under realistic environments to help give US warfighters the tools they need to do their jobs more safely and effectively, end quote.

543
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It is interesting how SAIC's biological work has been contracted from AFO-TEC, or the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center we just mentioned above.

544
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:19,000
AFO-TEC historically has supported the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Advanced Systems and Concepts, or DUSD-AS&C, for all non-traditional acquisition programs.

545
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:28,000
In the future, I'll be paying much closer attention to this DUSD-AS&C and the office's possible involvement in UFO legacy programs.

546
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:39,000
After all, according to the General Accounting Office in 2002, DUSD-AS&C was responsible for DOD Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration Programs.

547
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:50,000
The connections to our work here are indeed perplexing. SAIC has a history of being awarded sole-source contracts to support the Joint Technology Assessment Activity, or JTAA.

548
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:00,000
A large part of the JTAA portfolio supports the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Advanced Systems and Concepts, or the DUSD-AS&C.

549
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Many of these sole-source SAIC JTAA contracts are for work at, you guessed it, the Naval Service Warfare Center Crane, which allegedly houses the Off-World Technologies Division.

550
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Funny enough, former DUSD-AS&C appointees have a history of working for contractors suspected of being involved with UFO legacy program operations before and after service in the Office of the Undersecretary for Defense.

551
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:37,000
These include Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Sue C. Payton, who served as a manager of advanced technology and Lockheed Martin before her service in the DOD.

552
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:44,000
But after that brief sidestep into SAIC and their biological departments, let's get back to the story of Denise McKenzie.

553
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:52,000
McKenzie's work picked up when she received numerous letters from U.S. military and defense contractors requesting Project Report updates.

554
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:07,000
McKenzie's immediate superiors blew off the importance of these Project Report updates, instructing McKenzie to issue a generic response to DOD and contractors alike, saying something to the effect of, quote, we're working on it, end quote.

555
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Eager to perform efficiently in her new role, Denise McKenzie would retrieve files and computer disks pertaining to the letters she received.

556
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Each and every contract file, ranging from recent to several years old, contained only two to three form letters, all stating the same thing, quote, it's being worked on, end quote.

557
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Some of these forms were signed by SAIC senior personnel and some were left completely unsigned.

558
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:41,000
These were enormous contracts worth millions and millions of dollars with absolutely zero activity on the contracts.

559
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:51,000
McKenzie reported the missing contract activity to her recruiter, Sophia, who grew furious Denise took initiative to search through SAIC's file database.

560
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:03,000
During her interview, Denise pondered why Sophia, positioned under SAIC's head scientist, was working and recruiting new SAIC administrative personnel from a fabric store at a mall.

561
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:11,000
McKenzie was ordered to bring all files and disks pertaining to relevant contracts to her immediate superiors and to forget all about the matter.

562
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:18,000
In her following short time at SAIC, McKenzie was harassed by her head supervisor, a man named Stuart Stanley.

563
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I'm trying to track down this Stuart and while unable to find him yet, I haven't covered a man by that name residing in La Jolla San Diego at the time of Denise's employment at SAIC.

564
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:39,000
McKenzie's final straw occurred at the contractor when she choked on food and her immediate supervisor stood by and watched instead of attempting to help or to call an ambulance.

565
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:52,000
After leaving the company, McKenzie would search the early internet for her recruiter, Sophia, and would eventually find an image of Sophia on a CIA website with a different first name and same last name.

566
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:03,000
This webpage listed deceased agents and while her incident took place in 1992, quote unquote, Sophia had supposedly died in 1987 or 1988.

567
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Remember if you will, SAIC's relationship with the NSA, intimate ties with the US Big Five intelligence agencies appear rampant with SAIC.

568
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I thought they were getting a lot of money for doing nothing and I didn't know where that money was going.

569
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It's like a friend, a friend for something. I mean, if it wasn't such a big complex and evidently well known, which I found out, you know, as I worked there, I would have been very suspicious of what was going on.

570
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And if you wanted to just hide funds or push funds through and call it whatever you want, Joe's Market, I mean, it was like Joe's Market on a huge scale.

571
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:58,000
So what was I to do about it? I mean, there wasn't much I could say or do about it.

572
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Mackenzie was not the only SAIC employee in 1992 to make such allegations. According to the excellent 2007 Vanity Fair article titled Washington's Shadow, quote,

573
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,000
According to one former executive in a sworn deposition in 1992, the practice of quote unquote mischarging became institutionalized within the company, end quote.

574
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Analyzing Mackenzie's testimony, we can see SAIC ran enormous contracts with DoD and other contractors with absolutely zero activity on these contracts.

575
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:39,000
This implies these monies were funneled from legitimate projects into more secret black budget clandestine operations.

576
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And perhaps we have a real instance of this we can analyze.

577
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Banning into space, a layered defense to protect the country from nuclear devastation.

578
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:08,000
U.S. spy satellites would watch the world below, detect Soviet missiles blasting off, compute the position and speed of each missile,

579
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
alert battle stations in space on Earth.

580
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:21,000
The first response, space-based kinetic energy weapons fire high-speed projectiles from hypervelocity guns,

581
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
intercepting enemy missiles as they are boosted through the atmosphere.

582
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Popped up into space, Earth-based nuclear-powered X-ray lasers fire their radioactive rays.

583
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Attack rays from land-based eczema lasers are redirected by huge mirrors orbiting in space.

584
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Chemical lasers fire beams that burn through the shell of the onrushing missile.

585
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Particle beam weapons with pulsing rays join the attack.

586
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Still over the atmosphere.

587
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
In the same year of 1992, then-Secretary of Defense, the infamous Dick Cheney,

588
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,000
was called to investigate whistleblower claims of fraud and waste surrounding the Strategic Defense Initiative.

589
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Since 1986, scientist Aldrich Saussier claimed the SDI, or Star Wars program,

590
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
displayed a pattern of, quote, miss-management and abuse,

591
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
and wasteful spending on research and development,

592
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
end quote, miss-reporting and misleading Congress of its efficacy.

593
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Saussier was dismissed from the Star Wars program for, quote, poor performance

594
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
and was even investigated by the FBI.

595
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Democratic Congressman John Conyers determined actions against Saussier were whistleblower retaliatory activities.

596
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And by 1992, Cheney reviewed the case and Saussier was given whistleblower protection.

597
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
But why is any of this important here?

598
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I have talked in several projects of backdoor UFO programs being built into Ronald Reagan's 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative,

599
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
a missile defense system built to defend the United States from attacks by ballistic nuclear missiles.

600
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Let's break this down in a second, but since SDI's inception in 1983,

601
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
U.S. contractors including SAIC and their systems integrator abilities

602
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,000
were relied on more than ever by the Defense Department for successful implementation of SDI.

603
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,000
In 1985, SAIC had an employee, retired USAF two-star general Jasper Welch

604
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
that exclusively coordinated with Star Wars efforts.

605
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:33,000
In 1985, SAIC had won more strategic defense initiative-related contracts

606
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
than General Dynamics, Northrop, Raytheon, Grumman, and the Rand Corporation combined.

607
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Beginning in 1978 and throughout Star Wars, SAIC was, quote,

608
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,000
best represented contractor, end quote, for a key SDI technology, particle beam weapons.

609
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
So essentially, SAIC had been accused by Catherine Austin Fitz

610
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
as back-channeling money from legitimate contracts into clandestine operations.

611
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative was proven by the whistleblower claims of

612
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Aldrich Saussier to purposely mislead Congress on the efficacy of SDI,

613
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
end quote, wasteful spending on research and development, end quote.

614
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And SAIC was considered a critical contractor for their expertise and reliability for critical work on SDI.

615
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Now I just previously said there are numerous implications

616
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:30,000
SDI actually held a swath of UFO programs that saw secret monies backchannel from primarily SDI funding mechanisms.

617
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
With SAIC's work on SDI and history of illegally diverting funds from legitimate to black-budget contracts,

618
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I do not at all think it is a stretch to assume SAIC was one of the primary contractors

619
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
engaged with SDI and UFO legacy programs.

620
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Previously, I discussed the involvement of Northrop, the Grumman Corporation,

621
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:57,000
and Teledyne Ryan, a Northrop Grumman purchase in regards to SDI and UFO programs,

622
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
but today we have much more to discuss.

623
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,000
One whistleblower I have covered in depth on this channel is former USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet

624
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,000
in his claims of the reverse engineered alien reproduction vehicle called the TR-3B.

625
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:18,000
As I have stated before, although Fouchet was unable to provide material evidence for the existence of TR-3B,

626
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
his disclosures have served to deliver some extremely actionable intelligence.

627
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
During his 1998 disclosures, Fouchet would discuss the DARCE,

628
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,000
the Defense Advanced Research Center allegedly stationed underground near Area 51 Grum Lake

629
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
that worked on UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation projects.

630
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
The DARCE in question, the Defense Advanced Research Center,

631
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
not to be confused with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency,

632
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
was actually a proposed institution.

633
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:53,000
So let's reference this declassified Advanced Research Project Agency study written in 1973.

634
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:59,000
The study in question was written as a historical evaluation of the R&D Management Institution, ARPA,

635
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
who at this time had, quote,

636
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:07,000
remarkably little in the way of an official record or institutional memory had been established, end quote.

637
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:13,000
On page 82 of the document under ARPA Laboratories discussing advanced aerospace projects,

638
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
we find a DOD directive showing the Army Ballistic Missile Agency

639
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,000
was considered for transfer into the DARCE, the Defense Advanced Research Center,

640
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
linking the department to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

641
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
And it is worth noting the Army Ballistic Missile Agency

642
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
was commanded by Nazi V-2 rocket scientist

643
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
in Operation Paperclip Transfer, Werner von Braun.

644
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Von Braun's mentor was father of German rocketry, Hermann Oberth,

645
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
who performed extensive study on UFOs.

646
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:47,000
And I've previously covered how extensively Nazi scientists were involved in early UFO programs,

647
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
such as discussing Hans Kamler, director of numerous Nazi special weapons projects

648
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
who may have been tasked with studying the 1933 Magenta Italy crashed UFO,

649
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
who curiously went missing near the end of the war,

650
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
but was claimed to be working with Americans post-World War II,

651
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
as well as Xavier Dorsch, head of the TOT organization,

652
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:13,000
who was requested by Air Material Command for Operation Paperclip for underground plant construction.

653
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Fusche would state DARCE was bolstered in the mid-1980s

654
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
when the institution was flushed with money from the Strategic Defense Initiative.

655
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Fusche and his sources estimated up to 35% of SDI's funding

656
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
was siphoned off to support the UFO Black programs.

657
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Indeed, for its maiden operational flight in the mid-1990s,

658
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Fusche would state the TR-3B, whose program was administrated by the NRO, NSA, and CIA,

659
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,000
and worked primarily by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, and Teledyne Ryan,

660
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
the reverse engineered vehicle was built by Strategic Defense Initiative money.

661
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
In 2013, stealth aircraft researcher Joseph Jones

662
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
would claim the existence of Project Brilliant Buzzard,

663
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
a codename for an airborne surveillance and tracking program

664
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
that dealt with setting up an electromagnetic shield around the US,

665
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
utilizing an enormous boomerang-shaped craft.

666
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
This boomerang featured an almost indefinite loiter time,

667
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
and Brilliant Buzzard was allegedly primarily contracted to Boeing.

668
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,000
The Brilliant Buzzard craft was seemingly responsible for 25,000 eye-witness sightings

669
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
between 1983 and 1989 of the Hudson Valley boomerang,

670
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:31,000
and this enormous craft was, of course, allegedly a program born from the Strategic Defense Initiative.

671
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Viewers of my channel will know I adore referencing the work of legendary

672
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
UFO crash retrieval investigator Leonard Stringfield

673
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
to analyze relevant UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation cases.

674
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And as it turns out, we do have a rather intriguing Star Wars case

675
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
in crash retrieval status reports 1 through 7,

676
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
specifically 1991's UFO crash retrievals the Inner Sanctum Status Report 6.

677
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Stringfield's eclectic work analyzed a 1989 UFO crash retrieval case

678
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,000
alleged to have occurred over Maritius Bay, Long Island, New York, USA.

679
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Now, be mindful that there is an additional Long Island, New York UFO crash retrieval case

680
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
that allegedly occurred in 1992.

681
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
This 92 case is indeed perplexing and features numerous eye-witnesses

682
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
and the possible involvement of the Department of Energy's

683
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
FFRDC Brookhaven National Laboratory located in Upton, New York.

684
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Perhaps we will revisit this case in an extended session soon,

685
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
but let's circle back to 1989, the work of Stringfield

686
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
and reporting from LIUFON, the Long Island UFO Network.

687
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
This case details a crashed UFO in the area of Maritius Bay

688
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
off the south shore of Suffolk County, Long Island, New York

689
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
on the early morning of 29 September 1989.

690
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,000
And according to LIUFON and Stringfield, the craft crashing was not an accident,

691
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,000
but instead a carefully planned and executed military intelligence operation to down the craft.

692
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
According to an anonymous Air Force Intelligence Colonel,

693
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,000
the incident involved the downing of a UFO by the use of a US Star Wars weapon on that night.

694
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,000
The craft crashed into the Dune area where it was subsequently retrieved, end quote.

695
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Quite shockingly, this unnamed Colonel additionally stated

696
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
18 US servicemen were killed by biologics on board the craft

697
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
who retaliated with a device that quote,

698
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
generates extremely low frequency sound waves

699
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
which can destroy the molecular cohesiveness of known matter.

700
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Quite the extraordinary claim and a claim that I can find no record of

701
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
regarding the deaths of several US servicemen.

702
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
However, multiple eyewitnesses including a commodities broker

703
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
claimed to have seen helicopters transporting a large object

704
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
and military vehicles with a police escort headed towards Brookhaven National Labs.

705
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Another anonymous source, this time a Brookhaven scientist named Dr. Nick,

706
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
told LIUFON investigators a large wedge or boomerang shaped object

707
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
with shockingly low mass was recovered and transported to Brookhaven.

708
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Having previously worked under Wright Patterson AFB to study UFOs,

709
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Dr. Nick claimed the weapon utilized to down the craft was constructed by AIL electronics.

710
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Now remember how the anonymous Colonel claimed the craft was down

711
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
by a strategic defense initiative weapon

712
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
and according to Dr. Nick, Brookhaven National Labs deployed this weapon.

713
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Brookhaven is of course a Department of Energy sponsored FFRDC.

714
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Brookhaven additionally did work on the strategic defense initiative

715
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,000
such as aiding in SDI's lethality and target hardening projects.

716
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Reference for example this 1987 DTIC document titled

717
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Report to the Congress on Strategic Defense Initiative and quote

718
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Alongside White Sands missile range and Los Alamos National Labs,

719
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Brookhaven aided SDI through study and testing of SDI weapons

720
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
that quote required lethal energy to achieve a sure kill

721
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
against the full spectrum of enemy targets.

722
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
One contractor that worked alongside Brookhaven,

723
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
White Sands and Los Alamos for SDI's lethality and target hardening program

724
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
was of course SAIC.

725
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Interesting how SAIC and Brookhaven which was allegedly involved

726
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
with shooting down a UFO over Long Island, New York

727
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
both worked on SDI's and specifically the Defense Nuclear Agency's

728
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
lethality and target hardening programs that had a specific goal

729
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,000
of assessing the lethality of X-ray laser weapons against SDI threats.

730
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,000
All this boils down of course to the subject of directed energy weapons.

731
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Sources of mine have specifically informed me of SDI X-ray weapons

732
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
that were used to disable and down UFOs.

733
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
These connections between SAIC, black budget monies

734
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
and Reagan's strategic defense initiative are quite potent

735
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
and well worth exploring further in our future studies.

736
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,000
SAIC's misappropriation of funds doesn't just stop with the testimony of Mackenzie

737
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
or likely involvement with SDI UFO programs.

738
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,000
No, we have very real examples of SAIC wasting obscene amounts of money on contracts.

739
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:11,000
In 2002, a consortium run by SAIC including Boeing and Booz Allen Hamilton

740
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
was chosen by the National Security Agency to create Trailblazer.

741
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
A system intended to analyze mass collections of data on communication methods

742
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
such as cell phones, email, and internet.

743
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
This contract was worth at its inception over $280 million

744
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
and ballooned to billions within four years.

745
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
This program was even worked on by SAIC board member Bobby Ray Inman.

746
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Multiple NSA employees filed a complaint with the DoD Inspector General

747
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:45,000
regarding enormous amounts of fraud, waste, and abuse existing in SAIC's Trailblazer

748
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
when a successful operating prototype had already previously existed.

749
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
By 2005, the DoD Inspector General released a report on the investigation

750
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
where 90-plus percent of the findings were redacted.

751
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Some of the whistleblowers here including NSA employee William Binney

752
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
were harassed and raided by the FBI.

753
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Interesting how Binney has additionally commented on UFOs.

754
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Well, I think my problem is just like the UFO thing.

755
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Unless they start addressing these kinds of things,

756
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,000
that people's observations or basic measurements or facts

757
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
will kind of evidence that simply exist.

758
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Unless they start addressing them, there's always going to be questions

759
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
that people are going to question and never trust.

760
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I mean, especially now with the government, how much trust do you have in this government?

761
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Bizarrely, after the colossal failure that was Trailblazer,

762
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
SAIC was immediately awarded a contract for Execute Locust,

763
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,000
a revised Trailblazer program well worth $361 million.

764
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
SAIC's failed efforts on enormous contracts are not uncommon.

765
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Take VCF for example, Virtual Case File,

766
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
a $124 million contract with the FBI

767
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
to create an online central repository of data to serve the FBI.

768
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Only three years into Virtual Case File,

769
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
the project was written off by a global publication for technology professionals

770
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
as the, quote,

771
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
most highly publicized software failure in history, end quote.

772
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
According to the 2007 Vanity Fair article on SAIC,

773
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
we discussed earlier, quote,

774
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
If it turns out they can't deliver,

775
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
new contracts will simply be drawn up, end quote.

776
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Indeed, SAIC's convenient ineptitude to secure lucrative contracts for no work

777
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
and whopping failures doesn't just end here.

778
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
In 2005, SAIC's La Jolla San Diego location,

779
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
which was patrolled by DOD certified industrial security personnel,

780
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
was broken into.

781
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
This never solved burglary, according to SAIC,

782
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
saw the theft of one desktop computer and four laptops

783
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
out of 13 private offices containing personal data

784
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
on thousands of present and past employees.

785
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Presumably including the company's many former CIA operatives

786
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
and SA executives and Pentagon officials,

787
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
quite the targeted theft here.

788
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And I really cannot stress here how many incredibly suspicious and dubious actions

789
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
SAIC has conducted over the years that speaks to misappropriation

790
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
and funneling of funds used, in my opinion,

791
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
for black budget UFO programs.

792
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Further examples in this laundry list include SAIC defrauding

793
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
the U.S. government from 1987 to 1995

794
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
by creating fake, non-functioning prototypes for a USAF contract

795
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
to develop flat panel liquid crystal displays

796
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
to be used on various fighter jets.

797
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
As well as an early 2000s incident in which SAIC was charged with fraud

798
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
for submitting, quote, false and fraudulent statements

799
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
of its expected cost and profits,

800
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
and quote, for waste cleanup at various U.S. Air Force bases.

801
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
But before we move on here, I would like to touch on some of the relationships

802
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
SAIC has maintained with DOD defense contractors

803
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
that have been time and time again implicated

804
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
with black budget projects and UFO legacy programs.

805
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I'd like to draw your attention back to EG&G,

806
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
also known as Edgerton, Germanhausen and Greer Inc.

807
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
and I would wager most on this channel

808
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
have some familiarity with this intriguing contractor

809
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,000
that historically engaged closely with some of the U.S.'s most secret technologies.

810
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Started by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Harold Edgerton in 1931,

811
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
EG&G's activities are legendary in the UFO community

812
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:38,000
before the company was acquired by URS in 2002 and again by AECOM in 2014.

813
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Historically, EG&G shared responsibility at the Nevada test site

814
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
including Nellis Air Force Base in Area 51

815
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
for weapons development and high-tech testing

816
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
alongside Lawrence Livermore Labs, Raytheon and others.

817
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
EG&G's legendary status in the UFO community

818
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
arose from it being labeled as the contractor Bob Lazar claimed

819
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:05,000
hired him to reverse engineer UFO propulsion systems at Area 51 site 4.

820
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Quite recently, I also discussed how EG&G was one of multiple components connected

821
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
with UFO legacy programs that comprised the Department of Energy NEST

822
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
or Nuclear Emergency Response Team

823
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
and how I wagered the DOE NEST supported by EG&G

824
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
was the on-site technical and scientific team

825
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,000
that recovered a crashed UFO in the Peruvian jungle in 1997

826
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
witnessed by USMC Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan.

827
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
According to journalist George Knapp, Alfred O'Donnell,

828
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
a now deceased former senior manager at EG&G,

829
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,000
relayed to Knapp that quote-unquote they, meaning EG&G,

830
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
had in its possession a flying saucer recovered in New Mexico

831
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
as well as live non-human beings that looked vaguely human.

832
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Remember EG&G but just stick around here with me for a second

833
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
as I state to probably an annoying degree

834
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
a key component overlooked from joint USG contractor

835
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
UFO legacy program operations are the subject matter experts

836
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:09,000
and R&D ACES, FFRDCs are federally funded research and development centers.

837
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Over the course of my work, I have accused numerous such FFRDCs

838
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
as acting as key players in UFO material exploitation

839
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
and crash retrieval programs including Sandia National Labs,

840
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Los Alamos National Labs,

841
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
the Center for Naval Analysis, the MITRE Corporation,

842
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
the RAND Corporation and more.

843
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
The Administrator for Los Alamos National Labs, for example,

844
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
on behalf of the Department of Energy

845
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
is a little known corporation known as Triad National Security LLC.

846
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Triad National Security has a storied history of intriguing publications

847
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,000
but relevant to our discussion is how Triad is comprised of three entities,

848
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Texas A&M University, the University of California

849
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
and Battelle Memorial Institute.

850
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Alongside FFRDCs, I have spoken on their university

851
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
semi-private counterparts, UARCs,

852
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
or university affiliated research centers

853
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
and their involvement in UFO legacy programs.

854
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
The two universities comprising Triad are not UARCs,

855
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
but interesting nonetheless.

856
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
The contractor here of interest within Triad is Battelle

857
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
and Battelle is no stranger to this channel.

858
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
From its possible involvement studying Roswell Shape Memory Alloys

859
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
to its parallel project Blue Book called Project Stork

860
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
to research associating Battelle

861
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
to dugway-proving ground UFO legacy programs,

862
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Battelle is infamous on this channel.

863
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Battelle itself runs multiple FFRDCs including Oak Ridge,

864
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
a Sean Kirkpatrick safe haven post-arrow where he joined as CTO,

865
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Savannah River National Labs,

866
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
and the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center,

867
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:52,000
all of whom I suspect are involved in UFO legacy programs.

868
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
So isn't it interesting that Battelle formed a new LLC

869
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,000
under a trio of institutions to manage sites for the Department of Energy?

870
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Here we can finally circle back.

871
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,000
On 15 September 2004, SAIC entered into a similar venture.

872
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Analyzing a Form 10 SEC document,

873
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
we can see that in 2004 SAIC entered into an agreement

874
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
with EG&G Technical Services,

875
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
as well as Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, Inc.

876
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:25,000
to form RDS, Research and Development Solutions, LLC.

877
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
A now defunct group, RDS was quickly assigned

878
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
to the Department of Energy's National Energy Technical Laboratory

879
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,000
shortly after its founding with a total value of $217 million.

880
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Indeed, by 27 September 2004,

881
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
RDS was securing even more contracts with DOE,

882
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,000
with some contracts of up to $41 million.

883
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
The DOE's National Energy Technical Laboratory's mission

884
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
is to, quote, advance the national economic and energy security

885
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
of the United States, end quote.

886
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:02,000
In RDS's founding year, the NETL had a budget of over $900 million,

887
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
which was used for R&D programs in support of the DOE's offices

888
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
of fossil energy, energy efficiency and renewable energy and energy assurance,

889
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
as well as work with other federal agencies.

890
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
RDS was brought on to, quote,

891
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
support the management and integration of all stages of science

892
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
and technological development at NETL,

893
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
which could lead to commercially viable solutions in the energy area,

894
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
specific technical services areas to be performed

895
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
include R&D technology planning and analysis,

896
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
R&D operations, process engineering design and analysis,

897
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,000
computational research simulation and visualization,

898
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
environment safety and health assurance,

899
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
and partnership development, end quote.

900
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Of course, NETL has no direct connection we can see to UFO legacy programs,

901
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,000
but it is interesting that NETL does have connections to three companies

902
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,000
ranging from possibly to almost certainly involved in UFO legacy programs.

903
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Outside of RDS, SAIC engaged in multiple projects with EG&G,

904
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,000
as well as other contractors I suspect engage in UFO exploitation programs,

905
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
such as L3Harris and Alien Science and Technology,

906
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:18,000
as demonstrated in this 2005 250 million joint war fighting center support contract.

907
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
If Alien Science and Technology sits on the tip of your tongue,

908
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
that very well may be because this is a contractor mentioned alongside

909
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
the testimony of witness Ed.

910
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Ed served as a director for an electronics warfare group

911
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
out of the Edwards 412th Test Wing,

912
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
which is a major range and test facility base,

913
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
and claimed to work directly with scientists and test pilots

914
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
of reverse engineered UFO vehicles.

915
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,000
According to Ed, this program operated across the Nevada test and training range,

916
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
as well as the Edwards 412th Test Wing,

917
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Edwards Air Force Base, Nellis Air Force Base, Area 51, S4,

918
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
and underground connective tissue.

919
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
After his very real time at Edwards,

920
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Ed went on to work at the Pentagon

921
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
for USAF Research Development Test and Evaluation Panel chain,

922
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
where he claimed dozens of billions of dollars went missing each year

923
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
in non-TOA or non-transfer of authority funds.

924
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
During his time at the Pentagon,

925
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Ed also joined Alien Science and Technologies in Crystal City, Virginia

926
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
as an F-35 subject matter expert.

927
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I have also guest with the enormous bloated budget of the F-35 program

928
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
around $2 trillion,

929
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:31,000
this aircraft platform may hide funds for UFO program operations.

930
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
In a similar venture to RDS LLC by SAIC and EG&G,

931
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,000
and Triad National Security LLC under Battelle,

932
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
in 1999, the same year Northrop Grumman purchased Teledyne Ryan

933
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
and was engaged in a purchasing spree I have connected to UFO programs,

934
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
SAIC and Northrop entered a joint venture to create AMSEC LLC.

935
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
AMSEC grew from $100 million in revenue in 2000

936
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
to $500 million in revenue by 2007.

937
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Quote,

938
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
AMSEC contracts primarily with the Navy

939
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
are expected to gross $500 million next year.

940
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
AMSEC is jointly owned by Newport News Shipbuilding,

941
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
a division of Northrop Grumman,

942
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
and Science Applications International Corporation.

943
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
End quote.

944
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,000
AMSEC specializes in providing naval architecture and marine engineering,

945
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
naval ship systems assessments, maintenance engineering,

946
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
waterfront maintenance support, acquisition program support,

947
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
shipyard industrial engineering,

948
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
and C4I installation and support services.

949
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
AMSEC also provides lifecycle integrated logistics services,

950
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
including technical manual development,

951
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
provisioning documentation, spare parts management,

952
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
training development and delivery, and software development.

953
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
By the 2010s, AMSEC operated as a major contractor

954
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
providing engineering and technical services

955
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
in support of the Navy modernization program.

956
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Some AMSEC, IDIQ, or indefinite delivery and definite quantity contracts.

957
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
A contracting method, David Grush has stated support legacy program funding

958
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
saw 2015 contracts north of $83 million

959
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
for Naval Surface Warfare Centers for AMSEC.

960
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Consider me intrigued here, as I have previously discussed,

961
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
and as we will discuss later,

962
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
the testimony of Randy Anderson and SAIC

963
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
running the Off-World Technologies Division

964
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,000
below NSWC Crane in 2012 to 2015.

965
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
In my projects, when discussing DOD contractors,

966
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
FFRDCs, and new arcs,

967
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I try and single out official reports, internal reports,

968
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
defense technical intelligence center documents, etc.

969
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
to attempt to draw parallels to UFO legacy programs.

970
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Previous references have included project updates on Project Stork

971
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
and metallurgical alloy analysis by Battelle.

972
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
TRW's work on high-speed underground tunnels

973
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
possibly connecting deep underground military bases.

974
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
1972's Project Outgrowth

975
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
out of the US Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory

976
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
at Edwards Air Force Base detailing anti-gravity propulsion

977
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
and many, many, many more.

978
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Of course, seen as it's our subject today,

979
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
SAIC has their own compelling historical documentation.

980
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
In 1988, SAIC began work on a report titled

981
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Electric Propulsion Study for Edwards Air Force Base's

982
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Aeronautics Laboratory in the Air Force Base Technology Center,

983
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
AFSC.

984
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
As we've discussed throughout today, viewers of my channel

985
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
will recall my extremely high conviction regarding a joint

986
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
UFO-ARV Alien Reproduction Vehicle Program

987
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
existing between Edwards Air Force Base

988
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
and the Nevada Test and Training Range.

989
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Again, this was covered in great detail on my video on Ed,

990
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
an electronics warfare test director out of Edwards

991
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
who claimed to operate this program

992
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
engaging with UFO legacy program scientists

993
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
and ARV pilots.

994
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
This 1988 SAIC document, released August of 1990,

995
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,000
was written by SAIC investigator Dennis Cravens

996
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
and featured extensive contribution

997
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
from Assistant Director of Los Alamos National Labs

998
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Center for Explosive Technology Research,

999
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Ferris Williams.

1000
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
This paper discusses the byfield-brown effect.

1001
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Los Alamos National Labs and Lawrence Livermore National Labs

1002
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
work on highly classified power density devices

1003
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
for the Strategic Defense Initiative

1004
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
and ultimately suggests a five-dimensional approach

1005
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
to unifications of fields for novel propulsion methods.

1006
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
The report also suggests anti-gravity could be achieved

1007
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
by using rotating cylinders filled with mercury

1008
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
and should be considered for oceanic and atmospheric applications.

1009
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Intriguing to say the least, as this rotating mercury system

1010
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
is the exact propulsion method,

1011
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet claimed originated

1012
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
from reverse engineering out of Sandia

1013
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
in Lawrence Livermore National Labs

1014
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
that powered the TR-3B Alien Reproduction Vehicle.

1015
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
The circular plasma-filled accelerator ring

1016
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
called the Magnetic Field Disruptor

1017
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
surrounds a rotatable crew compartment.

1018
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined

1019
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
as far as technology.

1020
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed

1021
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
a reverse-engineered MFD

1022
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
and I believe the government will go at any lengths

1023
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
to protect this technology.

1024
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
But you're not going to be able to build one of these

1025
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
from what I tell you, nor am I.

1026
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
The government will go to any lengths.

1027
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Believe me, the plasma in this accelerator

1028
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
is mercury-based.

1029
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
It's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres

1030
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin,

1031
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
superconductivity,

1032
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute

1033
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
to create a superconductive plasma

1034
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
with a resulting gravity energy.

1035
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
The MFD generates a magnetic vortex field

1036
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
which disrupts and neutralizes the effects of gravity on mass

1037
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
within proximity by 89%.

1038
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Do not misunderstand, this is not anti-gravity.

1039
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force.

1040
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Just for consideration,

1041
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
it is also interesting how this Ferris-Williams,

1042
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
mentioned in this report,

1043
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
also spoke at a June 2001 UFO Technology Conference

1044
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
where it was mentioned his research was sponsored

1045
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
by Hal Putoff.

1046
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
This conference was actually held in La Jolla, San Diego

1047
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
with immediate proximity to numerous SAIC locations

1048
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
and their California headquarters.

1049
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
In July of 2018,

1050
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
journalist George Knapp released a leaked version of 38 DIRDS,

1051
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
or Defense Intelligence Reference Documents

1052
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
created under the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program,

1053
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
or ATIP.

1054
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
ATIP, of course, is the controversial office

1055
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Lou Elizondo claimed to direct, work for,

1056
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
or operate under in various capacities.

1057
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Much discussion has been conducted

1058
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
surrounding ATIP versus ASAP,

1059
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program.

1060
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
This is of course not the subject of today's video,

1061
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
and while I maintain ATIP was likely a white world cover

1062
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
for more classified programs under ASAP,

1063
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
we will not be discussing the complexities

1064
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
of ATIP versus ASAP today.

1065
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
On 16 January 2019,

1066
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
the Black Vault received a list of the aforementioned

1067
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
DIRD reports under FOIA.

1068
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
By March 2022,

1069
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
the Black Vault had successfully received copies

1070
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
of all 38 DIRD reports.

1071
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I have discussed these DIRDS before.

1072
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
The subject matter and topics of them

1073
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
are simply astounding.

1074
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
The DIRDS feature highly scientific

1075
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
and technical reports by various authors

1076
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
that touch on multiple core positions

1077
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
from spatial slash temporal translation

1078
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
to armament.

1079
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Some of these DIRDS include focus on

1080
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
space-time metric engineering by Hal Putoff,

1081
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
brain-machine interfaces by Dr. R. Genick,

1082
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
pulsed high-power microwave weaponry

1083
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
by Dr. James Wells,

1084
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
and advanced aerospace configurations

1085
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
by Dr. Paul Sizz.

1086
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
And it is interesting how in 2001,

1087
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Dr. Sizz appeared as a whistleblower

1088
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document.

1089
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
In his tape testimony to Greer,

1090
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Sizz discussed his eight years in the Air Force

1091
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

1092
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
and 30 years working for the McDonald-Douglas

1093
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
aircraft company.

1094
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Sizz discussed its involvement tracking UFOs

1095
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
while at Wright-Patterson,

1096
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
clocked at 20,000 miles per hour,

1097
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
performing unusual and silent maneuvers,

1098
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
as well as his time in classified projects

1099
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
at McDonald-Douglas.

1100
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Within these DIRDS are numerous papers

1101
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
written by the infamous Dr. Eric Davis,

1102
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
covering such topics as traversable wormholes,

1103
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
stargates, and negative energy,

1104
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
anti-gravity for aerospace applications,

1105
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
and concepts for extracting energy

1106
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
from the quantum vacuum.

1107
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
In a similar vein to these exotic DIRDS,

1108
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Davis had previously written a mind-boggling report

1109
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
from 2001 to 2003,

1110
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
titled Teleportation Physics Study.

1111
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
If you are somehow unfamiliar with Davis,

1112
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
please check out my project on the Wilson Davis Notes

1113
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
or my interview with Davis on Jesse Michael's channel.

1114
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Davis wrote teleportation physics study

1115
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
for the Air Force Research Laboratory,

1116
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
AFRL, for Air Force Material Command

1117
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
at Edwards Air Force Base.

1118
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Davis would go on to work at AFRL

1119
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
and would state during the Seoul 2024 Symposium,

1120
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
AFRL was where he uncovered irrefutable evidence

1121
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
of UFO legacy program operations.

1122
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Teleportation Physics Study devotes

1123
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
an entire report section to p-teleportation,

1124
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
a form of psychokinesis, quote,

1125
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
similar to telekinesis,

1126
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
but generally used to designate the movement of objects

1127
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
through other physical objects over great distances.

1128
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Telekinesis is a form of p-k,

1129
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
which describes the movement of stationary objects

1130
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
without the use of any known physical force,

1131
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
and p-k is essentially the direct influence

1132
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
of mind-on-matter without any known

1133
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
immediate physical energy or instrumentation, end quote.

1134
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
This p-k phenomenon, p-teleportation section,

1135
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
stated much of the theoretical

1136
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
slash experimental slash operational work on the subject

1137
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
was based off a little known program

1138
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
conducted at SRI International with the NSA.

1139
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Sponsored at times by the CIA, DIA,

1140
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
and US Army INSCOM

1141
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
that would later relocate to SAIC.

1142
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
This was the infamous remote viewing program,

1143
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
a.k.a. Project Stargate.

1144
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Well, there was, like, CIA docs about consciousness

1145
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
and, like, weird remote viewing stuff.

1146
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
I mean, besides the Stargate program

1147
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
that were released in the FOIA reading room

1148
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
on CIA's website, too, that are pretty trippy.

1149
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
We're like, wow, CIA's looking into

1150
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
some really interesting stuff.

1151
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I mean, they're a hardcore intel agency.

1152
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
What's going on there?

1153
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
But it makes sense that they would kind of

1154
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
have to find out if that's p-k.

1155
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Like, you can't ignore that

1156
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
if you're really doing your job.

1157
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
If your job is intelligence.

1158
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Like, okay, like, let's look at this.

1159
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
What's an aspect of the phenomenon,

1160
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
because it's like a reach out from

1161
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
the crash retrieval program, like, hey,

1162
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I need you to look into some weird stuff,

1163
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
because it might be the key unlock

1164
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
for something that we got in a warehouse, you know?

1165
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Yeah.

1166
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I speak often on the possibility

1167
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
some non-human vehicles are controlled

1168
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
not with complex control surfaces,

1169
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
but instead with thoughts or cognition.

1170
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
These sentiments have largely and recently

1171
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
been associated with Jake Barber

1172
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
and the discussion of psionics

1173
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
and programs focused on utilizing

1174
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
anomalous cognition to lure in UFO

1175
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,000
to shoot them down with EMP weaponry.

1176
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
And we came to a conclusion even in those days

1177
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
that the reason most flying saucers have failed

1178
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
is because our conclusion was that this being

1179
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
is part of the guidance system.

1180
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
He's part of that saucer.

1181
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
But as we just saw,

1182
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
discussion of UFOs and cognition far predate Barber.

1183
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
The late Colonel Philip J. Corso would claim

1184
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
he and the Army's Foreign Technology Division

1185
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
under Arthur Trudeau were in the early 1960s,

1186
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
tasked with numerous projects for the purpose

1187
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
of seeding and adapting technologies

1188
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
plucked from UFO crash retrievals,

1189
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,000
specifically Roswell, into the U.S. military

1190
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
industry, if possible.

1191
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
One such project, started in 1961,

1192
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
was focused on, quote,

1193
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
control guidance by brainwaves, end quote.

1194
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Corso had learned from official Roswell files

1195
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
the biologics on board the crash disk

1196
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
were part of the guidance system.

1197
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
The Foreign Technology Division sought to

1198
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
adapt this technology to allow humans

1199
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
to control ballistic missiles via brainwaves.

1200
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I've just had one of the most senior scientists

1201
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
in the U.S. Defense Department's former

1202
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
admitted to me that he was read into

1203
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
a UFO crash retrieval program.

1204
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I've spoken to well over 20 people now.

1205
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,000
What I was told consistently was

1206
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
the technology is mind-blowing,

1207
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
and they are not in a position

1208
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,000
to be able to engineer it yet,

1209
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
because it's just light years

1210
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
beyond what we have.

1211
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
It's a completely new type of physics,

1212
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
is what one person said to me.

1213
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
And you might be interested in this, Jay,

1214
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:02,000
because of the sort of direction

1215
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
that your interests have taken.

1216
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Without expanding on it,

1217
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
one of the people I spoke to told me

1218
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
that it had a lot to do with

1219
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
a mind-interface connection with the engineering

1220
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
that it was driven by some kind of consciousness

1221
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
or some kind of intelligent connection

1222
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,000
with machinery that was beyond our understanding.

1223
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Indeed, similar claims can be found

1224
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
within the files of the late legendary

1225
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Leonard Stringfield.

1226
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Analyzing Stringfield's notes

1227
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
reveals a conversation with one Mr. Hines,

1228
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
who had a source from Bell Labs.

1229
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Of course, Bell Labs I've discussed before,

1230
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
as having involvement in UFO legacy programs.

1231
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Lenn spoke to a Mr. Hines,

1232
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
who had a source from Bell Labs.

1233
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
The informants stated that he was on the flight line

1234
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,000
at a California Air Force Base in the early 1950s,

1235
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
and saw a UFO retrieval brought in.

1236
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
He allegedly saw a cutaway of the recovered craft,

1237
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
plus the headband transceiver worn by the aliens.

1238
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Anyone involved with the retrieval

1239
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
was subject to intense scrutiny and search.

1240
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Apparently, one man must have kept a part of the craft,

1241
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
and he mysteriously disappeared.

1242
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
He was never seen again.

1243
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
What I can tell you is that people who work on this technology

1244
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
tell me it has no control systems,

1245
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
no control surfaces,

1246
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,000
no visible propulsion system,

1247
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
no dials, no levers, no buttons.

1248
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
It's a shell.

1249
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
They tell me it's operated by consciousness.

1250
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Go figure.

1251
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,000
When analyzing USG's special access programs

1252
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
focused on anomalous mental phenomena,

1253
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
being moved into the secrecy of the corporate world,

1254
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I can't help but to think of direct parallels

1255
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
to UFO legacy programs.

1256
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Acknowledged US programs into anomalous cognition

1257
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,000
began in 1977 with Project Stargate.

1258
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Project Stargate was a joint secret army,

1259
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,000
DIA, CIA, and SRI International Contractor Program

1260
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
tasked to investigate the potential

1261
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
for military use of psychic phenomena.

1262
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
The program went by many codenames

1263
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
based on operational agencies within the program.

1264
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Gondola Wish, Stargate,

1265
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Sunstreak for the CIA,

1266
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Grille Flame for INSCOM,

1267
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Center Lane for the DIA, etc.

1268
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
This was until 1991

1269
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
when the project would consolidate under the Stargate project

1270
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
and be moved to our subject of today, SAIC.

1271
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Stargate was initially operated out of Fort Meade, Maryland

1272
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
with a key sponsor of the work

1273
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
being Major General Albert Stubblebine.

1274
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Stubblebine founded US Army Intelligence

1275
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
and Security Command INSCOM.

1276
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
INSCOM initially commanded the US Special Forces Unit,

1277
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
the ISA, Intelligence Support Activity.

1278
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
The ISA was later on moved to JSOC,

1279
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Joint Special Operations Command,

1280
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
where I and others like Chris Sharp

1281
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
have accused JSOC elements of participating

1282
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
in foreign UFO crash retrievals

1283
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
alongside the CIA Office of Global Access.

1284
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Stubblebine himself has been accused by numerous individuals

1285
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
such as Philip J. Corso and Stephen Greer

1286
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,000
of participating directly in UFO material exploitation programs

1287
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
at Fort Wachuka, funding clandestine men-in-black type entities

1288
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
and much more.

1289
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Stubblebine, according to Greer,

1290
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
is the man who offered Greer $2 billion

1291
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
to absorb Greer's organization, C-SETI,

1292
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
into the general's work.

1293
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
So it is quite intriguing,

1294
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
a general with keen aptitude for anomalous cognition

1295
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
would also be accused of participating

1296
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
in UFO legacy program operations.

1297
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
This reminds me of the quote we just heard from David Grush,

1298
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
but let's focus our work back to SAIC.

1299
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
SAIC would continue Stargate from 1991 to 1994.

1300
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:48,000
However, I would wager this work continued long after 1994.

1301
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
SAIC published 10 primary studies

1302
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
focused on remote viewing and sci phenomena.

1303
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
SAIC would coin the terms anomalous cognition,

1304
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
also known as remote viewing or clairvoyance,

1305
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
a quote, form of information transfer

1306
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,000
in which all known sensorial stimuli are absent.

1307
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,000
That is, some individuals are able to gain access to information

1308
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,000
by an as yet unknown process, end quote.

1309
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
As well as anomalous perturbation,

1310
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
aka psychokinesis, a quote,

1311
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
form of interaction with matter

1312
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
in which all known physical mechanisms are absent.

1313
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,000
That is, some individuals are able to influence matter

1314
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
by an as yet unknown process, end quote.

1315
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
In their official reports,

1316
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
SAIC stated they were and earlier programs

1317
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
were able to verify the existence of anomalous cognition

1318
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
but not able to verify the existence of anomalous perturbation.

1319
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,000
SAIC would employ agents and beacons for such experiments.

1320
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Agents displayed a quantitative measurement of displays

1321
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
of anomalous cognition and beacons served as individuals

1322
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
who would engage in direct sensorial stimuli

1323
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
from an intended target to act

1324
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
as a focus of attention for the anomalous cognition receiver.

1325
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Some pretty incredible stuff I know,

1326
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
and as I have stated before on numerous occasions,

1327
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I am still myself learning about PSY phenomena

1328
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
in relation to the subject of UFOs.

1329
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
So for now, we will leave SAIC's work into AC and AP,

1330
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
but perhaps we will revisit the subject in the future.

1331
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
But SAIC's possible hidden continuation of Stargate

1332
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
does tie into the last subject we will discuss today.

1333
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Naval Support Activity Crane,

1334
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
home to one of the nation's most important military laboratories,

1335
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
is sometimes referred to as the Pentagon's best kept secret,

1336
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Senator Joe Donnelly, Indiana.

1337
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
As I mentioned at the beginning of this video,

1338
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I have covered the case of Randy Anderson

1339
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
in the Off-World Technologies Division

1340
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
underneath NSWC Crane before.

1341
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
This early investigation was taken down

1342
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
to support Randy's testimony reaching a wider audience

1343
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
on Jesse Michael's platform.

1344
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
With this investigation into SAIC,

1345
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I thought it prudent to make my investigation

1346
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
into Randy Anderson available again.

1347
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
This is because the overwhelming majority of that investigation

1348
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,000
was labeling with high confidence SAIC

1349
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
as the contractor in question in charge

1350
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,000
of a secret division housing recovered technology.

1351
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,000
So for the full picture, I recommend watching my video

1352
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
to learn more about the data investigation,

1353
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
contractors, military units,

1354
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
and more associated with Randy's story

1355
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
and to hear more from Randy overall,

1356
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I highly recommend viewing Jesse's video.

1357
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
But let's briefly summarize Randy's experience

1358
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
and tie it into SAIC.

1359
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
In the early to mid-2010s,

1360
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Randy was sent to the Naval Surface Warfare Center

1361
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
in Crane, Indiana for advanced weapons training.

1362
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Anderson served as a US Army Green Beret,

1363
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
18 Bravo weapons sergeant,

1364
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
which meant the soldier was a highly trained expert

1365
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
in US and foreign small arms weaponry and explosives.

1366
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Anderson and his fellow Green Berets

1367
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
were sent to Crane for weapons testing and training courses.

1368
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
However, due to holding a TSSCI clearance,

1369
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Anderson and one other soldier

1370
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
were shown classified foreign and domestic weapon platforms.

1371
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
These included disruptive technologies

1372
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
such as unique Russian ballistics.

1373
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
But quickly, what is Crane?

1374
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, or NSWC,

1375
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
is part of the Naval Support Activity Crane

1376
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
alongside the US Army Ammunition Activity,

1377
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
which stockpiles much of the US mainland's munitions.

1378
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Crane, Indiana was chosen for these stockpile duties

1379
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
during World War II, as such a landlocked state

1380
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
would have proved to have been difficult

1381
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
to be targeted by enemy forces.

1382
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
NSWC Crane is a massive facility,

1383
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
with several underground layers highlighted

1384
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
as the Premier Navy Lab,

1385
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
whose mission is to quote,

1386
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
provide acquisition and in-service engineering

1387
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
and technical support for sensors, electronics,

1388
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,000
electronic warfare, and special warfare weapons,

1389
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
end quote.

1390
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Operations at Crane are divided into

1391
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
three distinct focus areas,

1392
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
strategic missions, electronic warfare,

1393
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
and expeditionary warfare.

1394
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
But this location doesn't focus on conventional missions.

1395
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
As we see from this recent Duke University

1396
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
long-range broad agency announcement,

1397
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
a key focus of Crane's programs

1398
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
is advanced concepts and technologies,

1399
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
end quote.

1400
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
And we discussed some of these advanced concepts

1401
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
and technologies earlier in this project

1402
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
with mention of SAIC and the JTAA.

1403
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
The underground presence of the base

1404
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
is key to mention here.

1405
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Not only are there numerous underground bunkers

1406
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
for munitions storage hidden below the ground,

1407
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
but also small arms testing resources,

1408
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
such as an underground 100 meter firing range.

1409
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Now as I mentioned earlier,

1410
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I'm here at Crane to test advanced foreign

1411
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
and domestic weaponry.

1412
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
The Crane facility has historically worked closely

1413
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
with the U.S. Army for weapons testing,

1414
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
training, and defensive capabilities,

1415
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
such as countering improvised explosive devices in Iraq.

1416
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
And the NSWC is no stranger to reverse engineering,

1417
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,000
critical technology to maintain quote unquote

1418
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
fleet readiness, such as an intriguing black box

1419
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I covered extensively in my first video on Randy Anderson.

1420
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Best of my knowledge, NSWC Crane is integral

1421
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
to naval UFO legacy programs.

1422
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Previously, not only did I tie intriguing NSWC Crane contracts

1423
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
to work done on UFO underwater recovery programs

1424
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
operating out of the Navy alongside Woods Hole

1425
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Oceanographic Institute and U.S. intelligence agencies,

1426
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,000
such as the NRO and the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office,

1427
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
but let's also mention that NSWC Crane

1428
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
likely resides in a complex system of naval centers

1429
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
engaged in T-U-O technologies of unknown origin,

1430
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
housing, and exploitation.

1431
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I know I say this all the time,

1432
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
but this really is another video for another day,

1433
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
as I am still deeply engaged with this research.

1434
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
The thesis I am building here, however, is this.

1435
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Naval undersea warfare center divisions,

1436
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
such as Keyport, and university affiliated research centers,

1437
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
such as the Applied Research Laboratory

1438
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
at the University of Hawaii at Manoa,

1439
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
engage with UFO data.

1440
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Naval surface warfare centers, such as Crane,

1441
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
engage with T-U-O hardware.

1442
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
And nav-air installations like China Lake and Patuxent River

1443
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
deal with quote-unquote aircraft.

1444
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
This really will be a worthy thread.

1445
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
We will pull on a bit now and more in the future

1446
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:19,000
that quite likely has SAIC written all over it.

1447
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
On 5 June 2025,

1448
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Immaculate Constellation whistleblower Matthew Brown

1449
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
illustrated an enormously impactful tweet

1450
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
that directly referenced UFO materials or craft

1451
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,000
being stored at the Patuxent River special project hangars

1452
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
that are owned by the Imentum Corporation

1453
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
amongst quote-unquote other fun spaces.

1454
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Of course, alongside Imentum,

1455
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
SAIC has a significant presence

1456
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River,

1457
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,000
enjoying similarly lucrative contracts to NSWC Crane

1458
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
while majorly supporting PAX River's

1459
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Naval Air Warfare Center aircraft division

1460
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
and ship and air integration warfare division.

1461
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Remember how earlier in this project

1462
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,000
we discussed joint ventures with SAIC and EGNG

1463
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
and SAIC in Northrop,

1464
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
possibly linked to UFO legacy programs?

1465
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Well, SAIC has engaged in similar practices with Imentum.

1466
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
A contractor Matt Brown has now accused

1467
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,000
of housing UFO materials at Nav Air PAX River.

1468
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
SAIC and Imentum join forces to form FSA,

1469
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
a contractor that as recently as 2020

1470
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
has secured IDIQ federal contracts

1471
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
in excess of $1.3 billion.

1472
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Perhaps in the future we can shed more light

1473
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
on possible joint SAIC Imentum work

1474
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
on UFO legacy programs at major Naval RD-TNE stations.

1475
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Anyways, after observing prosaic disruptive technologies,

1476
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Randy and one of his fellow soldiers

1477
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
were taken to a pristine and advanced location

1478
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
under Crane by an unmarked contractor in civilian clothes.

1479
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Anderson was told by this guide,

1480
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
a private contractor former military,

1481
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
in the same individual leading the weapons training course,

1482
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
quite nonchalantly,

1483
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
they were entering the quote-unquote

1484
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
off-world technologies division.

1485
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Upon entering, Randy did not enter

1486
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
a normal firing range or laboratory.

1487
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
He and the other men entered

1488
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
what seemed to be a scientific observation room

1489
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
overseeing a laboratory housing two pieces of technology

1490
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
staffed by one other contractor

1491
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
dressed similar to a lab technician.

1492
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
One device Randy witnessed was a sphere

1493
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
no bigger than a basketball

1494
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
that was seemingly constructed from seamless metal.

1495
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
The soldiers were told by their guide

1496
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
this object and the other piece of technology

1497
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
interacted with human consciousness.

1498
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
The other piece of technology

1499
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
was seemingly similar to a type of gauntlet

1500
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
that was according to the contractor

1501
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
considered weapon technology

1502
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
due to the tech producing an energetic discharge

1503
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
during recovery.

1504
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
This weapon was projecting some type of

1505
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
glyphic writing Randy could not distinguish

1506
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
between physical projection

1507
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
or projection into his mind.

1508
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Shortly after, Randy was escorted

1509
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
out of the off-world technologies division

1510
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
and to this day suffers extensive mental haze

1511
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
and memory problems surrounding this event.

1512
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
But where does SAIC tie into this?

1513
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
The mission of NSWC Crane

1514
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
is to provide the quote American warfighter

1515
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
with solutions to their toughest technical challenges

1516
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
to better equip a decisive advantage

1517
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
in electromagnetic warfare,

1518
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
strategic missions and expeditionary warfare end quote.

1519
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Crane employs a whopping

1520
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
2489 contracting force

1521
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
and engages in projects with numerous

1522
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
defense contractors, DOE labs

1523
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
like Sandia National Labs and universities.

1524
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
And also recall as I just mentioned

1525
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
earlier in this project we have already discussed

1526
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
mention of SAIC and many contracts

1527
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
for the JTAA,

1528
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
the Joint Technology Assessment Activity,

1529
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
a key component of Crane that supports

1530
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense

1531
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Advanced Systems and Concepts.

1532
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
SAIC, one of the DoD's

1533
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
premier science and technology

1534
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
subject matter experts

1535
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
and innovative contractors,

1536
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
aka Washington Shadow,

1537
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
who has better access to the Pentagon

1538
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
than the government's own attorneys,

1539
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
has extensive contracts of interest

1540
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
with NSWC Crane as well as a provable

1541
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
previous interest in consciousness

1542
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
related studies similar to the

1543
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
sphere Randy observed that

1544
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
reportedly only responded to human consciousness.

1545
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Indeed, right around

1546
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
the time of Randy's encounter, 2012,

1547
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
the Office of Naval Research

1548
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
was seemingly carrying on the legacy

1549
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
of SAIC and Stargate,

1550
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
announcing a revolutionary research study

1551
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
that investigated sixth sense

1552
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
among humans to understand how to train

1553
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
personnel on quote,

1554
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
intuitive decision making, end quote.

1555
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
But like we've been doing in this video,

1556
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
let's follow the money and analyze

1557
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
some contracts. In my project

1558
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
on joint U.S. Navy under C-UFO

1559
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
retrieval programs, I highlighted

1560
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
joint programs operating between

1561
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
the U.S. Navy, the Office of Naval Research,

1562
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
the Office of Naval Intelligence,

1563
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
U.S. Intelligence agencies such as

1564
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
NRO, NRO, NGA, CIA,

1565
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
as well as US SOCOM

1566
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
or Special Operations Command,

1567
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Defense Contractors, and FFRDC

1568
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
such as the Center for Naval Analysis,

1569
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
MITRE, SAIC,

1570
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute,

1571
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
and Premier U.S. Naval Weapons Facilities

1572
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
such as NSWC Crane

1573
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
and NSWC Chita Lake.

1574
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
In that project, which I highly recommend

1575
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
viewing, I discussed how Woods Hole

1576
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Oceanographic Institute provided

1577
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
submersibles for under C-UFO crash

1578
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
retrievals for their quote, unique

1579
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
capabilities that cannot be otherwise

1580
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
obtained, end quote. I theorized

1581
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
this work was conducted through

1582
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
SoulSource, IDIQ, and IDIC

1583
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
engineering service contracts

1584
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
between the National Defense Research and Development

1585
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Services and Woods Hole awarded

1586
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
to Naval Surface Warfare Centers.

1587
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Examples can be found

1588
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
between Woods Hole and Newit Keyport

1589
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
for the procurement of quote, hardware,

1590
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
materials, and supplies, as well as

1591
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
services to develop, build, fabricate,

1592
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
integrate, evaluate, and support

1593
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
the unmanned undersea vehicle family

1594
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
of systems for the Naval Undersea

1595
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Warfare Center, end quote.

1596
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Indeed, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute

1597
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
even has historical contracts

1598
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
with SAIC at NSWC Crane,

1599
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
such as this 24 May

1600
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
2023 contract for quote,

1601
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
research and development of expeditionary

1602
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
systems for Naval Sea Systems

1603
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Command, Naval Surface Warfare

1604
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Center Crane Weapon System Division

1605
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
JXN, end quote.

1606
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Crane's JXN,

1607
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
aka Weapon Systems Division,

1608
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
falls under NSWC Crane's JX

1609
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
or Special Warfare and

1610
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Expeditionary Systems Division.

1611
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
This is the department I previously suspected

1612
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
and still suspect holds

1613
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
the Off-World Technologies Division

1614
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
ran by SAIC.

1615
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Curiously, there is a 2020 contract

1616
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
of interest here that was deleted

1617
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
from SAIC's website.

1618
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
This $133 million contract

1619
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
awarded to SAIC

1620
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
tasked the corporation to continue to provide

1621
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
mission engineering and integration services

1622
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
to the Maneuver Engagement

1623
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
and Surveillance Systems Division

1624
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
at NSWC Crane.

1625
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
The Maneuver Surveillance and Engagement Division

1626
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
JXW falls parallel

1627
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
to the Weapon Systems Division JXN

1628
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
that sees joint contracts between

1629
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
SAIC, Woods Hole and Crane,

1630
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
both of which fall under the

1631
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
aforementioned Special Warfare

1632
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
and Expeditionary Systems Crane Division.

1633
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
In fact, analyzing this

1634
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
JXW Division brings even more

1635
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
intrigue. Nestled within

1636
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
the Maneuver Surveillance and Engagement

1637
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
branch that sees enormous contracts

1638
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
with SAIC is a subset called

1639
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
JXWT.

1640
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
The Special Capabilities Branch

1641
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
are elements of the Off-World

1642
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Technologies Division hidden within

1643
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Crane's Special Capabilities Branch.

1644
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,000
This 2020 $133 million contract

1645
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
may seem obscene, but SAIC

1646
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
is no stranger to frankly

1647
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
enormous contracts.

1648
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Earlier in this video, we discussed

1649
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
hundreds of millions of dollars awarded

1650
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
to SAIC for IT

1651
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
consolidation with Sandia National

1652
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Laboratories. But how about

1653
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
this 2023 contract that also

1654
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
suspiciously vanished from

1655
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
SAIC's website around January

1656
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
of 2024, detailing

1657
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
a $249 million

1658
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
in definite delivery

1659
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
in definite quantity, SAIC

1660
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
contract to support Crane's

1661
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Weapons Division Instrumentation Platform?

1662
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
These are but a handful

1663
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
of SAIC Crane contracts.

1664
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Numerous more absolutely

1665
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
enormous contracts exist, such as

1666
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
a 2010 $351 million contract

1667
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
for SAIC to provide

1668
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
technical engineering services

1669
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
to NSWC Crane in support

1670
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
of the Joint Special Operations

1671
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Response Department which is

1672
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
referencing JSOC.

1673
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
And remember, we've discussed today

1674
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
and as I do in almost every video

1675
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
I link JSOC elements

1676
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
to UFO crash retrieval.

1677
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Randy claimed the contractors

1678
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
associated with the classified

1679
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
prosaic weapons training took him to

1680
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
the Off-World Technologies Division.

1681
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
We can find even more examples

1682
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
of SAIC conducting weapons

1683
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
testing at Crane. In a now

1684
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
restricted article that was comically

1685
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
pulled after my video on Randy

1686
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Anderson, SAIC demonstrated

1687
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
extensive technical work providing

1688
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
expertise to improve C4 ISR

1689
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
a.k.a. command

1690
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
control, communications, computers,

1691
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance

1692
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
in weapon systems for the warfighter

1693
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
at NSWC Crane.

1694
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
So if Randy's story is true

1695
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
is SAIC the contractor running

1696
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
the Off-World Technologies Division?

1697
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Well there is no direct proof

1698
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
but I would wager there is ample

1699
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
evidence SAIC with their demonstrated

1700
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
interest in sigh phenomena

1701
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
engagement with assets I have accused

1702
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
of participating in UFO retrieval

1703
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
operations at Crane and proven

1704
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
history engaging in weapons training

1705
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
at Crane single out SAIC

1706
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
as operating an underground

1707
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
laboratory focused on the housing

1708
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
containment and possible exploitation

1709
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
of non human technology.

1710
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Anyways, as I said in the beginning of this video

1711
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I know for SAIC

1712
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
we don't have as many direct

1713
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
connections to UFO programs

1714
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
specifically craft housing

1715
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
and ARV production

1716
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
then we do companies like Northrop

1717
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
like we do Lockheed Morton

1718
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
or even some of Northrop subsidiaries

1719
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
TRW, BDM

1720
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
all the way back to Aerospace etc

1721
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
and then FFRDC's

1722
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
and so on and so forth.

1723
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
But I hope what I showed today

1724
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
is that diving through SAIC's

1725
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
corporate history

1726
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
some of their larger scandals

1727
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
some of their implications in UFO

1728
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
programs that this company

1729
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
has for lack of a better term

1730
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
quite a few skeletons in its

1731
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
closet. Whether this be

1732
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
defrauding the United States Government

1733
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
and intelligence agencies or federal

1734
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
forces like virtual case file

1735
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
with the FBI or

1736
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
the FBI

1737
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
or like project trailblazer

1738
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
with the NSA

1739
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
SAIC seems to

1740
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
have a repeating

1741
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
pattern of securing

1742
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
enormous contracts

1743
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
in either delivering no product

1744
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
underdelivering or underdelivering

1745
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
and asking for more money

1746
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
and as we saw from quotes throughout

1747
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
articles published by Forbes

1748
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
and published by Wall Street Journal in the early 2000s

1749
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
there are numerous numerous numerous

1750
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
occasions on which

1751
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
there are anonymous or named whistleblower

1752
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
complaints against SAIC

1753
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
and of course we saw this with Denise McKenzie

1754
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
as well. And I was really

1755
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
interested to kind of connect Aldrich Saussier

1756
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
and his claims of

1757
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
fraud with the SDI

1758
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
the Strategic Defense Initiative and parallel

1759
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
that to 1992 as well

1760
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
with Denise McKenzie and SAIC

1761
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
as we showed in this video

1762
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
SAIC was pretty much the

1763
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
largest contractor for SDI

1764
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
for quite a few years

1765
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
larger than other companies like Northrop Grumman

1766
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Lockheed Martin and so forth combined

1767
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
so by extension

1768
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I think it is safe to assume that some of this

1769
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
fraud and waste occurring in SDI

1770
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
would extend to its largest

1771
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
by an exponential factor

1772
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
contractor

1773
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
now with SAIC probably what everybody

1774
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
thought going into this video was of course

1775
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Randy Aitterson the Off-World Technologies Division

1776
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
and Project Stargate

1777
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
now I've said

1778
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
so many times and my opinion is really changing

1779
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
on this matter that some of the

1780
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
for lack of a better term

1781
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
psionics or psychic phenomena

1782
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
plural with the UFO programs

1783
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
whether that be cognitively

1784
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
interfacing with a craft

1785
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
in terms of course those claims

1786
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
and some of these beings flying

1787
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
UFOs via mind or via

1788
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
thoughts or headband transceivers

1789
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
some of Leonard Stringfield's notes

1790
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
I have really found

1791
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Solis in the quote by David Grush

1792
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
on JRE

1793
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
where David Grush talks about Stargate

1794
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
and remote viewing documents in the CIA

1795
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
reading room and other various

1796
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
remote viewing programs or AC

1797
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
or AP some of those

1798
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
terms coined by SAIC

1799
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
and I really found Solis

1800
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
and Grush saying to Joe

1801
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
when Joe kind of retorts back well of course

1802
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
the CIA would be looking to gain every single

1803
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
leverage into intelligence

1804
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
gathering whether that be a legitimate source

1805
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
or not that David Grush says

1806
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
well maybe some of these

1807
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
programs spawned out of a need

1808
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
to try and unlock something we have

1809
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
in a warehouse somewhere

1810
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I think that is an extremely interesting quote

1811
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
and that directly kind of

1812
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
corresponds to the story of Randy Anderson

1813
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
in the Off World Technologies division

1814
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
where some of this this sphere

1815
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
that he saw was claimed to

1816
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
interact with human consciousness

1817
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
and how the contractors

1818
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
at NSWC Crane

1819
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
which is most likely and I still

1820
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
maintain and I still maintain even stronger

1821
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
SAIC

1822
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
and I also think it's interesting

1823
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
the larger SAIC connection to some of the

1824
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
larger naval air stations

1825
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
or naval surface warfare centers across the nation

1826
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
I'm intrigued to really

1827
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
dive in more about Matt Brown

1828
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
statements about Patuxent

1829
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
River and the Amentum hangers

1830
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
and explore more of SAIC

1831
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
at Patuxent River maybe NSWC

1832
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Dolgren, China Lake, etc

1833
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
as well as their work with Amentum

1834
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
now looking into the corporate

1835
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
of SAIC I know it's

1836
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
quite convoluted especially when we got

1837
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
into the decision science applications

1838
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
and then that long

1839
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
road of DSAI going into

1840
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
DSA to Stephen Myers

1841
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
to L3 communications to

1842
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Engility to being bought up by SAIC

1843
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
and L3 airs I know

1844
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
that's crazy complicated I was

1845
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
really interested to find sort of

1846
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
similar to Triad National Security

1847
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
with Battelle and two universities

1848
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
that SAIC engaged in

1849
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
similar practices and this was

1850
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
with their RDS with

1851
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
EG&G now of course

1852
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
the LLC went defunct within a couple

1853
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
years but similar to Triad

1854
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
this was a crack

1855
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
to break into DOE

1856
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
lab work and Department of Energy

1857
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
classified work but

1858
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
I think one of the most tangible things we have

1859
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
from today's video some of the most tangible

1860
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
research is of course the SAIC

1861
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
whistleblowers I

1862
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
do not need to say more about

1863
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick

1864
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
I'm sure by the time this video comes out

1865
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
there will be a lot of stink about the Wall Street Journal article

1866
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
and

1867
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
maybe even we'll get that part too soon

1868
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
so I'd like to see more of

1869
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
more of basically a hero worship

1870
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
tale to Sean Kirkpatrick and his great work

1871
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
but I'd also like to ask

1872
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
if Kona Blue was just a project

1873
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
tricking all Air Force personnel

1874
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
what about the circular reporting

1875
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
those two seem at odds with each other from

1876
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Kirkpatrick's claims but anyway I digress

1877
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
I do believe we stumbled upon some other

1878
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
high-level SAIC gatekeepers

1879
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
and possibly

1880
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
individuals that need to be subpoenaed by Congress

1881
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
of course most of these individuals are

1882
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
ceased but some are still living

1883
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
these gatekeeper individuals include

1884
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
John M. Deutch, William J. Perry

1885
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Admiral Ray Bourne

1886
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Admiral Owens

1887
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
and Donald Kerr

1888
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I'd say of all of these individuals

1889
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Donald Kerr's CV

1890
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
has the greatest

1891
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
greatest CV and greatest

1892
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
work history that would lend to UFO legacy

1893
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
programs this being CIA, DS&T

1894
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
SAIC

1895
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
NRO, the MITRE Corporation

1896
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
etc. I'd be real interested

1897
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
to hear from more about

1898
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Don Kerr's work in legacy program operations

1899
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
and gosh

1900
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
I'd be really interested to speak to Oki Shannon

1901
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
as well of course we saw in the ATP

1902
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
notes from 85 we see look to Don

1903
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Kerr for influence and money

1904
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
and earlier in

1905
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
those notes I didn't include this in the video

1906
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
there's Don K slash

1907
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
dash ET with a couple other names

1908
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
now is this Don

1909
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Kerr most likely and why

1910
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
ET was there other information

1911
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
spoken about Don Kerr at this

1912
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
advanced theoretical physics working group

1913
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
at BDM's facility in McLean, Virginia

1914
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
that was held one year

1915
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
after Stubblebine joined BDM

1916
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I would certainly like to know more

1917
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
and also I know I said

1918
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
earlier in the video that I have found Denise

1919
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
McKenzie in attempted to main contact

1920
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I've heard nothing yet

1921
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I'd really like to speak to her to learn more

1922
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I've also found Mr. Stuart Stanley

1923
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
and I've tried to reach out to him

1924
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
nothing yet either so

1925
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
kind of the running theme with this video

1926
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
and as we said in the beginning SAIC

1927
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
has really seemed to stay in the shadows

1928
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
why that is

1929
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
I think they've really maintained a lower profile

1930
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
than companies like Northrop Grumman

1931
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
and Lockheed Martin and maintained a lower profile

1932
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
than even some of the other low profile guys

1933
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
like DNA, like Rand

1934
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
etc

1935
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
so I hope if anything this video just brings to light

1936
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
some of the involvement of SAIC

1937
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
and not only just do a full legacy programs

1938
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
but also black budget operations

1939
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
and some secretive work

1940
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I mean SAIC

1941
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
from its inception

1942
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
being staffed with high level individuals

1943
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
such as Bobby Ray Inman has had

1944
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
numerous

1945
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
numerous high level intelligence and military individuals

1946
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
the way this has been explained to me in the past

1947
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
as some individuals who work in UFO

1948
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
legacy programs within the DOD

1949
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
or IC

1950
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
they'll trade in their stripes and stars for a pinstripe suit

1951
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
and essentially

1952
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
these guys will go from working on UFO

1953
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
legacy programs within official

1954
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
United States government and DOD avenues

1955
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
and intelligence avenues

1956
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
to doing the same thing on a corporate payroll

1957
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
and you'd imagine

1958
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
with a lot of these gatekeepers we talked about

1959
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Sean Kirkpatrick included

1960
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
a lot of these guys would either go on to work at SAIC

1961
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
after

1962
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
service in the U.S. DOD or IC

1963
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
or before

1964
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
worked in SAIC

1965
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
this reminds me of John Doichu

1966
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
before he joined the

1967
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
joined us DepsecDef

1968
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
and spearheaded SAPOC SRG

1969
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
and SAPOC itself

1970
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
he was already on the board of SAIC

1971
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
and already working with TRW

1972
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
and how about that I know in the Northrop video

1973
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
we talked quite a bit about TRW

1974
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
TRW was of course purchased by Lockheed Martin

1975
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
in the early 2000s and

1976
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
another connection to the Wilson Davis notes

1977
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
TRW had also been

1978
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
kind of

1979
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
convicted and pursued legally for

1980
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
overcharging on space

1981
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
systems on space projects by the

1982
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
U.S. DOD in the early 90s

1983
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
and in that Northrop project I kind of

1984
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
tied that together

1985
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
with some of the near out auditing

1986
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
that almost found out some of the

1987
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
DOD UAP legacy programs

1988
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
so that's interesting as well that so many of these individuals

1989
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
also have connections to TRW

1990
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
of course with TRW

1991
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
have the old Zodiac story and so forth

1992
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
by pseudonym Sedgemasters

1993
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Richard Dolan's done some incredible

1994
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
work on that I'd love to work with him someday

1995
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
to revisit Zodiac

1996
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
but I'll leave my rant there

1997
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I do hope again that this is a springboard

1998
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
for more research into

1999
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
SAIC UFO legacy programs

2000
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I would like to hear more stories

2001
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
of

2002
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
ARV and SAIC tied together

2003
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
and I would like to hear more material

2004
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
exploitation programs and craft housing

2005
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
because

2006
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I'm going to say this in the end of my videos every time

2007
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
if you are

2008
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
an individual who has had

2009
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
experience first hand

2010
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
or have second hand knowledge on UFO legacy programs

2011
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
this be crash retrieval or material exploitation

2012
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
please

2013
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
email me at UAPGIRB

2014
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
at protonmail.com

2015
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I've switched away from a Gmail account

2016
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
I've had some wise advice that this wouldn't

2017
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
necessarily be a secure method to receive such

2018
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
communication so UAPGIRB

2024

every single video I do have a Patreon

2025
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I don't gate keep content there's nothing

2026
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
special on there that you won't get for free

2027
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
here but

2028
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
I say that to support the channel

2029
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000

2030
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
but again no content gate kept there

2031
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
a lot of exciting projects coming up

2032
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
maybe one interview I'm going to do that

2033
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
I would really really like to do

2034
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
but this just the first project

2035
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
in a long list of many

2036
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
new projects with the revitalized setup

2037
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
with continued

2038
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
attempts to get better at

2039
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
