WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.680
Okay. Hello, my friends. Can everybody hear us? We're live. If everybody can hear me,

00:11.680 --> 00:19.720
Towney, 3057, I appreciate that so much, man. If everybody can hear us, just say something

00:19.720 --> 00:31.520
in the chat. Let me know. Uh-oh. I think we're good. Yes, we can hear. Okay. All right, cool.

00:31.520 --> 00:36.640
Let me say it again. Towney, thank you, brother. I appreciate that a lot. Welcome, guys. This

00:36.640 --> 00:42.400
is the first live stream I have ever done. I'm here with Joey. This is his first ever

00:42.400 --> 00:46.840
public appearance, and there's 30 people here already. So, coming through loud here,

00:46.880 --> 00:53.440
you're being here. Yeah, thanks for having me. This was like really crazy. So, I've been

00:53.440 --> 01:01.400
here for a few days now, and Bruce Buffer to introduce you. Real quick, yesterday I made

01:01.400 --> 01:07.880
Joey watch a fight night, and he was craving Bruce Buffer's sweet voice and his awesome suit,

01:07.880 --> 01:15.400
but keep going. Curb is a huge UFC fan. If you guys don't know this, it was quite wild to be on

01:15.400 --> 01:23.240
the couch with him watching it. But yeah, so, you know, after, what's up, Bertie? A year of,

01:24.520 --> 01:30.120
hey, Xavier, I see you there. After a year of investigating Michael Herrera's case,

01:31.880 --> 01:36.600
so, I'm Joey is not your name on Reddit. You know, I've been investigating his case for

01:37.320 --> 01:44.520
about a year now. Finally, for the first time, took the trip to Denver to meet up with him

01:44.520 --> 01:51.240
for the first time, and luckily, Curb here is in the area and was gracious enough to host me.

01:52.440 --> 02:00.280
Yeah, so, we've just had a packed few days, and with this live stream, what we want to do is just

02:00.280 --> 02:05.320
kind of like recap, you know, how the last few days went, some of the things we did, and of course,

02:05.320 --> 02:09.800
you know, talk about our experience with Michael. Yeah, and any questions you guys have?

02:10.760 --> 02:15.560
List them in the chat. We'll try and get to everything. So, the story kind of went. We have

02:15.560 --> 02:22.360
been planning this trip for a couple months. Now, of course, I've said this in some comments. I don't

02:22.360 --> 02:26.440
know how many people have seen this, but I've been pretty public about this. I actually got to meet

02:26.440 --> 02:32.120
Michael a couple months ago. And so, I actually took him out to dinner. He's in Colorado. Y'all

02:32.120 --> 02:37.320
know I'm in Colorado. So, we actually got some food. So, this wasn't my first time meeting Michael,

02:37.320 --> 02:42.920
but it was Joey's. And real quick, Boxie Brown. Yes, if you see the poster in the background,

02:42.920 --> 02:47.640
I stepped that made this for me, and I love it. And Joey, on my main table, we go grab, oh,

02:48.360 --> 02:54.680
if you don't mind, you got UFOs. Sub last night from Michigan, Aiklin, AFB and debunking Bob was

02:54.680 --> 03:02.040
our strange times. Don't forget that you can click on that. We'll get to that. Joey made me this,

03:02.040 --> 03:06.680
guys. Isn't this sweet? And you know what? He didn't ask for the logo or anything to not let

03:06.680 --> 03:11.720
me know anything was up. So, he made this from his own hand, which is insane. As far as getting banned

03:11.720 --> 03:17.640
for UFOs, let's, Joey, can you unban this man? What is this? What is he saying? He says he got

03:17.640 --> 03:23.400
banned from UFOs for mentioning the Aiklin, AFB and debunking Bob Lazar. Oh, I see. I don't know

03:23.400 --> 03:29.080
anything about that. So, yeah, I'll have to look into that. Bernie wants to know what Joey thinks

03:29.080 --> 03:35.800
about Nathan. We will absolutely get to that when we talk, when we kind of mention it. We'll start

03:35.800 --> 03:41.720
so kind of the weekend on Friday, Joey was here and we met up with Michael for dinner.

03:42.360 --> 03:47.000
That's when we were originally planning to do the first live. And right after that, we've,

03:48.040 --> 03:52.120
sorry, just looking at some comments. Sorry, guys, this is my first live. So, if anything's a bit

03:52.120 --> 03:57.160
sloppy, that's probably why. But Friday night, we met up with Michael for dinner. He is a business

03:57.160 --> 04:03.480
owner. So, we went to one of his videos to film an interview. And right now, we have all the footage.

04:03.800 --> 04:09.080
We use three cameras. Joey has some incredible gear. So, it's very professionally recorded.

04:10.280 --> 04:14.680
I think we got about like four hours of footage. I think it was less than that. I think

04:15.400 --> 04:25.080
scallions, maybe two and a half to three hours, I think, of footage. But yeah, we set it up in one of

04:25.080 --> 04:31.560
his conference rooms and set up a few different angles. We have like a tight shot on Michael.

04:31.560 --> 04:36.040
Kind of felt that was important to kind of get his reaction to, you know, questions that, you know,

04:36.040 --> 04:40.760
as they were being asked to him and kind of close up. But one thing that was really cool,

04:40.760 --> 04:50.920
do you have the paper? The drawing? Yeah. So, at one point, you know, when he got to the craft,

04:50.920 --> 04:56.840
we were like, hey, can you just like draw this? And so, we've got this really cool kind of sequence

04:56.840 --> 05:04.760
of him going through, you know, kind of his memory as he's drawing this. And so, I thought that was

05:04.760 --> 05:09.240
kind of neat, you know. I want to give a quick thank you to scallions. I really appreciate that,

05:09.240 --> 05:16.040
brother. And Bernie and Rob here, if you, like, not agreeing with Michael, that's something that's

05:16.040 --> 05:20.200
totally all right. This case, you know, Joey and I have discussed this at length and discussed this

05:20.200 --> 05:25.160
with Michael. It's a, and somebody in another Discord asked a really pertinent question, like,

05:25.160 --> 05:30.520
what is, why is it so hard for a lot of people, like including myself from the get go, you know,

05:30.520 --> 05:35.400
but my first video I made on Michael, I was super skeptical about it. You know, why is his story

05:35.400 --> 05:40.440
so hard to believe? And I totally understand a lot of the skepticism around Michael's story. It's a,

05:41.320 --> 05:48.280
it's a really weird story, especially kind of factoring in like the huge UAP and Black,

05:48.280 --> 05:54.040
about Black program operators, as well as kind of being contacted by the insider and so forth. So,

05:54.760 --> 05:59.400
one of the things that I wanted to do with this interview, and Joey and I had talked about this

05:59.400 --> 06:05.320
a lot, is I found in other appearances from Michael in interviews and also Nathan's appearance,

06:05.320 --> 06:12.760
there was still a lot of confusion around Michael's Indonesia case. If I remember correctly, from

06:12.760 --> 06:16.600
Nathan's appearance, there was a lot of confusion for people who don't know these things.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.360
It was Michael's team leader at one point, and he was on the same deployment to Indonesia,

06:24.360 --> 06:30.280
and he recently was interviewed by Patrick on VETA, and he doesn't believe Michael. He thinks

06:30.280 --> 06:37.320
Michael's lying, and he provided, you know, his testimony, as well as a photograph that he

06:38.040 --> 06:43.960
claims shows Michael, you know, kind of prepping to go into Indonesia with him.

06:44.760 --> 06:50.120
And so, that was something we brought up to Michael as well. There's like a camouflage

06:50.120 --> 06:56.200
match that, you know, was brought up. And the fact of the matter is, I saw some discussion

06:56.200 --> 07:01.640
about this. Nathan was Michael's mission operation, like in the field team leader,

07:01.640 --> 07:07.080
that, you know, a question. I see some people saying like, you know, is he a plankman?

07:07.080 --> 07:11.400
I think Nathan's just a team leader that doesn't like Michael at all. Well, no one really,

07:11.480 --> 07:15.560
honestly, like no one liked Michael in the platoon. The thing that was so crazy for me,

07:16.680 --> 07:20.680
like meeting Michael for the first time in person, I mean, obviously, like over the past year, I've

07:20.680 --> 07:33.480
gotten to know him. It was just like a profile picture. Like, I've gotten to know Michael over

07:33.480 --> 07:40.440
the past year, but like meeting him in person, it just struck me that he is not at all the person

07:41.080 --> 07:47.960
that Nathan describes from 2009. I've also had the opportunity to speak with a few other

07:49.240 --> 07:55.640
people from Michael's platoon who knew him back then. And he's just a totally different person

07:55.640 --> 08:01.800
now. You know, he's like a completely remade person. And there's some, you know, he had some

08:01.800 --> 08:07.000
personal struggles after he got out of Marines that you can listen to his total disclosure

08:07.560 --> 08:11.480
interview. And he kind of goes into that. And it just, it just really makes a lot of sense.

08:11.480 --> 08:16.520
So he kind of hit rock bottom and just had this, you know, someone off in his head to like totally

08:16.520 --> 08:24.280
change his, his life. And I just, I just had like a totally positive experience. Like, as far as his

08:24.280 --> 08:33.480
character and his mannerisms and, you know, just like going out to eat and being polite, so polite

08:33.560 --> 08:38.600
to the, to the staff and just attentive, you know, in conversation and stuff like that.

08:39.800 --> 08:43.560
So that was kind of one of my big takeaways from, from meeting him in person.

08:43.560 --> 08:51.800
And so with the, with the, the Nathan's testimony, I found a lot of factual inaccuracies just from

08:51.800 --> 08:57.640
the time that interview was released with Nathan. A both vetted and Nathan were kind of pressing

08:57.640 --> 09:02.200
that this mission happened that night. It was like some secret night mission that didn't,

09:02.200 --> 09:06.200
that wasn't anything Michael had ever said. He'd always said this was a daytime mission.

09:06.760 --> 09:11.160
They said it, similar to the Arrow historical report this had to do with extraterrestrials

09:11.160 --> 09:18.760
and aliens. It did not. I had a couple other issues. But just like, I agree with some of the

09:18.760 --> 09:24.040
cases, there's some of the claims that Nathan was a little dismissed. Clearly does not like Michael

09:24.040 --> 09:28.040
kind of talking about how Michael would spend hours in the gym and just was a weirdo would

09:28.040 --> 09:31.880
take walks by himself. So for this interview, we really wanted to nail down

09:33.800 --> 09:38.040
a lot. Jim, Jim, thank you so much. I will get to your question in one second.

09:38.040 --> 09:44.840
We really wanted to nail down kind of a lot of the details of kind of Michael's story,

09:44.840 --> 09:49.000
including because one of Nathan's strongest claims is that he was on mission with Michael.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.160
And there's no way Michael could have gone on this UFO mission. So you'll see this in our

09:55.160 --> 10:00.040
interview, but Michael has stated before he was stationed on the USS Denver in Chow, preparing

10:00.040 --> 10:04.920
officer meals and so forth. And we really tried to nail down the time period that this volunteer

10:04.920 --> 10:08.680
mission where he ended up observing the UFO, he says he observed the UFO happened during one of

10:08.680 --> 10:13.160
his shifts in kind of the Chow Hall. This approach recruited us just to volunteer for this mission.

10:13.160 --> 10:18.280
This wasn't with his normal kind of team leader and fire team. This was a put together rag tag

10:18.280 --> 10:23.240
kind of group of volunteers, especially. And was kind of a off the cuff mission to the point where,

10:23.240 --> 10:28.440
remember, Mike was an M249 saw gunner. And here on this mission, he claims he was handed an M16A4

10:28.440 --> 10:33.560
200 Norwegian Kronath. I know that. Thank you for that. I really appreciate that. Also,

10:33.560 --> 10:37.240
Norway is one of my favorite countries on the earth. I was just in Oslo last September.

10:37.240 --> 10:42.920
But so just kind of ironing out some of those details. And before I continue, you have anything

10:42.920 --> 10:49.880
to add? I think one of the other inconsistencies was like, I think it was stated that like they

10:49.880 --> 10:55.640
saw the UFO from the LZM, but they didn't see anything until they got to the top of the hill.

10:57.320 --> 11:02.440
But yeah, the other questions, I mean, really addressing Nathan's stuff was kind of just a

11:02.440 --> 11:09.480
small part of the interview. A lot of it was focused on things that I noticed like small

11:09.480 --> 11:17.800
details or kind of gaps in time of his testimony where he might have skipped from one thing and

11:17.880 --> 11:21.480
kind of like went to the next thing. And there, you know, maybe there was like a half hour in

11:21.480 --> 11:27.880
between that kind of is fuzzy, you know, that he has never talked about. And so I tried to

11:27.880 --> 11:36.040
identify some of those areas that would help kind of add context to the situation. And we also

11:36.040 --> 11:41.480
talked about the inside. Yes. One of the things I'm really glad Michael talked about in this

11:41.480 --> 11:47.240
interview because he's only kind of mentioned it kind of halfway or just in passing, but he

11:47.240 --> 11:51.800
actually told us the story and did it live. We'll have it in the interview kind of how

11:51.800 --> 11:56.040
he came in contact with the insider because he's just said before, oh, this insider contacted him.

11:56.600 --> 12:03.960
If we remember to the NPC 2023, that was June 12. June 9th or 10th is when the Daily Mail

12:03.960 --> 12:10.200
article came out. That was about Herrera's story. Pre Greer's NPC 2023, there was actually a three

12:10.200 --> 12:16.520
day kind of closed private event. And that's where Michael first gave his testimony in a

12:16.520 --> 12:23.000
private setting. And it was here that the insider was at this event. And once Michael gave his

12:23.000 --> 12:28.280
testimony, Michael says that the insider kind of talked to Greer said, I know what this is,

12:28.280 --> 12:32.680
let me try and connect with Michael. And after a little bit of phone tag with Greer and this insider,

12:34.200 --> 12:39.960
they finally connected and this insider invited him out to this location. That is so infamous

12:39.960 --> 12:47.560
now, kind of the most infamous part of Michael's story. Yeah. And for me, so you guys have to

12:47.560 --> 12:52.200
understand when this was all unfolding, I was in direct contact with Michael.

12:58.600 --> 13:02.920
First of all, he told me this insider wanted to meet him. I was like super skeptical.

13:03.640 --> 13:10.280
It sounded like what are the chances you have like a UFO witness, and all of a sudden,

13:10.280 --> 13:16.360
someone in the black program is going to wants to meet them. So I was super skeptical, but

13:18.040 --> 13:22.760
I had a phone call with him the day before the meeting. That phone call has since been,

13:22.760 --> 13:28.760
we've published that on the video that you and I did together a few months back. I kind of hear

13:28.840 --> 13:35.080
a clip of that video, but in it you can see like I was given certain details about the location and

13:36.600 --> 13:41.960
timing of that meeting. And ultimately,

13:44.760 --> 13:53.800
I was able to obtain some evidence that proved Michael was on a specific helicopter.

13:54.360 --> 14:00.120
And so I was able to track that helicopter without Michael's knowledge. And I could see exactly where

14:00.120 --> 14:05.640
that helicopter went that day. I didn't tell Michael about this, you know, right at the start.

14:05.640 --> 14:10.760
You know, once he got back, I spoke with him and said, you know, I started asking him some questions

14:10.760 --> 14:16.600
and, you know, asked him like what time does he remember them taking off stuff like that. And

14:16.600 --> 14:25.160
just like everything was lining up. I also, well, so one thing is at this point, you're

14:25.160 --> 14:32.280
fully kind of read in on all of that evidence. Yeah. So, A, thank you so much. That's a cool name.

14:32.280 --> 14:39.560
And I appreciate you so much. That's so kind of you. But B, the kind of a, yeah, let me,

14:39.560 --> 14:46.040
let's get to this to kind of, but so a lot of this evidence about that initial meeting was

14:46.840 --> 14:53.240
a helicopter kind of a visit to this location. Joey was able to track down with multiple pieces

14:53.240 --> 14:59.880
of self-confirming data from kind of publicly available flight records. And I like, I don't

14:59.880 --> 15:03.320
know how much I want to say about it. So you tell me some of the pieces that help that. Yeah. I mean,

15:04.920 --> 15:10.760
the reason why it might have to be vague about like the main piece of evidence I use is like

15:11.000 --> 15:18.840
the nature in which it was obtained could kind of compromise certain things. So,

15:19.720 --> 15:25.160
and it's been really frustrating for me, you know, at the time, you know, I eventually revealed to

15:25.160 --> 15:33.960
Michael like, hey, I tracked the helicopter and he was like, holy crap. And, you know, at the time,

15:33.960 --> 15:39.320
I felt it was important to reach out to certain people, you know, certain journalists,

15:40.040 --> 15:48.440
certain like podcasters, things like that. And just explains him to them that like, look, Michael's

15:48.440 --> 15:53.640
not lying about this insider. Like this meeting happened, you know, like, I can't prove the

15:53.640 --> 16:00.280
insider is who he is. But I know he went to this location that's like, I know where he went.

16:00.920 --> 16:06.440
Herb knows exactly where he went. And it's, it's like a very interesting location. Yeah,

16:06.920 --> 16:12.840
that's what makes things so weird because there's still a lot of like people and still a lot of

16:12.840 --> 16:16.600
valid thoughts about, you know, is this guy disinformation? Like I totally understand that

16:16.600 --> 16:21.720
point of view. It's totally, you know, that's kind of where my mind drifted initially to

16:23.480 --> 16:29.960
puzzle the helicopter. But Joey also, what's the question? The helicopter equals insider.

16:30.920 --> 16:38.120
Okay. Can you name the location, Bernie, Rob? I cannot. That's not my, that's not my location.

16:38.120 --> 16:45.400
So, well, let me, let me address this question here. So I'm not, you're basically kind of saying,

16:45.400 --> 16:53.960
like, am I taking evidence of a helicopter to mean that I know the insider's real? No, that's not,

16:54.040 --> 17:01.480
that's not it. It's so initially it was the nature in which he took him to this location

17:02.440 --> 17:11.640
just said to me that this guy at the very least has to be some sort of high level person to be

17:11.640 --> 17:22.200
able to take him where he took him in the nature in which he did that. But now I have, I mean, we have

17:22.200 --> 17:32.440
like third party corroboration of this insider from multiple very trusted people. Yeah, it kind

17:32.440 --> 17:37.240
of overlines that. If you guys watched my, my witnesses one video with the story of, and that's

17:37.240 --> 17:41.320
what I'm talking about, Doug Way. And I linked that YouTube video that's kind of talking about Area

17:41.320 --> 17:48.680
51, stuff being moved to Doug Way or Weiner. Let me get to that in one second. But thank you so much.

17:48.760 --> 17:54.680
But in that documentary I linked it shows like random citizens pulling up to Doug Way, right,

17:54.680 --> 17:58.360
which is this location is not Doug Way, but random citizens being pulled up to Doug Way,

17:58.360 --> 18:02.360
getting approached by men at arms, being held at gunpoint, being approached by Apache helicopters.

18:02.920 --> 18:07.320
If this was just some random dude taking Michael to this location, they would have been pulled

18:07.320 --> 18:14.200
up on and probably detained because it is a, it's not a Starbucks, right? Like he didn't get

18:14.920 --> 18:19.480
introduced to Starbucks or something like that. Real fast, before we keep talking about that,

18:19.480 --> 18:24.440
Ort Weiner, no, I have not heard back from TV. I will probably not be talking to him again unless

18:24.440 --> 18:31.320
he becomes a, but yeah, I'll probably just let him, I don't, I don't really want to infringe on his

18:31.320 --> 18:40.120
privacy anymore. But keep going. Yeah, so when I started reaching out to these different, you

18:40.120 --> 18:48.520
know, journalists and podcasters who, you know, and I wanted, I just wanted just to say like,

18:49.320 --> 18:54.360
Michael's not lying about this one thing, because I felt like it would just elevate,

18:54.360 --> 18:59.560
you know, kind of the stand that like the base level of trust, instead of just kind of, you know,

19:01.960 --> 19:07.000
just, you know, interviewing him or talking to him without having that information. Now,

19:07.080 --> 19:14.200
unfortunately, I had to censor kind of key parts of that evidence. When I was doing these,

19:14.200 --> 19:19.800
these calls with these people, most of them, there's a couple, I did share the full evidence,

19:19.800 --> 19:27.160
and they were able to verify it and know the location. Verb here now, at this point, Michael

19:27.160 --> 19:33.800
has, you know, given him the trust to be kind of like fully read in on that. So I'm like, I'm,

19:34.040 --> 19:39.720
I just have such a relief and weight off my shoulders to finally have like someone else,

19:40.280 --> 19:46.680
other than me, just being like, yeah, guys, trust me, who has seen the full picture of,

19:46.680 --> 19:54.120
of like evidence of this meeting, who can kind of, you know, talk about it and be like, yeah,

19:54.120 --> 20:02.440
I'm not an idiot. And like, do you think the insider has proof that Michael is saying the

20:02.440 --> 20:07.000
truth or the insider just trusts Michael's story? Michael has said that the reason he

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
was taken to this location is because the insider told him he would be shown proof to corroborate

20:11.000 --> 20:20.360
his story. And I think that's probably like a pretty fair guess, guess to say that, you know,

20:20.920 --> 20:25.160
some elements of Michael's story he felt were corroborated. Bertie, I do want to tell you this,

20:25.160 --> 20:30.920
this insider, I do not think it's in Taylor. Yeah, so no, just to, just if I could address this

20:30.920 --> 20:40.680
question to you, I think 100% the insider knows Michael's telling the truth. Like, like, if the

20:40.680 --> 20:47.000
insider is who he says he is, like, just logically, it doesn't make sense if he wouldn't, if he didn't

20:47.000 --> 20:55.080
believe him. And the whole thing is like, the insider allegedly, you know, is familiar with

20:55.080 --> 21:01.800
these types of operations. And that was, you know, one of the reasons why he wanted to,

21:03.320 --> 21:06.920
you know, build a relationship with Michael. And actually, this was one of the questions I had

21:06.920 --> 21:15.160
during the interview with Michael was like, why did he need or want you to kind of have this

21:15.160 --> 21:19.640
relationship and stuff. And so Michael kind of goes into that. And it makes a lot of sense,

21:19.720 --> 21:25.880
in my opinion, you know, kind of why they have this sort of mutual relationship and

21:26.840 --> 21:31.800
what the insider is getting out of it from Michael. And I've struggled and grappled with this,

21:31.800 --> 21:35.720
just Michael's whole story so much. Because if you guys remember the first video I ever did,

21:36.280 --> 21:41.240
a couple months ago, I straight up still told I was extremely skeptical of Michael and didn't,

21:41.240 --> 21:45.240
didn't, kind of didn't believe him over time. And especially talking to Michael, some of the,

21:45.800 --> 21:50.440
some of the confirming elements of just meeting the insider and so forth is so strange to me.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.640
I, I don't know kind of what the, the future of this entails or really the,

21:55.640 --> 22:01.080
the consequence this holds to Michael or even what he saw. I still don't know that I really

22:01.080 --> 22:07.080
would like to know, but it's such a weird story. And I think in this, this interview, which I saw

22:07.080 --> 22:10.600
somebody asking, was it going to be out? I'm trying to add it all right now. So I will get it out this

22:10.680 --> 22:17.960
week. But I, I just feel like this week, I know, but the people want to see it, right? I want to

22:17.960 --> 22:22.520
get this video. I'm so excited. But it's just, it's such an interesting story. And I really do

22:22.520 --> 22:26.760
understand it. So I want to touch back to why some people don't believe the Michael story, but

22:26.760 --> 22:33.000
the craft, Bernie, the craft he saw was a pretty, was octagonal, kind of octagonal shape. Yeah,

22:33.000 --> 22:39.160
throw that up there. I mean, this is just a sketch, but yeah, there's, there's some better

22:39.160 --> 22:45.480
drawings and kind of renderings of, of the craft that he described. Oh, we also, sorry,

22:45.480 --> 22:50.760
I don't want to track. I was just going to say, Oh, okay. How much do you trust Steven Greer?

22:50.760 --> 22:56.520
That is a loaded question. How much do I trust Steven Greer right now? Probably a two. How much

22:56.520 --> 23:01.640
do I trust Steven Greer's database and just people who have contacted him? Because most of the

23:01.640 --> 23:08.200
witnesses that I found and so forth just reached out to Greer, not contacted him. High confidence in

23:09.160 --> 23:15.080
a lot of those people. But Greer, I've made it well known. You know, maybe I haven't seen it for

23:15.080 --> 23:20.520
myself. So I don't know if the CE five is, is legit or anything like that. I don't know. I,

23:20.520 --> 23:26.280
that's weird. That's kind of strange to me. But I don't think, I think, I think Greer's got a huge

23:26.280 --> 23:31.000
ego. I think he just kind of wants to possess his own witnesses. For example, Michael talk,

23:31.000 --> 23:35.400
I think this was on the total disclosure podcast. But of course, his story came out through Greer.

23:35.400 --> 23:39.800
He kind of maybe would have gone through different routes if he knew now, but he specifically

23:39.800 --> 23:44.600
mentioned Greer either purposefully or mis-purposefully lying about his case. When he's had the men

23:44.600 --> 23:50.040
of black operators, when they were pulling guns on them, Greer had said overdramatized the story

23:50.040 --> 23:54.440
saying that the men made the Marines kind of get on their knees, turn around, guns pointing back to

23:54.440 --> 24:00.760
their head, like almost a movie level of kind of drama. And so this happens with Michael and who

24:00.760 --> 24:05.080
knows what other people he's talked about. It just kind of stretches the story, but just stretches

24:05.160 --> 24:12.760
things a little bit. I think, I think if Greer eased back on the ego a bit and trying to

24:12.760 --> 24:17.400
grift people for thousands of dollars for CE5 stuff, he'd be taken home more seriously.

24:17.400 --> 24:23.160
But he's just an enigma to me, man. I don't know, because if you guys have read the 2001 disclosure

24:23.160 --> 24:27.400
project briefing document, that's what, I think that is really a document, runs it back. It's

24:27.400 --> 24:32.840
fantastic. And so that was in 2001 and 97. Where did he go wrong? That now he's trying to command

24:32.840 --> 24:38.600
Lordship or people who contact him? I don't know. And also, like if you go through the,

24:39.240 --> 24:43.880
if you go through the DPI archive, some of those documents he's uploaded, and I kind of felt guilty

24:43.880 --> 24:48.280
about pulling through some of these, say they're protected by Dr. Client Privileges. Why is he posting

24:48.280 --> 24:53.320
this stuff? It's immoral. It's absolutely immoral that he's doing that. And sometimes I feel bad

24:53.320 --> 24:59.400
looking through that stuff, but I don't know, man. I don't like it. Interesting to know if Michael

24:59.400 --> 25:05.720
has talked about masonry or if you have any thoughts on that. Michael was wearing a masonic pin

25:05.720 --> 25:09.800
and he outs talked to us because of course that's so interesting. He just kind of told us that he

25:09.800 --> 25:14.680
joined masonry because he kind of liked the kind of wealth oriented mindset and joining the group

25:14.680 --> 25:19.240
of people and so forth. So for him, he wasn't a native mason like family wise. I don't even know

25:19.240 --> 25:25.720
how joining masonry works, but he just joined pretty young, I think at 18. At 18? Yeah. Yeah.

25:25.720 --> 25:33.480
But yeah, I mean, he appreciates a lot of the history behind it. And he's talked about,

25:34.200 --> 25:38.280
he's kind of addressed the conspiracy theories and stuff like that and

25:39.640 --> 25:44.360
on kind of other interviews and whatnot. But yeah, I mean, like the wealth aspect,

25:45.400 --> 25:51.320
like we toured his business and it's an incredibly complex organization,

25:51.720 --> 25:57.800
yeah, incredibly impressive. It's an eight figure business just by looking at it.

25:57.800 --> 26:04.520
It's about no other panel. Oh, yeah, I don't remember what that was. He addressed that on the

26:04.520 --> 26:08.280
total disclosure. Okay, I need to check it out. I checked where the pity was wearing. Yeah.

26:09.480 --> 26:15.240
But we also talked about Kirkpatrick. Oh, yes. Okay. Yeah, guys, this is gonna be

26:15.880 --> 26:20.600
really great too. I live in a birdie. If you're in Kentucky, my pops lives in Pendleton. I'm

26:20.600 --> 26:27.240
out there all the time. I love Pendleton. So I'll get to this in one second, but

26:27.800 --> 26:33.560
Arrow. So yeah, Michael did testify to Arrow and in the interview, he talks at length about that.

26:33.560 --> 26:38.040
He testified directly to Kirkpatrick and we'll just give a little details. He, this

26:39.000 --> 26:48.040
Jimmie, is that okay? Can you thank you? And I really appreciate that. The last time,

26:48.040 --> 26:54.280
I'm splitting that one with you, man. I don't want anything. I really appreciate that. Thank you

26:54.280 --> 26:59.880
so much, Jimmie. I really appreciate that. That is so kind of you. Seriously, from the bottom of

26:59.880 --> 27:05.400
my heart. But Arrow, so he testified directly to Arrow. There were a couple people in the room.

27:06.040 --> 27:10.680
Michael said that Dr. Kirkpatrick sat lean back with his legs crossed the whole time,

27:10.680 --> 27:16.280
asked three questions about Indonesia, three questions because he testified in April of 2023.

27:16.280 --> 27:23.560
So before the NPC 2023 with Greer, he said, Kirkpatrick asked three times the same question.

27:23.560 --> 27:28.120
He said three questions, but they were the same question. He didn't type anything down. He just

27:28.120 --> 27:33.240
had some handwritten notes. After that, Kirkpatrick and Arrow told him they would be following up

27:33.240 --> 27:37.640
and they never did. He never heard from them again. And he was also surprised and pretty

27:38.680 --> 27:42.760
angered when he saw historical report volume one and saw that it was completely

27:43.720 --> 27:49.320
kind of falsifying his testimony to Arrow. You're supposed to like, as a content creator,

27:49.320 --> 27:55.560
you got to like leave teases. You spoiled it. But still, you got to stop. I don't want to.

27:56.360 --> 28:01.000
See, that's what I like about you. You're not like leaning into all the like kind of work.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.760
No, I'm not going to do trailers. No, it's awesome. He thought Kirkpatrick was a total jerk.

28:07.960 --> 28:12.200
So yeah, the question was like, who were the operators? That was like the one thing that he

28:12.920 --> 28:16.040
was focused in on. He didn't ask anything else.

28:19.160 --> 28:24.920
This, for what, yes, I've tried to find that person. That's in the emails. Also,

28:24.920 --> 28:29.640
tried to talk to John Stuart. I've heard some kind of positive and negative things on that

28:29.640 --> 28:33.240
encounter. So I really am trying to get to the bottom of it, as well as the strange connection

28:33.240 --> 28:38.760
to the 1974 Chihuahua Mexico crash retrieval case. I want to cover it. That occurred in

28:38.760 --> 28:45.960
Cuyome, Mexico in 1974. Supposedly a crash, UAP, a disk collided with a small Cessna airplane.

28:45.960 --> 28:51.320
Mexican authorities retrieved the craft. A United States kind of insurgency team killed those people

28:51.320 --> 28:55.240
and took the craft. So that's all I know about that. I know data, anything to back that up now,

28:55.240 --> 29:00.520
but I will cover that case. Bernie, yes, if you've seen the disclosure project and you've seen

29:00.520 --> 29:05.880
witness A or B, I can't remember which, I'm trying to find that person. They said he was Boeing

29:05.880 --> 29:11.160
and locking Skogwork. So I'm trying to track down who that person is. I know his name because it's

29:11.160 --> 29:15.880
actually listed, not redacted in the, in the career files, which is crazy because if you read

29:15.880 --> 29:21.480
the disclosure project, it says AH, that's the name, AH, but in the career witness list, his name

29:21.480 --> 29:27.720
is unredacted. So I won't hide that. If somebody beats me to finding him, fair play. But yeah,

29:27.720 --> 29:30.360
I'm trying to track down that guy. I have a friend of a friend whose father's management

29:30.360 --> 29:35.160
Skogwork's in the 2000s. Bernie, Rob, if you want to talk about UAP, tell him to contact me, please.

29:35.160 --> 29:38.520
Yeah, it's been, it's been so cool to just kind of shadow over

29:39.080 --> 29:45.800
Gerb these past few days. I mean, I think within the span of like a few days, like you've made

29:45.800 --> 29:52.280
like two new contacts, have had conversations with, you know, some, some witnesses.

29:53.640 --> 30:00.520
Like it's incredible. Like the hustle behind here, it's just, it's, it's really cool to see.

30:00.520 --> 30:04.760
Yeah. So I might mention this in another video, but if you guys are watching, I would like to

30:04.840 --> 30:10.840
tell you about something that I found. Another one of Gerr's witnesses I made contact with,

30:10.840 --> 30:15.640
this guy's actually a PhD professor at a university, completely vetted his credentials,

30:16.520 --> 30:20.840
not a first-hand encounter, second-hand encounter. But let me tell you about the second-hand

30:20.840 --> 30:24.680
encounter. I have no more data on it than just speaking to this gentleman the other day.

30:24.680 --> 30:27.880
He's actually a good point of contact. He's actually in Colorado, so I'd like to talk to him

30:27.880 --> 30:33.800
more. But when he was in university for his PhD, are we going to see Michael in documentaries or

30:33.880 --> 30:38.360
hearings? We'll get to that right after this story. While doing, while getting his PhD,

30:38.360 --> 30:45.800
one of his professors was an army electrical engineer. And this is Jim, Jim, Jim there.

30:46.840 --> 30:56.040
Jim. Wow. Thank you. You were, I'm just wondering, all right. You like $100, $100 that note to Joey.

30:56.040 --> 31:01.480
Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Jim. That's incredible. Thank you so much. But so this guy has a second

31:01.480 --> 31:07.640
hand encounter, right? His professor in university, getting his PhD, used to be in the army core of

31:07.640 --> 31:11.960
electrical engineers. He used to be an electrical engineer in army engineering. So he told me back

31:11.960 --> 31:16.680
in the 50s, early 50s, I think this might be 53 around the time of Kingman. Hey, I'll get to that

31:16.680 --> 31:21.400
in one second. His professor, while a little liquored up at a party one night, said that one

31:21.400 --> 31:25.560
night in the early 50s, in the middle of the night, he was woken up from his bunk. From his bunk,

31:25.560 --> 31:30.520
he was placed in a bust, driven hours to an airstrip, but in a plate with no windows. If you

31:30.520 --> 31:34.520
remember so far, this sounds oddly similar to Arthur Stansel in the Kingman crash. He's put in

31:34.520 --> 31:39.080
this plane, is flown to a place in the middle of the desert, brought into a building in the middle

31:39.080 --> 31:44.120
of the desert where a bunch of strange objects were in like an industrial laboratory. I told

31:44.120 --> 31:48.680
it, figure out how they work. A couple years later, he asked the same professor, the professor

31:48.680 --> 31:54.280
denied that and said, no, it was Russian objects. So that's a really interesting story. That's the

31:54.280 --> 31:58.600
best one I'm talking about. Well, yeah, because he asked, he said, what were they? And he said,

31:58.680 --> 32:02.760
they're not ours. Yeah, he said, they're not ours. Quote, they're not ours. Yeah. And then later on,

32:02.760 --> 32:08.600
he's like, Oh, I didn't mean any Chai or anything when it was Russian. Yeah. So, but he didn't

32:08.600 --> 32:13.880
believe that. No, you don't believe that because why would a PhD in electrical engineering know

32:13.880 --> 32:19.720
that? So that's an interesting story. Three, three D monster. No, sir, I actually have my degree in

32:19.720 --> 32:27.880
mechanical engineering. Oh, okay. Sorry about that, guys. Still working on this. In documentaries

32:27.880 --> 32:34.760
or hearings, hearings, I would hope so. I know he's, he's willing to kind of testify of approach

32:35.320 --> 32:39.800
documentaries. I'm not quite sure he's, he's kind of like, he doesn't want to do too many

32:39.800 --> 32:44.840
media appearances. One of the reasons he did this interview is just because like, you know,

32:44.840 --> 32:48.760
we've developed a relationship with Michael over the months, but do you have any other insights?

32:49.800 --> 32:55.800
I mean, there's some stuff that I'm vaguely aware of, but I don't, I don't think it's like public yet.

32:57.960 --> 33:06.040
But, you know, one thing I want to just kind of acknowledge as well. I spoke to Ross Colthart,

33:06.040 --> 33:13.240
like last year, very early on, he was actually one of the first people I approached to kind of

33:13.240 --> 33:22.840
share the evidence that I had. And he finally, you know, he did a Reddit AMA a few months ago,

33:23.480 --> 33:30.920
and acknowledge that he's investigating Michael Herrera's case. And I've known this the whole

33:30.920 --> 33:40.120
time. And he also recently in one of his reality check segments, you know, expressed that he finds

33:40.120 --> 33:47.880
what he says he likes Michael, and he finds what he says credible. So I just want to like,

33:48.680 --> 33:56.040
put that out there, you know, in case you guys missed it. This is a very interesting case. And

33:58.120 --> 34:04.520
I mean, at this point, like, there are a lot of things that I know Michael is 100% telling the

34:04.520 --> 34:10.920
truth about. And, you know, of course, there's a lot of things that I don't have the evidence for.

34:10.920 --> 34:17.640
Yeah, plenty. Yeah, like, people call real fast broke Johnny like, where can I find this

34:17.640 --> 34:22.120
custodian filing? Thank you so much. Love you, man. A lot of people call have called Joey Michael's

34:22.120 --> 34:27.480
publicist. But, you know, you don't you do not claim to have all the all the information with

34:27.480 --> 34:33.080
Michael, do you? No, and it's like, you know, there's a lot of times like he in the past,

34:33.080 --> 34:37.240
like he's done interviews. Like, I didn't even know he was doing an interview. And like,

34:37.240 --> 34:44.440
I just see it just like all you guys, you know. But, you know, I did reach out to,

34:44.440 --> 34:53.480
like I said, Ross, and Richard Dolan, and, you know, like Chris Leto yourself. Yeah,

34:53.480 --> 34:58.520
you know, I reach out to you, Steven Deener, because, you know, I knew that they were interested

34:58.520 --> 35:02.040
in talking to Michael. And I was like, Hey, can I just like, you mind if I can talk to them

35:02.040 --> 35:06.280
ahead of time? And Michael put me in touch with them sometimes or sometimes I'd reach out directly.

35:06.920 --> 35:10.120
And I just be like, look, I'd have a private video call with them and just be like, look,

35:10.120 --> 35:14.760
I just want to share this evidence that I have before you talk to Michael so you can see. But

35:14.760 --> 35:19.560
I'm not like at all part of like, court meeting, his appearances or anything like that. So,

35:20.760 --> 35:26.200
yeah, people, for a long time, people thought I was Michael, because like I was anonymous.

35:26.200 --> 35:30.840
Yeah, but now everybody knows you Joey, this dude's a giant man. He's like, six, five,

35:30.840 --> 35:34.600
six, four, he dwarfs me. He dwarfs Michael. But I'm not like built like you. You're,

35:34.600 --> 35:39.480
you're like Jack. Yes, this is, this is Joey right here. Chris Leto.

35:41.240 --> 35:45.880
I think he's gotten such things. Chris Leto is a wonderful man, a good pilot, a fantastic channel.

35:46.520 --> 35:52.200
There was of course a period of time where, you know, the don't die, don't die. He's all dude,

35:52.200 --> 35:58.600
he's a giant. But there was just a period of time. Do you think NASA and Space Force knows?

35:58.600 --> 36:04.600
Space Force, I'm not quite sure. NASA, NASA's had a weird relationship with, with UAP. If you,

36:04.600 --> 36:11.640
if you remember my last video, that kind of NASA back in the 60s and 70s would always claim they

36:11.640 --> 36:18.840
had no kind of interest in studying UAP. But there was a good period of time in 70s, specifically

36:18.840 --> 36:24.120
78 where there were many internal memos with NASA discussing UAP. So I'm not sure to their

36:24.120 --> 36:29.080
extent, like if NASA is involved in black programs and reverse engineering, but NASA is very,

36:29.080 --> 36:33.480
very interesting. Thoughts on Raytheon building UFOs and Antarctica. I've heard nothing about this,

36:33.480 --> 36:39.080
Polaris. If you have anything to share, email me at gmail.com. I'd love to see what you say.

36:39.080 --> 36:43.400
So we'll try to get out of these questions. Get to Patrick's. Okay. Is this, do you think Nathan

36:43.400 --> 36:51.720
was put? No, no. He so yeah. So I got in touch with Nathan pretty early on. And he was extremely

36:51.720 --> 36:56.280
gracious with his time, you know, going back and forth with me, you know, just kind of texting and

36:56.280 --> 37:04.920
chatting. And, you know, quickly found out he is exactly what he says he is. I do not at all think

37:04.920 --> 37:11.480
he's like a paid disinformation agent or anything like that. What I kind of got the vibe was he just

37:11.480 --> 37:16.360
never liked Michael. And I got that vibe from every political member I spoke to, because

37:16.360 --> 37:22.920
you have to understand Michael was not part of their group through boot camp, you know, he was

37:22.920 --> 37:29.880
in a different company. He went UA, which is unauthorized absence from his original company.

37:29.880 --> 37:37.000
He's upfront about that from his very first, you know, coming forward. Yeah. So, you know,

37:37.000 --> 37:41.080
it was nothing he ever was hiding behind. And, you know, people accused him of like trying to hide that.

37:41.720 --> 37:49.000
But so he got transferred to Nathan's company prior to that deployment to Indonesia.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.360
And so all of those guys looked at him and they just think he's like a loser because, you know,

37:54.360 --> 37:59.240
they find out he went UA and, you know, they were bullying him and he just kind of leaned

37:59.240 --> 38:04.680
into it and kind of screwed with them back. And so none of them liked it. So that's what I recognize

38:04.680 --> 38:10.280
for Nathan. And I mean, if you can put yourself in Nathan's shoes and, you know, the guy that you

38:10.280 --> 38:17.880
remember being strange is coming forward with like his really extraordinary claims. And he was his

38:17.880 --> 38:26.040
team leader, you know, at, you know, during that deployment. But, you know, I, so like, I don't

38:26.040 --> 38:34.200
have a military background. So like, I, the, you know, if Michael has said from, from his first,

38:34.200 --> 38:40.840
you know, testimony that the mission he was on was a volunteer pick of people from different

38:40.840 --> 38:45.400
squads. And I think he even said different platoons because there are multiple platoons on the ship.

38:46.040 --> 38:53.080
And so from day one, his testimony has always been that he did not deploy with his assigned

38:53.640 --> 39:01.240
squad. So Nathan was never a part of Michael's testimony. And it's just kind of silly that like

39:01.720 --> 39:07.880
why would Michael, like if Michael was making this up, why would he make up a

39:08.840 --> 39:14.760
fake mission about a UFO? But then after, you know, 14 years of thinking about it and saying,

39:14.760 --> 39:21.400
I'm going to come forward, also decide to lie about the real mission he did with Nathan. That part

39:21.400 --> 39:26.440
has always bothered me. It just makes no sense. Because literally the only thing that puts Nathan's

39:26.440 --> 39:31.640
testimony against Michael is Michael's denial of him going on a mission with him. So he could have

39:31.640 --> 39:36.680
easily just said, yeah, I did two missions. I did one with a volunteer group that, you know,

39:38.600 --> 39:46.760
saw the UAP. And then I did another regular mission with my team leader. And we didn't see

39:46.760 --> 39:53.000
anything on that one. So I'm not sure if there was a second part to that question. We'll explore

39:53.080 --> 39:58.360
through a couple of these. We'll be Milo. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. If you've got

39:58.360 --> 40:03.240
any questions, I will get to them right away. Sorry, we're trying to scroll through these questions.

40:03.240 --> 40:07.800
And I see you anonymous. What do you mean? Let us let us know what you think. Why are you staying

40:07.800 --> 40:11.080
in a trust we grow with million claims? No evidence, because I understand how you feel.

40:11.640 --> 40:15.560
Like here, how you think, why is that that some things are made not made public yet? I like to

40:15.560 --> 40:19.880
think back to David Rush saying a program for reverse engineering and so forth, feudalistic

40:19.880 --> 40:26.040
dominance. And just I still think that over time, there's a lot more interesting parallels to be

40:26.040 --> 40:30.280
drawn to somewhat of a hidden cold war for decades between adversaries and so forth,

40:30.280 --> 40:34.200
kind of a race to understand this technology thoughts on Kirk Patrick's new position.

40:35.640 --> 40:42.600
DOE influence all the time. I do not like Kirk Patrick at all. And I think his interview with

40:42.600 --> 40:48.360
Green Street was pretty funny how part two was just kind of changed to be solely discussing the

40:48.360 --> 40:52.840
2018 Skinwalker Braving. So with the Raytheon stuff, I don't know. I don't know what I think

40:52.840 --> 40:57.000
about Eric Hecker. Some of his claims, I know I'm talking about Michael here and discussing

40:57.000 --> 41:01.560
how I find his claims interesting. The neutrino detector, that's a little bit hard to believe

41:01.560 --> 41:08.200
that the neutrino detector is like a kind of like a weather weapon. I need I need to do more

41:08.200 --> 41:13.640
study than to like have a and just to touch on the why things aren't public yet. I mean,

41:14.440 --> 41:20.760
the group that Michael is working with, with this insider, their pro disclosure,

41:20.760 --> 41:26.040
like this was the whole reason they connected with Michael. They have things going on that

41:26.040 --> 41:31.800
they're trying to, you know, I think if you guys back out and kind of look at disclosure as a whole,

41:31.800 --> 41:37.320
like there's multiple groups of people trying to push disclosure forward from different angles.

41:37.320 --> 41:43.080
You know, you've got the legislation side of things. You have kind of, you know,

41:43.800 --> 41:48.680
intelligence community insiders who weren't read into the program, but kind of have an idea that

41:48.680 --> 41:52.360
there's something going on and they're kind of pushing things forward to try to get things.

41:52.360 --> 41:59.320
And you have people in the program who just can't become public about it because they have,

41:59.320 --> 42:06.040
you know, families and they're at risk. And I think what we're hearing not just from Michael,

42:06.040 --> 42:13.000
but from other sources is that there needs to be more kind of whistleblower protection.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.720
Yeah. Something I experienced outright with TB in it, this is kind of aligns with the whistleblower

42:19.720 --> 42:24.040
protection is part of the reason I don't think he wanted to come forward with career is, you know,

42:24.040 --> 42:28.120
having his name public, he will still lose his pension completely. You guys got a family to

42:28.120 --> 42:32.200
provide for and so forth, but his pension will be completely gone, never get another job in

42:32.200 --> 42:37.320
government. So more whistleblower protection seem to be in place and kind of liquid how

42:37.320 --> 42:42.920
some whistleblowers have been treated a little bit. Do you think the next aero boss,

42:42.920 --> 42:47.240
do you think the next aero boss will be different? Probably not. I think aero is rotten from the

42:47.240 --> 42:52.120
inside out then, but I'd love to be proven wrong. I think there needs to be a large internal

42:52.120 --> 42:57.080
investigation into aero. Let's see what, thank you so much Broke Johnny Live. That's your second

42:57.080 --> 43:01.960
cash donation. I really appreciate you. We do not need any person to film these in 4K.

43:01.960 --> 43:06.600
Yeah, footage is a weird one to me because as we saw on vetted yesterday, there was that dude at

43:06.600 --> 43:12.440
Moopon who presented that crash retrieval photo. And it's just like, footage is a little,

43:12.440 --> 43:17.560
is really hard to kind of authenticate or completely disprove. And at this point for me,

43:17.560 --> 43:22.040
like in my private research, just studying footage is not enough. That's why I try and

43:22.040 --> 43:26.200
talk to all these people. I really just want to speak to people and so forth.

43:26.200 --> 43:31.960
I'm not, thank you for your channel. Thank you so much first, last, I appreciate you.

43:31.960 --> 43:37.880
I want to talk to Anonymous. Yeah, I definitely understand that point of view because there's

43:37.880 --> 43:43.000
a lot of trust me bro stuff with people like Jeremy Corbell. I think with this evidence where

43:43.000 --> 43:47.960
Michael was taken, I think that Joey can't share it because Michael- Well, it would just

43:47.960 --> 43:54.920
compromise the insider. Totally compromise. But like, I totally understand the sentiment and

43:55.480 --> 44:01.560
like, I just, I had a decision. Do I just not say anything publicly, even though I know it's true?

44:02.600 --> 44:08.840
Or what I came up with was a compromise. I said, well, let me reach out to different people who,

44:09.400 --> 44:16.760
you know, the community mostly trusts, you know, different kind of people in the community,

44:17.400 --> 44:22.040
podcasters, journalists and things like that and share that evidence with them. And then they can,

44:22.040 --> 44:28.200
you know, if they think I'm full of baloney, they can call me out on it and shut me down, you know.

44:28.760 --> 44:36.920
What I didn't expect was a lot of them kind of wanted to kind of continue their investigation

44:36.920 --> 44:44.200
privately and not just like come forward and stuff like that. But at the end of the day,

44:44.200 --> 44:52.360
I totally respect and understand the majority of you guys feeling like, you know, this,

44:53.080 --> 44:56.600
you just kind of want to set this aside because that evidence isn't-

44:56.600 --> 44:58.920
That's a good question to touch on too. Very good question.

44:58.920 --> 45:06.840
Why would it compromise the insider? Because this, you know, these guys have kind of a regular job

45:06.840 --> 45:11.720
as well, right? They're like, it's not just like the Black program stuff that they do,

45:11.720 --> 45:17.240
they have kind of a regular job that they do. And so the location would kind of indicate

45:18.520 --> 45:27.080
the people that work there, essentially, you know. So that's why. Well, there's another reason.

45:27.080 --> 45:32.200
So you're working. It's having positive vibes. Thank you, brother. Not to trust me, bro.

45:32.760 --> 45:38.680
Anon, I totally understand your sentiment, man. Like, I would love for Michael to talk about this.

45:38.680 --> 45:44.280
I'd love for this thing insider to be public, but unfortunately, I don't get to call the shots

45:44.280 --> 45:51.960
there. I'm just trying to kind of study this case as best as I can. But, you know, I completely

45:51.960 --> 45:57.160
understand why it's frustrating, especially in a subject where a lot of people make claims

45:57.160 --> 46:02.520
and don't really touch on it. Aztec. Aztec's a really good case I really want to cover.

46:03.240 --> 46:09.400
So if you guys remember to, if you guys remember when I did my Wilson Davis

46:09.400 --> 46:14.280
memo, James, the guy who actually beat the Wilson Davis memo, I become friends with him. He's a

46:14.280 --> 46:20.360
wonderful man, a great person, and he is strongly of the mind that Aztec is a hoax. So I really want

46:20.360 --> 46:25.480
to speak to him and why he does that. Majed Brazil, I really want to cover that too. MacMade

46:25.480 --> 46:31.000
Studios has a terrific kind of a, have you seen that? It's a blender. It's like a recreation of

46:31.080 --> 46:37.160
a grass retreat event. MacMade Studios. Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's super good. It's awesome. Yeah,

46:37.160 --> 46:45.480
it is really good. But yeah, I wish more people would be public, man. Have you verified the guy

46:45.480 --> 46:53.080
that- Yes, this is the second part of your question, Patrick, that I still talk. You know, I don't

46:53.080 --> 47:00.840
want to, I don't want to go too far into this because I don't, yeah, I don't know how much

47:02.040 --> 47:12.680
everyone's comfortable. So to a certain extent, I'll say that I have verified the person who sent

47:12.680 --> 47:21.000
the text, kind of claiming that, so the context is Michael sent a, actually called,

47:22.520 --> 47:27.000
actually this is good to explain because people don't know the context. So Michael called one of

47:27.000 --> 47:34.840
the five Marines who witnessed this event with him to see if they'd be willing to kind of come

47:34.920 --> 47:45.480
forward with him and, you know, be public. And he left a message and the guy replied later,

47:45.480 --> 47:50.360
I think it was several days later, with the text message. And that's why, so like I posted the

47:50.360 --> 47:56.840
text message. I had seen the message like months and months prior and I talked to Michael about it.

47:56.840 --> 48:02.600
I was like, hey, do you think I can post the actual screenshot of the message? And I censored out like

48:02.600 --> 48:06.520
the messages above and people were like, why did, you know, we want to see what was asked and all

48:06.520 --> 48:11.400
that. The reason why it was censored is the text messages involved were from like weeks prior,

48:11.400 --> 48:18.920
months prior. Michael had called him, left the message, but then this person responded via text.

48:18.920 --> 48:25.480
So hopefully that kind of explains it a little bit more. But yeah, I'll just leave it there for

48:25.480 --> 48:31.160
now because, you know, like Michael says, like none of the guys that he witnessed this with

48:32.520 --> 48:37.320
want anything to do with this, you know, like you've got to remember like they all signed NDAs

48:37.320 --> 48:46.520
threatening their lives and jail time and all of that. And Michael kind of, you know, violated

48:46.520 --> 48:52.520
that NDA by coming forward. So I don't want to do anything at all to, you know, kind of

48:53.400 --> 48:59.480
make them upset. And it's just something I'm kind of setting aside for now.

48:59.480 --> 49:04.200
Any noticeable or notable case in Louisiana probably closest, I know, is Cape to Rodeau

49:04.200 --> 49:08.840
1941. And that's a really interesting case. Let's try to get some of these thoughts on

49:08.840 --> 49:12.920
Brandon Fugle and Travis Taylor. I don't have many thoughts or opinions on Brandon Fugle,

49:12.920 --> 49:16.120
to be honest. I do think it's kind of weird. He never followed up with a green street about the

49:17.000 --> 49:23.720
about the Shunker Patrick thing. But I don't have many thoughts or Travis Taylor is the

49:23.720 --> 49:28.120
dude on Skinwalker Ranch, right? Travis Taylor, yeah. I don't know. I've never watched Skinwalker

49:28.120 --> 49:32.200
Ranch. Any TV show, whether it's Ghost Hunters or any reality show. I mean, he's had other

49:34.200 --> 49:37.960
because he has a PhD then. Yeah, he's been involved with UAT.

49:37.960 --> 49:42.520
Tell us now, there's plans are strange. Joel says we are too. I'm really interested in Tums

49:42.520 --> 49:49.160
lately. An interesting kind of piece on that. I don't think it's in print anymore as UFO highway

49:49.160 --> 49:53.960
book. If you get in contact with me, I'll send that to you because it's really interesting.

49:53.960 --> 49:59.240
I don't want to be very confused about the Nazca bodies. There's a website on this,

49:59.240 --> 50:05.480
I want you to check out. Let me pull that up. Sorry, let me pull this up. If you're watching,

50:05.560 --> 50:16.440
if you're interested in the bodies, it's called Crap. It's called alien-alien-project.com and you

50:16.440 --> 50:21.160
can look at the 3D scans of all the bodies and that's just a really cool thing to look at. I don't

50:21.160 --> 50:25.080
really have an opinion on them right now because I haven't studied too much, but it's very strange.

50:26.200 --> 50:32.200
Ryan Roberts, 5K, USD announced who it is. I don't know who it is and so I cannot do that.

50:33.000 --> 50:40.600
Well, where do you think the huge unmovable object that UFO Ross says,

50:40.600 --> 50:46.760
I have heard rumors that this is Pine Gap Australia and I think that that's

50:47.640 --> 50:52.840
probably like a pretty interesting place. I know TV said Seoul, South Korea and I know

50:52.840 --> 50:59.000
there was a pretty good Reddit investigation in South Korea, but I'm not 100% sure if that's

50:59.000 --> 51:05.160
accurate. Recommendations, I don't really dig into this. Yes, dude, just read into tons of

51:05.160 --> 51:10.440
documents. That's all I can say. The way I started this was I'm just a normal dude. I'm kind of an

51:10.440 --> 51:15.320
idiot. I like to get punched in the face for fun. I just read a lot. Speaking of jujitsu.

51:15.960 --> 51:21.480
Yeah, I try and catalog everything I can do. My drink and sauce by the bottle, I do not. Soy

51:21.560 --> 51:28.280
sauce. This is kombucha. It's really good, by the way. Yes, sir, I would love to.

51:28.280 --> 51:33.240
Can we get you cloned, dude? No, I'm not giving you my DNA. That'd be weird. It'd probably be pretty

51:33.240 --> 51:37.960
annoying to hang out with the clone of me. I'm sorry, guys. I'm trying to look through.

51:38.680 --> 51:44.760
Yeah, Xavier, that good shout on Travis Taylor. Yeah, I thought UAP Task Force, he was on UAP

51:44.760 --> 51:51.240
Task Force. Yeah, I completely agree with that. That's something that TV commented on in his emails.

51:51.720 --> 51:56.200
Specifically, University Affiliated Research Centers. I still need to do some digging there,

51:56.200 --> 52:01.400
but I think that there's some interesting things there. Taylor was also on UAP-TF. Yeah, I'm sorry,

52:01.400 --> 52:07.960
I didn't mention that, guys. Thanks, both of you, for bringing that up. I like, of course,

52:07.960 --> 52:11.320
not something that's pretty interesting, but there's, of course, some controversy there.

52:11.960 --> 52:18.200
I like Monop AFD. I like nuclear-based incursion. One of my favorite stories is Bob Jacobs. Of

52:18.200 --> 52:23.480
course, that's a dummy warhead, but you're familiar with Bob Jacobs, right? I love that story. Jesus,

52:23.480 --> 52:30.520
all this. Okay, come on, man. Anyone bring up those new move-on photos? Yeah, we kind of touched

52:30.520 --> 52:37.160
on a little bit. The photos are interesting, of course, but I don't know what to say. It's just

52:37.160 --> 52:41.960
a photo, and I think the dude on the live just wanted to flash it up for a second and bring it

52:41.960 --> 52:47.880
down. I don't know. It's a weird photo. I can't really say anything more than a strange

52:48.280 --> 52:52.840
photo. Yeah, this is really interesting. Blue, Elizondo, and Steven G. Bean are odds with each

52:52.840 --> 52:57.800
other. Gray said that a few thousand four-in-init tic-tacs are man-made ARBs and calls Lou a

52:57.800 --> 53:03.720
disinformation agent. Lou has basically called Gray a fraud. So the whole thing with Green

53:03.720 --> 53:09.080
Street and Lou, I think you guys will probably think is super interesting. I find that super

53:09.080 --> 53:15.800
interesting. There is a strange absence of documents around Lou, and they tip, but I think

53:15.800 --> 53:22.360
Lou is a fantastic person, but he seems like he wants disclosure, and I'm actually kind of

53:22.360 --> 53:30.600
excited for his book. Yeah, you're going to look good. Okay, hey, this is a good point, man.

53:30.600 --> 53:34.760
So what we kind of talked about earlier, when I brought up the 1974 Chihuahua incident,

53:35.560 --> 53:40.840
this is in Kaio-Mei, the same region where sploxide occurs. So we're talking about the

53:40.920 --> 53:46.680
Sentinels of Atheropoeia. Yeah, Sentinels of Atheropoeia 2004, JSA. The insider is kind of

53:47.320 --> 53:54.280
having produced and is going through the officer review right now. So it takes place in this.

53:54.280 --> 54:00.120
So I have a little conspiracy theory that I'm trying to look through that this 1974 Kaio-Mei

54:00.120 --> 54:06.280
case with the American operators taking down the Mexican military retrieval team is the case

54:06.280 --> 54:10.600
referenced in Sentinels of Atheropoeia. I need to keep looking at that, but that's something I

54:11.960 --> 54:16.280
need to keep going through. Has my course to you? Yeah, he's talked about this kind of a lot

54:17.400 --> 54:23.720
in terms of, he said his father has been threatened, and he says he's seen curious

54:24.360 --> 54:29.560
kind of flyovers of helicopters almost circling strafing his place of work and so forth.

54:31.240 --> 54:34.840
You want to touch on that before I get to this next question? Oh, no, that's all right. All right,

54:34.840 --> 54:38.520
contact, arrival, or interstellar. That's a tough question, man, but I got to go with interstellar.

54:39.480 --> 54:44.840
Time and no time for caution, or no time for caution is one of the best film songs of all time.

54:44.840 --> 54:47.480
You've seen interstellar. Yeah, I would say interstellar too. Yeah, the scores.

54:49.720 --> 54:53.160
Interstellar is a fan. All of these are great movies, especially contact. That's

54:53.160 --> 54:57.800
severely underrated with Joni Foster. You've seen that, right? I don't think I have actually, man.

54:57.800 --> 55:04.280
You got to see it. Yeah. That's any idea why JSOC is coming up in here. Yes, because if this

55:05.080 --> 55:08.920
insider is telling the truth, and he's not just a disinfo guy, and he's trying to disseminate

55:08.920 --> 55:14.120
information through Sentinels of Ether, there's a reason why he's bringing up JSOC. I just don't

55:14.120 --> 55:22.040
understand the Sentinels of Ether. No, the disinfo angle with Michael. I also don't get the...

55:22.040 --> 55:26.520
Like, what's the logic, guys? Like, tell me what the logic is. Like, Michael came forward,

55:26.520 --> 55:31.960
most people didn't believe him, and so why would there be a... Like, what's the agenda? I don't

55:31.960 --> 55:39.400
get it. You know, like, I just don't understand. And I mean, at this point, I'm like so confident

55:39.400 --> 55:46.200
that this guy is who he says he is for a variety of reasons. I mean, I don't have, like, definitive

55:46.200 --> 55:52.360
proof, because that would be me going through that black side and seeing it for myself. And

55:52.360 --> 55:56.200
obviously, I didn't do that. So, like, I'm like a couple steps removed from that, I guess.

55:57.160 --> 56:01.080
And Django. That's love, man. And that's a really cute... Do you see that?

56:01.080 --> 56:04.200
Oh, my God. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that.

56:05.720 --> 56:10.360
If not... If non-disclosure, if non-human intelligence exists, do you think government

56:10.360 --> 56:14.200
wouldn't officially say, no, I don't? I don't know how many elements in government officially

56:14.200 --> 56:18.440
know this. I'd like to look back to the early 1950s. This is something I just talked about in

56:18.440 --> 56:24.360
the infographics video, too, within Truman and Eisenhower, and kind of the heavy possibility of

56:24.680 --> 56:29.240
U.S. government elements losing track of the UAP situation at that time. If we look back to the

56:29.240 --> 56:35.080
40s and 50s, you have scientists like Herman Auberth and so forth who you're talking and actually

56:35.080 --> 56:40.360
making flight measurements and estimates of UAP flight characteristics. So, back at this time,

56:40.360 --> 56:45.400
it was pretty well thought out to be non-human intelligence and flying saucers and so forth.

56:45.400 --> 56:51.320
So, I don't think this is going to be done by the people. By the people, hopefully, and I hope

56:51.320 --> 56:55.400
this, people in programs that Grush has talked about, some of his 40 witnesses, these people need

56:55.400 --> 57:03.880
to start to test apart. Yeah. It's kind of an annoying bit of silence. What do you think of

57:03.880 --> 57:07.080
Charles Hall? That name sounds familiar, but I can't remember. Do you know Charles Hall?

57:07.080 --> 57:15.240
So, Julian Grocks, if you can tell me, best favorite UFO photo, my profile picture, 2006

57:15.240 --> 57:20.520
or 2007, Wisconsin, there's a series of two of them. I love this image. I look at it just

57:20.520 --> 57:25.880
something that kind of makes me feel a little scared inside. What do you say? I don't really

57:25.880 --> 57:31.560
have a favorite, but I can respect why you feel like that's really compelling.

57:32.840 --> 57:38.600
It's a great series of images that I'll provide on my community notes. There's a good kind of story

57:38.600 --> 57:44.040
in the summary of the people who took the photos and so forth, and there's two cases of it.

57:44.600 --> 57:49.160
Really interesting. Would you like to hear your research on value authority?

57:49.480 --> 57:52.920
Somebody was talking about Valiant Thor in the Twitter space the other day. That's when I

57:52.920 --> 57:55.640
messaged you and I said, these guys are talking about value authority. Oh, that's right. Yeah.

57:55.640 --> 58:00.600
I first heard about that. I think it was Jason Sands. It was Sands? Yeah, he was on a live. He was

58:00.600 --> 58:05.720
on an X space, rather. Okay, Valiant Thor, for any of you who don't know, Valiant Thor is like a

58:05.720 --> 58:11.720
supposed Venusian extraterrestrial that came down in the, I think Eisenhower administration

58:11.720 --> 58:16.120
and basically worked in the Pentagon. I first heard about this on a podcast called Mysterious

58:16.120 --> 58:19.720
Universe. It's a really good podcast. It's a little tongue-in-cheeked, a little silly. If any of

58:19.720 --> 58:25.720
you guys have heard that, I absolutely love that podcast. But that story is a bit, I mean, I have

58:25.720 --> 58:30.840
no confirming evidence or things to disprove the story, but I find it a little strange that

58:30.840 --> 58:37.560
basically an uncanny valley type human is working in the Pentagon, but I don't know. I don't have

58:37.560 --> 58:43.880
anything to, I don't have anything to debunk that story, but I do find it a little strange.

58:44.120 --> 58:51.400
Let's keep seeing. I do agree with what DeLaunch had on Steve's pot about Valiant Thor. I don't

58:51.400 --> 58:58.600
know what he said, so if you know what he said, please let me know. Ross Holt Hart said it is

58:58.600 --> 59:07.400
a psionic. Yeah, so the psionic in the, I think that was in the AMA, you know, like what's one

59:07.400 --> 59:12.920
word everyone should be looking into to kind of push things forward or learn more about what's

59:12.920 --> 59:21.080
going on. He said psionic. And from my perspective, that is a 100% direct reference to Michael's

59:21.080 --> 59:28.520
testimony, you know, relaying information from the insider. Okay, that's my opinion.

59:29.880 --> 59:39.240
And I'll just repeat that Ross is actively investigating Michael's case and finds it incredible.

59:39.240 --> 59:44.280
I'll say that I have not talked to Ross, especially about Michael. So like, I can't add

59:44.280 --> 59:49.800
anything there. I would love to speak to Ross, but no, like, I know you've talked to Ross, but I have

59:49.800 --> 59:55.080
not. Yeah, I've not spoken to Ross. So I mean, I could be wrong, but like that word for me, the

59:55.080 --> 01:00:00.520
first, I never heard psionic until Michael brought it up. And that was like a big part of, you know,

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:06.280
the whole, the whole thing with, I think I first heard about like psionic stuff back in like 20,

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:11.000
I can't remember the 2020s when those supposed A tip slides leaked from Chris Mellon's personal

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.240
website. I think it's slide nine, which talks like what's considered like the phenomenon is not

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:20.280
considered quantum physics and talk about kind of a consciousness affecting of being approximately

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:25.960
the UAP and so forth. So that is super, super interesting. I don't know because, you know,

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:31.160
I'm not a psychic. If I was, I'd make better YouTube videos, but I'm not a psychic. I don't

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:35.000
know anybody not psychic. So that of course is one of the toughest things for me to wrap my head

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.880
around. What soft disclosure points? I don't know because you have close encounters of the third

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.680
kind and you have a really weird, you have a lot of parallels to real life, like that eccentric

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:50.040
French scientist who is basically a movie analog analog to a Jacques Valais and the J. Allen,

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:55.320
Heineck type scientists. So I don't know, but that I'd be interested to find out. I agree.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.720
Jay Sock was also mentioned in the article exposing the OGA. Yes, the OGA is something I'm

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.880
trying to invent investigate right now as we speak. I think that's so interesting. There's a couple

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:09.400
guys I'm talking to that have some poignant points on OGA and my car wolf, the former head and so

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.120
forth. So that'd be interesting. All right. What does this say? So David Gruss has confirmed that

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:19.160
deep state is real thoughts on the legitimacy of the USA government. Democracy is fake. I definitely

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:24.760
think there is a program that studies reverse engineering. We're like looking around the camera

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.000
questions to see the questions. At least from everything I've studied, I'd like to support

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.560
the thesis that there is evidence that there is a crash retrieval in reverse engineering

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:39.720
project that is not necessarily run by USG elements with oversight. Yeah. I mean, this stuff,

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:47.160
this stuff's so crazy, guys. Like I totally understand that. I mean, it's, it's, I don't know.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:54.760
It's, I really don't know. It's just recalculation. Wait, but the text message from his bussy who

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:05.320
tells him he isn't too deep. I think your comments more common. Okay, let's keep going through.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.080
I don't know if I consider her at this info, but the play devil's advocate would definitely

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.640
be value in elevating false whistleblowers to discredit people indirectly the whole prospect.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:22.520
Yeah, totally agree. And I didn't think at the 2023, there's some kind of a little bit of false

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:27.640
whistleblowers and so forth. Well, one, one thing I don't understand, like people kind of

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:33.160
call this a Dodie Benowitz situation. And the thing I don't understand about that at all is,

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:40.760
you know, Benowitz didn't have the same type of experience that Herrera did. Benowitz intercepted

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:46.040
communications, if I'm correct. Yeah, I think it was near Mallory. No, no, that's Kenneth Arnold

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:51.240
near a kind of like a plateau. He thought he was intercepting like communication between

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:59.080
NHI and so Dodie came in and like supported that idea and like egged it on. This is like the

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:08.280
opposite. Like Michael saw anti gravity craft. It flew off. There's like no mistaking what his

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:15.240
testimony is from his perspective. So it makes no sense if Michael was making this up.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.920
How could an insider come in and like egg him on about it being like, Oh, yeah, I saw the operation

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:27.320
you came, you stumbled upon. If Michael knows he's making it up, you would know the insider is lying

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:32.440
to him about, you know, knowing what operation he stumbled upon. So I just, I just don't even see the

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:38.360
logic of how that would work. So I kind of find that that comparison a little silly. Yeah, I need

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:43.960
to let's let's scroll keep going through. Sorry, we're trying to get through all these whack-a-mechs.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.200
Much love, brother. Thank you. What do you think about the idea of agreements with NHI?

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.560
It's really interesting. David Gresh has commented on that as pretty much fact.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:57.720
One of the things that I remember is I think it's 1954, Holloman Air Force based landing

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:02.040
with Eisenhower coming down to contact extra terrestrials and making some agreement with

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.760
them. There's stories that this is to allow extra terrestrials to do abductions and so forth.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:13.320
And Greer has some interesting whistleblowers in his log that talked about observing like the 54

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.400
Holloman landing, what these agreements could be, why these agreements are with people that live in

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:23.800
this continent and not others, or if Russia is going to come out and say that Russia, China has

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:28.360
their own agreements. I don't know. I find it really interesting, but I struggle a lot to find out,

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:36.120
to think what those agreements could be. Why would an NHI, why would a NHI species need to

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:41.400
make agreements with humans? Yeah, I mean, it's like a lot of speculation. I really don't know.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:46.280
Yeah, speculation. And there's some pretty interesting stories around there, but I really

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.640
hope we can get to the bottom of that or hear more from Gresh because I don't know.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:55.720
I mean, he alluded to it. No, no, no. He said in a Ross Bullard interview in the first one,

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:01.320
the News Nation one, Ross says something like an agreement has been made with NHI and Gresh says,

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:07.720
yeah. So I don't know. Wait, is that the Joey? Yes, this is the Joey, man. This is Joey. It's not

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.000
my name. I mean, my name's not Joey, but I am Joey. It's not my name.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.920
Quitter. Yeah, I struggle with this every day. The abduction, psionic ET communication is the

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:26.520
hardest part for me to wrap my head around. Yeah, and honestly, guys, I seriously think I've got

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.560
this cognitive dissonance sometimes when I'm investigating this case, and I focus in on the

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:38.040
tangible stuff that, you know, is in my kind of reality of what the real world is like. And so

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:43.640
I focus on the military stuff, the operation and things like that. And I kind of like take

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:51.720
a bigger, crazy picture of what Michael's claiming and just set it aside. Because like,

01:05:51.720 --> 01:06:01.160
it's such a wild change for like how I understand what works, that it's hard for me to really accept

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:06.440
it. Yeah, it's something like I'm actively studying to learn more about. But, you know, for

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.760
somebody with an engineering background who's really interested in craft,

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:15.160
pressure, trivose, more so tangible stuff, it's really difficult for me to understand, especially

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:19.800
because, you know, I've had no like personal experiences with any sort of psychicness.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:27.480
Laxative pain is out of play on Max pain. Thank you so much. Just dropping the Max pain right in

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:33.640
there. Oh, hey, that was a good game. Max pain three is going on. I played the OG Max pain

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:39.880
for those kind of slow and the activist GTA. I'll check that out tonight, man. Fose 1997. I

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:47.400
really appreciate you brother. Thoughts on Ashton and the NH three 70 videos. I don't know much.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:52.840
I try to stay out of that because that seems like a really big kind of a rabbit hole. I have heard

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:59.800
many people say that those are debunked, but I really don't know, man. I try to say out of that.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:04.600
I remember when that video was released, I was like, holy crap, that's really cool. I really don't

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:14.520
know much to be honest. What about you? Yeah, I mean, it's, it seems pretty compelling that they're

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:25.480
hoaxed. However, and I don't really like Ashton's reaction to a lot of really logical kind of

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:31.160
presentations like the raw the raw photos finding the original photographer took the raw photos of

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:38.360
the clouds and the sequence and he's kind of, you know, comebacks to those are relatively weak and

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:44.440
kind of emotional reactions. However, there are certain things that I find interesting

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:56.760
about the context of the way the videos were put together, I guess, and it makes me almost

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:05.480
wonder if maybe they are hoaxed, but maybe they're hoaxed by a high level government

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:11.800
not just a senior person, not just like a random dude like in his basement, but like maybe this was

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:19.800
a kind of official like project to put this out for some sort of reason because there's

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:23.880
there's things about the satellite, like the specific satellite that was, you know, supposedly

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:30.200
taking images that like how would the person know this within the timeframe and just like the

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:35.240
alignment of a lot of different things. And so there's a lot of, I haven't gone too deep into

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:42.040
it, I've really just focused on Herrera's case, but and I don't like how Ashton is handling

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:49.160
a lot of the criticisms and stuff, but there's still like a little piece there that I do find

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:54.520
interesting. Matt Ford announced that maybe the OGA has changed recently. Yeah, I remember

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.360
when that Daily Mail article about the OGA came out too, there seemed to be a lot of

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:02.280
kind of changes from the internet archive on kind of the flow of information from how to access the

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.480
OGA. The OGA is super interesting. Sorry, just trying to scroll through some of the questions.

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:14.440
Should I still report it to move on? Edward, tell me, man. Send me an email. I want to hear

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.560
about it. You might be good about gmail.com, gata scamming. I want to hear about your experience,

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.400
man. That sounds incredible. This is a great question. What are your opinions on, I think

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:27.160
that was a really bad idea for you to come down with on Twitter. Yeah, unfortunately, and I think

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:37.400
part of the thing that I think Mr. Sands made as a kind of mistake was going too much into being

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:43.320
too generous with providing his speculative thoughts on different questions that were totally

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:52.440
unrelated to his direct experience of what his encounter and his job. Because what happens is

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:58.680
now people get that sound bite and they think he's speaking that from a firsthand perspective

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:05.880
and it just kind of muddies the water. One thing that's interesting that I think we can talk about

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:12.680
regarding Sands, so we actually had another meeting yesterday with Michael and another individual

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.800
who was kind of behind the scenes. He's someone in the intelligence community,

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:27.480
someone I've been speaking to for a while, and he kind of vouched for the fact that Jason Sands

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.600
was participating in the UAP Task Force Forum. So there was some, you know, that you guys probably

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:38.920
remember that argument about, you know, Sands said he was part of the UAP Task Force and

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.920
but then he's like, well, I mean the forum and people kind of flipped out about that.

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:53.160
But from what this IC person that we saw yesterday kind of explained to us was like,

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.920
that's kind of how it was. There was like the UAP Task Force Forum was kind of this,

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:05.880
it's essentially like a collaborative platform that's behind, you know, a top secret clearance,

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:12.120
but it's accessible to a wide range of intelligence community individuals. And so what was happening

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:18.040
was people who were officially part of the UAP Task Force might reach out to someone in the

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:23.640
NGA or something and be like, oh, have you guys seen this or that? And like, you know,

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.760
people who had a personal interest in UAP could just jump in there and kind of like be like,

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.800
on the side, like do a little bit of research and like, you know, give it to the task force.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:40.200
And so it was kind of, you know, the way I kind of understand it is like, you kind of felt like

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.200
you were part of the UAP Task Force if you were just part of that group. It's kind of like if

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.200
you're on like a discord chat, you would say like, oh yeah, I'm part of that group. Yeah. You know,

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.160
if you're, you know, so the way, yeah, the way we heard is you participated in kind of this forum,

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.880
so forth, kind of contributed to the UAP Task Force. And that's when he told the story.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.720
And kind of a lot of really interesting people kind of find Sam's credible or think he's just

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.360
a fantastic person. They have wonderful things to say. Yeah. I mean, like his character alone,

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:15.800
I've only heard very positive things about his character. So I think, I think it's just kind

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:21.560
of the way he decided to come forward, just had him come forward on wrong foot. And yeah. And

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:27.560
again, like for me personally, I feel like it's important for whistleblowers, especially when

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:33.800
they first come forward, stick to your direct experiences, let people know what you're speculating.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:38.920
Yeah. Or just be like, you know, I don't want to go there. Like just to cement in people's minds,

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.840
like this is their direct experience. Sorry, you're trying to like hammer through all these

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.080
questions. And I'm not going to be standing on. That's kind of, that's what we did with our Michael.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:52.600
How much from, what time do you want to go to? Okay, we'll go to 5.20. So eight minutes, guys,

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:57.000
then we got to hop off, right? Yeah. So we'll do just a question of them. But for an interview with

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.760
Michael, we try to make sure that, that every time he was speculating about something, he made

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.960
it clear, just because we want to kind of hammer down his case from his words. So let's keep,

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.400
let's get through these. We'll stay on for a little bit more. Trollmama, thank you so much.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:17.080
And I like that little beaver, beaver running through. I really appreciate you. Above Black

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.480
by Dan Sherman, I was told to read this yesterday. So I'm going to be reading that and kind of,

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.080
I'll check it and let you know what I think. I think that's my next read. Please look into

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:30.440
Jason Thans a little deeper. Yes. I'm currently trying to get in contact with Sans to speak to

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:36.120
him. I really want to talk to him. I think this was a response to the question on the guy saying

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:41.960
he was playing devil's advocate about Michael and the fake purposeful disinformation. I don't

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.800
think necessarily an example of elevated pulse was born. Yeah, suspicious about Jason Sans,

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.840
especially with how he came forward, right? Like this dude pops up on a Twitter space.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:56.040
And especially when he kind of has an idea and runs with it. So, you know, I really wish our

01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:01.720
first introduction with him was the James Fox, James Fox interview. Yeah, or like just some

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.760
other interview thoughts on Wagan. Wagan's awesome. Although he won't try to talk to him. I don't

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:14.440
think he wants to do more interviews. I've tried to contact him on massive, multiple platforms.

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.440
Sorry. You can't discredit the legitimate witnesses and whistleblowers coming down the pipe. You can

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.960
preemptively discredit the idea of a UFO whistleblower. If you're talking about Sans there,

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:26.520
I'm not shutting down Sans. I kind of need to talk to him personally before I can form a full

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.320
opinion, just because of how strange his coming out was on Twitter and so forth. There's a lot

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.480
of messiness there and a lot of murky waters. Because I know there's been a lot of discussion

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:40.760
around him and so forth. Is there any evidence at all for abductions being real? I don't know.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.000
We were talking about the Travis Walton case today and neither of us really know what to think

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.160
about that. I don't know. I try and stay a little away from abductions a little bit,

01:14:51.160 --> 01:15:02.600
because I know it's pretty murky. Why assuming NHI is a biological life form,

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.520
why would anything more powerful than us? I don't know. It's an interesting question.

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.920
Especially so many hypotheses as to why NHI are here and interacting or not interacting with us

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:19.800
is new hypothesis for one. That's a great question. It looks like anonymous is leaving

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:25.800
us gang. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry I disappointed you, dude. Without disclosing names or locations,

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:33.720
can Joey explain? Yeah, you talked about that earlier, right? Yeah. It started from a piece of

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:43.800
evidence that I was able to corroborate it with multiple public sources, data sources. At this

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:48.520
point, I've said I've tracked the helicopter. I was able to figure out the exact helicopter that

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:57.320
he was on. He flew to this location. Naturally, anyone, if you know a specific aircraft, you can

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:06.200
go and look on flight radar and see where it went at a certain time. That was my initial thing that

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:14.200
was like, holy crap. Even after that, I have, now at this point, it's just, there's no doubt whatsoever.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:20.280
My issue with Greer, yeah, I completely agree with that. He tried, what I've noticed and possibly

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.360
heard is that when he has a witness, he tries to claim the mess as his own so he can be the

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:28.440
central figure and central point of contact for everything. Trollmama, I think there's

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:33.320
plenty of people investigating. There's a lot of, there's a lot of really good channels on YouTube,

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:38.280
a lot of great people. My butthole is your butthole, Ashton. What the heck?

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.960
You didn't hear about that one? No.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:49.560
We don't need to go into it. It was his little logic witness test talking about the

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:55.320
effects effect that was on. How does that have to do with investigating? Because he thinks all

01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:00.760
explosions have the same pattern. He's like, you have a butthole, I have a butthole, but my

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:05.000
butthole's not your butthole. It was just so cringey. If you want people to take this seriously,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.560
why would technology so overheads? Yeah, I'd like to think back to the, if we were to

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:14.200
give a smartphone to the ancient Romans or a nuclear bomb to people in the Victorian era.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:20.920
Interesting question. I believe, I believe, so it looks like a lot of people are kind of commenting

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:26.200
or talking about psionics. A lot of people are kind of open to this idea, reading more,

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.440
paying attention more. That's something that I need to educate myself more on.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.280
Yeah, there was actually a couple of people that asked this elsewhere, but Michael had

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.080
alluded to last year, actually, he was going to be kind of going out and meeting the insider again

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:55.400
and seeing like a demonstration of one of these psionics, attracting, calling a craft or something

01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:00.600
like that. That kind of, that was supposed to happen last year. That fell through. Things are

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:06.040
kind of up in the air about that right now. It makes sense. I understand why I can't, I can't

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:13.320
really talk about why, but at this point, I honestly don't even think that would be even

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:18.200
something that, because I was kind of nervous about it to begin with, because like what,

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.960
you know, even if you could like videotape that or something, is it just going to be three, is it

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:25.640
just going to be three lights in the sky? Yeah. And I was kind of like, I don't know if that's

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:31.720
even going to be a good thing to do. And so there's other things that are kind of trying to be put

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:38.200
together in the background that I think are going to be a better path forward to help support

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:45.560
disclosure. I'll say that much. Let's keep going. So that might still happen. It's just the, I don't

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.960
know when. Thank you, brother. I appreciate the help. Samuel, forget that's a cool profile,

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:55.000
I've not read Trinity. I've heard a little bit of a D. Dean Johnson kind of trying to discredit

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.920
that case because I know Jacques Malay has worked on it. So I've kind of worked on that case,

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:02.680
but I need to educate myself a little more on that. And I would like to read Trinity and I

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:08.360
would like to read what a D&D Johnson says. Gary Nolan worked on a project for CIA,

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:15.080
someone we trust. I don't know. Gary Nolan seems to be a, I know nothing like a negative or anything

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:19.400
about Gary Nolan seems like an interesting do kind of pushing for disclosure. I hope his

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:26.360
head's in the right place. Yeah, I haven't heard about that either. But okay, bro, say this is

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.080
legit. If you listen to his interview, he's very reserved and is free to speak more. Yes,

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:33.640
that's why I want to talk to him because there's so much kind of drama and controversy around him

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.280
online and kind of social media spaces. But I want to talk to him and hear his story from his words.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:45.720
But he still said 20 back. Yeah, I remember it like, back in like 2016 or so, I heard the first,

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:52.760
that first dude, he said the 20 and back thing was a thing to go work at, like they're mining on

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:59.240
the moon with reptilians. That requires some extraordinary proof for that. So that is,

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:03.080
that is something a bit strange. All right, let's get through these and then we'll start

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:08.040
wrapping up eminent domain. I don't think that eminent domain will ever happen. There's also

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.680
other people we've talked to, not like whistleblowers or anything, just guys with interesting

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:17.320
backgrounds that also don't think that happened. Private aerospace have legal rights to exploit

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:22.040
technology despite potential legal technology transfers. Yeah, I think probably what David

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:26.920
brush says is pretty interesting has a lot through it that a lot of technology is specifically craft

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:31.800
is stored in private domain to avoid any sort of kind of eminent domain grab or any sort of

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:36.040
access to this craft keeps things off books and projects and so forth. You have anything to add?

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:42.840
Go ahead. Okay, sorry, I just joined. Was it Joey supposed to be anonymous? Yes,

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:47.240
he was, but this is Joey. Well, it's like, I was never like, supposedly, it's like, if you

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:52.200
do you have a Reddit account? Are you anonymous on Reddit? Yeah, me too. So like, I got into this

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:57.080
whole thing and I was just like, that just kind of maintained. And then it got to a point where

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:01.880
everyone was like, why are you anonymous? And it's like, well, I don't know. And, and, you know,

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:07.800
things were getting, I didn't know how much dangerous put myself in. And I think at this point,

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:13.000
the kind of secret stuff that I knew that I was kind of nervous about having and wanted to remain

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.120
anonymous about Michael has has talked about now. So I feel a lot more comfortable kind of at least

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:24.120
show my face. And so I decided to do that. So because I feel like the longer I kind of remain

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:27.640
completely in the shadows, like the worst that's going to get in. So it really wasn't a big deal

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:32.360
to begin with. And so that's just why. All right, let's get through these.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.840
Hey, what's up, Dutch in case that is a super interesting case. I think I did that in the

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:41.400
first ever iceberg video. Betty and Barney Hills granddaughter is a UFC fighter, Angela Hill. She

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:45.720
talked about that on JRE once. That was pretty interesting. I like that case. That's a really

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:52.200
interesting thing. Monster Hunter. Love you. For me, Travis Walton and the passing goal,

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:56.280
sorry, you guys know I can't pronounce anything. Our plenty evidence that NHI abductions are

01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.440
in a real phenomenon. The thing with me is I kind of sit me to sit down and do like a full

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:04.520
investigation for myself to reach any sort of conclusion. Like I like to sit through,

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:10.840
read multiple books, kind of way, way things and really sit down and abductions is one thing I

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:20.920
really haven't given a ton of time or focus to. What about you? Yeah, I mean, guys, I'm not like

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:27.000
I'm not Gerb Gerbs, like researching like all these different cases and stuff. Like I, I'm just

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:32.680
like a normal dude. I was like a regular, like some random Redditor guy and like a rare case,

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:37.480
just somehow I got wrapped up into it. And that's kind of what I've been focusing on. And, you know,

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:44.040
so I'd love to sometime in the future, like make a website with all my documents as a repository

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:49.800
because I have so dang many. And, you know, like in all the, the show and all the times put the

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:55.480
documents and stuff I'd lead to, but I'd love like a central database of everything there.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:59.320
Yeah, Forgotten Language is a super interesting. I first read that in the anonymous briefing

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:05.320
document for, for Congress in 2023. The Forgotten Language thing is, is sweet. There's this really

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:09.800
cool group of people, some great people that did a deep dive into Forgotten Languages. I need to

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:14.600
kind of get educated from them. Are you going back to the 1933 case I'd like to after those

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:19.160
recent release of RS33 documents? Big on the crypto terrestrial hypothesis, that's super

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:24.760
interesting too. I'd like to visit back. Trinity case is weak. You know, I need to study that as well.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:32.200
Let's, I hear you, not Joey yet, not Joey. Sorry, but who was sued a broke brother? If you've seen

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:38.360
it in my videos, I'm Gert. This is Joey. Joey's not my name on Reddit. I'm sorry, man. I'm Gert.

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:44.360
Okay, let's see. Can't wait for the Obama movie. Yeah, that's weird. The Obama movie about the hill.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:51.000
Yeah, but he's learning hill. Yeah. Harry. Hey, look at that dog. That's a very cute dog. True nuts

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.320
and bolts. I don't know. I got to study anything else. And Harry, thank you so much for, for both

01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:01.640
of this. I'd like to say as, as kind of like a, but this is a great point. If abductions are

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:05.000
other logical, if we visit another planet, we would sample the floor and on absolutely,

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:10.680
absolutely. That's why it's not something to just throw away, but needs to be kind of investigated.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:15.800
I would like to say for this live, you know, we didn't really know what to expect. We just kind

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:21.240
of wanted to talk about Michael and so forth. And you guys came with so many awesome questions.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:25.320
Like this was actually really fun. So, you know, if, if you guys would like to see,

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:29.640
to do some more lives or see some like that, I would you want to do some more? Maybe a live

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:35.480
or you know, so it's like, all right, I have a ton of respect for what you do. I, I have been so

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:41.000
apprehensive about like becoming a content creator because it's like, you, you're very vulnerable

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.600
because, you know, if you talk about or investigate a case that you like, and you put some credibility

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.840
into it, then like later it turns out to be a complete lie on the line. It's kind of like,

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:57.240
that's now attached to you. And I'm like, so afraid to do that. And, and, and like this community can

01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:02.680
can be very toxic. But like, I got to say, like your, your followers are so great. I think they

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:08.360
recognize like the amount of work you put into, you know, the cases that you, you create videos on

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:13.240
and stuff. Also, if I ever like needed hoodwinked or anything like that, and the case turns out to

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:18.040
be false, I'll come out and say it like, if I'm wrong about something, I'll totally do it. I,

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.360
I would like to cause that helps disclosure, right? Yeah, it's, it's, it's, yeah, it's, it's a trick.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:27.080
It's like a tight wire, a tight rope because, you know, and like, how much do you talk about

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:33.000
speculation and then, and get into that. And, you know, even if you say like, oh, this is speculation,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.520
people are going to be like, oh wait, he believes this. So I would like to say that, you know,

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:42.280
maybe Joe, you'll join me on some live streams, maybe he won't, but it would be kind of fun to do

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:49.400
like a one, one live a week or something like that whenever it works for anybody else. And

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:54.520
that will definitely not take place of regular videos because I'll let you guys know a little

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:59.720
secret right now before, before we wrap things up. You guys know I mentioned this a lot.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.600
Whoever's been mentioning Magic Eyes Only, the book by Ryan S. Wood,

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:11.640
focuses on Crash Retrievals and, and MJ12. Who knows this book? I'm waiting.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.160
Anyways, we'll get to Jengie Squish real fast before I talk about that. Thank you so,

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:24.360
dude, your profile picture is valid. Thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that. So this,

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:29.160
this book, Magic Eyes Only is, I fully recommend this. I'm not sponsored by the author, by the way,

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:35.160
about Crash Retrievals and MJ12. The author of this book, Ryan S. Wood, whose father Robert S. Wood,

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:40.360
who worked contracting for various defense companies and had a lot to say about MJ12, UAP and so

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:47.000
forth. I have contacted Ryan S. Wood. I know him. I've talked to him multiple times on the phone.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.280
He lives near me. I will be doing an in-person project with him, kind of doing a full dive on

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:58.840
the MJ12 soon too. And I cannot wait for that, man. That, that's going to be an awesome case

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:04.200
because the MJ12 is so complex. Like I can't have like a pea grain like myself understand

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.680
everything right away. So something with Ryan S. Wood is going to be, be really great.

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.320
Yeah. So that's really cool. We'll do more lives if you guys want. And should I keep,

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:17.800
you got an invite to author on the show? Yes. No, no, no, no, no. So, so you remember the

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:24.840
interview I had with, with, with Joey about Michael, I plan to do a documentary interview with him,

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:29.080
where he and I have a full conversation, but splice throughout the conversation is different

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:33.320
studies and anecdotes and relevant documents and kind of relevant pathways to go down,

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:39.240
not just he and I sitting for, oh man, nobody's selling nothing here, bro. Nobody's selling

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:45.720
nothing. But for, for that, for that video with Ryan S. Wood, kind of sit down with him,

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:50.680
do an in-person video recording and kind of make that into a documentary.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.400
But yeah, I'll do another one of these soon guys. And if you want, should I, do you keep

01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:00.280
live streams up? Yeah. All right. Yeah, people will watch them, right? Thank you guys so much

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:06.040
for joining. I really appreciate every single one of your views. Like we got like 140 viewers,

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:10.680
which is, which is crazy, man. I love Zambia too. I've never been, but I've only been to Morocco,

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:18.920
so. He's done a lot of traveling. I'd like to do some more, man. The lady was, you got,

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:25.160
which is not going to read it, but thank you guys so much for tuning in. I really appreciate it.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.840
I really appreciate all the good questions. Yeah, this was, this was awesome. And I appreciate

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:33.720
you hosting me here and, and, you know, having these, these few days together. It's been awesome.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.960
So we'll let the Herrera video out this as soon as possible to interview. And I'm super excited

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:40.840
to see what you guys think, because I'd like to open up some more discussion about that.

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.520
All right. Peace. All right. Thanks, gang.
