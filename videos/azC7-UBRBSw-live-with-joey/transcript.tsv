0	11680	Okay. Hello, my friends. Can everybody hear us? We're live. If everybody can hear me,
11680	19720	Towney, 3057, I appreciate that so much, man. If everybody can hear us, just say something
19720	31520	in the chat. Let me know. Uh-oh. I think we're good. Yes, we can hear. Okay. All right, cool.
31520	36640	Let me say it again. Towney, thank you, brother. I appreciate that a lot. Welcome, guys. This
36640	42400	is the first live stream I have ever done. I'm here with Joey. This is his first ever
42400	46840	public appearance, and there's 30 people here already. So, coming through loud here,
46880	53440	you're being here. Yeah, thanks for having me. This was like really crazy. So, I've been
53440	61400	here for a few days now, and Bruce Buffer to introduce you. Real quick, yesterday I made
61400	67880	Joey watch a fight night, and he was craving Bruce Buffer's sweet voice and his awesome suit,
67880	75400	but keep going. Curb is a huge UFC fan. If you guys don't know this, it was quite wild to be on
75400	83240	the couch with him watching it. But yeah, so, you know, after, what's up, Bertie? A year of,
84520	90120	hey, Xavier, I see you there. After a year of investigating Michael Herrera's case,
91880	96600	so, I'm Joey is not your name on Reddit. You know, I've been investigating his case for
97320	104520	about a year now. Finally, for the first time, took the trip to Denver to meet up with him
104520	111240	for the first time, and luckily, Curb here is in the area and was gracious enough to host me.
112440	120280	Yeah, so, we've just had a packed few days, and with this live stream, what we want to do is just
120280	125320	kind of like recap, you know, how the last few days went, some of the things we did, and of course,
125320	129800	you know, talk about our experience with Michael. Yeah, and any questions you guys have?
130760	135560	List them in the chat. We'll try and get to everything. So, the story kind of went. We have
135560	142360	been planning this trip for a couple months. Now, of course, I've said this in some comments. I don't
142360	146440	know how many people have seen this, but I've been pretty public about this. I actually got to meet
146440	152120	Michael a couple months ago. And so, I actually took him out to dinner. He's in Colorado. Y'all
152120	157320	know I'm in Colorado. So, we actually got some food. So, this wasn't my first time meeting Michael,
157320	162920	but it was Joey's. And real quick, Boxie Brown. Yes, if you see the poster in the background,
162920	167640	I stepped that made this for me, and I love it. And Joey, on my main table, we go grab, oh,
168360	174680	if you don't mind, you got UFOs. Sub last night from Michigan, Aiklin, AFB and debunking Bob was
174680	182040	our strange times. Don't forget that you can click on that. We'll get to that. Joey made me this,
182040	186680	guys. Isn't this sweet? And you know what? He didn't ask for the logo or anything to not let
186680	191720	me know anything was up. So, he made this from his own hand, which is insane. As far as getting banned
191720	197640	for UFOs, let's, Joey, can you unban this man? What is this? What is he saying? He says he got
197640	203400	banned from UFOs for mentioning the Aiklin, AFB and debunking Bob Lazar. Oh, I see. I don't know
203400	209080	anything about that. So, yeah, I'll have to look into that. Bernie wants to know what Joey thinks
209080	215800	about Nathan. We will absolutely get to that when we talk, when we kind of mention it. We'll start
215800	221720	so kind of the weekend on Friday, Joey was here and we met up with Michael for dinner.
222360	227000	That's when we were originally planning to do the first live. And right after that, we've,
228040	232120	sorry, just looking at some comments. Sorry, guys, this is my first live. So, if anything's a bit
232120	237160	sloppy, that's probably why. But Friday night, we met up with Michael for dinner. He is a business
237160	243480	owner. So, we went to one of his videos to film an interview. And right now, we have all the footage.
243800	249080	We use three cameras. Joey has some incredible gear. So, it's very professionally recorded.
250280	254680	I think we got about like four hours of footage. I think it was less than that. I think
255400	265080	scallions, maybe two and a half to three hours, I think, of footage. But yeah, we set it up in one of
265080	271560	his conference rooms and set up a few different angles. We have like a tight shot on Michael.
271560	276040	Kind of felt that was important to kind of get his reaction to, you know, questions that, you know,
276040	280760	as they were being asked to him and kind of close up. But one thing that was really cool,
280760	290920	do you have the paper? The drawing? Yeah. So, at one point, you know, when he got to the craft,
290920	296840	we were like, hey, can you just like draw this? And so, we've got this really cool kind of sequence
296840	304760	of him going through, you know, kind of his memory as he's drawing this. And so, I thought that was
304760	309240	kind of neat, you know. I want to give a quick thank you to scallions. I really appreciate that,
309240	316040	brother. And Bernie and Rob here, if you, like, not agreeing with Michael, that's something that's
316040	320200	totally all right. This case, you know, Joey and I have discussed this at length and discussed this
320200	325160	with Michael. It's a, and somebody in another Discord asked a really pertinent question, like,
325160	330520	what is, why is it so hard for a lot of people, like including myself from the get go, you know,
330520	335400	but my first video I made on Michael, I was super skeptical about it. You know, why is his story
335400	340440	so hard to believe? And I totally understand a lot of the skepticism around Michael's story. It's a,
341320	348280	it's a really weird story, especially kind of factoring in like the huge UAP and Black,
348280	354040	about Black program operators, as well as kind of being contacted by the insider and so forth. So,
354760	359400	one of the things that I wanted to do with this interview, and Joey and I had talked about this
359400	365320	a lot, is I found in other appearances from Michael in interviews and also Nathan's appearance,
365320	372760	there was still a lot of confusion around Michael's Indonesia case. If I remember correctly, from
372760	376600	Nathan's appearance, there was a lot of confusion for people who don't know these things.
377000	384360	It was Michael's team leader at one point, and he was on the same deployment to Indonesia,
384360	390280	and he recently was interviewed by Patrick on VETA, and he doesn't believe Michael. He thinks
390280	397320	Michael's lying, and he provided, you know, his testimony, as well as a photograph that he
398040	403960	claims shows Michael, you know, kind of prepping to go into Indonesia with him.
404760	410120	And so, that was something we brought up to Michael as well. There's like a camouflage
410120	416200	match that, you know, was brought up. And the fact of the matter is, I saw some discussion
416200	421640	about this. Nathan was Michael's mission operation, like in the field team leader,
421640	427080	that, you know, a question. I see some people saying like, you know, is he a plankman?
427080	431400	I think Nathan's just a team leader that doesn't like Michael at all. Well, no one really,
431480	435560	honestly, like no one liked Michael in the platoon. The thing that was so crazy for me,
436680	440680	like meeting Michael for the first time in person, I mean, obviously, like over the past year, I've
440680	453480	gotten to know him. It was just like a profile picture. Like, I've gotten to know Michael over
453480	460440	the past year, but like meeting him in person, it just struck me that he is not at all the person
461080	467960	that Nathan describes from 2009. I've also had the opportunity to speak with a few other
469240	475640	people from Michael's platoon who knew him back then. And he's just a totally different person
475640	481800	now. You know, he's like a completely remade person. And there's some, you know, he had some
481800	487000	personal struggles after he got out of Marines that you can listen to his total disclosure
487560	491480	interview. And he kind of goes into that. And it just, it just really makes a lot of sense.
491480	496520	So he kind of hit rock bottom and just had this, you know, someone off in his head to like totally
496520	504280	change his, his life. And I just, I just had like a totally positive experience. Like, as far as his
504280	513480	character and his mannerisms and, you know, just like going out to eat and being polite, so polite
513560	518600	to the, to the staff and just attentive, you know, in conversation and stuff like that.
519800	523560	So that was kind of one of my big takeaways from, from meeting him in person.
523560	531800	And so with the, with the, the Nathan's testimony, I found a lot of factual inaccuracies just from
531800	537640	the time that interview was released with Nathan. A both vetted and Nathan were kind of pressing
537640	542200	that this mission happened that night. It was like some secret night mission that didn't,
542200	546200	that wasn't anything Michael had ever said. He'd always said this was a daytime mission.
546760	551160	They said it, similar to the Arrow historical report this had to do with extraterrestrials
551160	558760	and aliens. It did not. I had a couple other issues. But just like, I agree with some of the
558760	564040	cases, there's some of the claims that Nathan was a little dismissed. Clearly does not like Michael
564040	568040	kind of talking about how Michael would spend hours in the gym and just was a weirdo would
568040	571880	take walks by himself. So for this interview, we really wanted to nail down
573800	578040	a lot. Jim, Jim, thank you so much. I will get to your question in one second.
578040	584840	We really wanted to nail down kind of a lot of the details of kind of Michael's story,
584840	589000	including because one of Nathan's strongest claims is that he was on mission with Michael.
589000	595160	And there's no way Michael could have gone on this UFO mission. So you'll see this in our
595160	600040	interview, but Michael has stated before he was stationed on the USS Denver in Chow, preparing
600040	604920	officer meals and so forth. And we really tried to nail down the time period that this volunteer
604920	608680	mission where he ended up observing the UFO, he says he observed the UFO happened during one of
608680	613160	his shifts in kind of the Chow Hall. This approach recruited us just to volunteer for this mission.
613160	618280	This wasn't with his normal kind of team leader and fire team. This was a put together rag tag
618280	623240	kind of group of volunteers, especially. And was kind of a off the cuff mission to the point where,
623240	628440	remember, Mike was an M249 saw gunner. And here on this mission, he claims he was handed an M16A4
628440	633560	200 Norwegian Kronath. I know that. Thank you for that. I really appreciate that. Also,
633560	637240	Norway is one of my favorite countries on the earth. I was just in Oslo last September.
637240	642920	But so just kind of ironing out some of those details. And before I continue, you have anything
642920	649880	to add? I think one of the other inconsistencies was like, I think it was stated that like they
649880	655640	saw the UFO from the LZM, but they didn't see anything until they got to the top of the hill.
657320	662440	But yeah, the other questions, I mean, really addressing Nathan's stuff was kind of just a
662440	669480	small part of the interview. A lot of it was focused on things that I noticed like small
669480	677800	details or kind of gaps in time of his testimony where he might have skipped from one thing and
677880	681480	kind of like went to the next thing. And there, you know, maybe there was like a half hour in
681480	687880	between that kind of is fuzzy, you know, that he has never talked about. And so I tried to
687880	696040	identify some of those areas that would help kind of add context to the situation. And we also
696040	701480	talked about the inside. Yes. One of the things I'm really glad Michael talked about in this
701480	707240	interview because he's only kind of mentioned it kind of halfway or just in passing, but he
707240	711800	actually told us the story and did it live. We'll have it in the interview kind of how
711800	716040	he came in contact with the insider because he's just said before, oh, this insider contacted him.
716600	723960	If we remember to the NPC 2023, that was June 12. June 9th or 10th is when the Daily Mail
723960	730200	article came out. That was about Herrera's story. Pre Greer's NPC 2023, there was actually a three
730200	736520	day kind of closed private event. And that's where Michael first gave his testimony in a
736520	743000	private setting. And it was here that the insider was at this event. And once Michael gave his
743000	748280	testimony, Michael says that the insider kind of talked to Greer said, I know what this is,
748280	752680	let me try and connect with Michael. And after a little bit of phone tag with Greer and this insider,
754200	759960	they finally connected and this insider invited him out to this location. That is so infamous
759960	767560	now, kind of the most infamous part of Michael's story. Yeah. And for me, so you guys have to
767560	772200	understand when this was all unfolding, I was in direct contact with Michael.
778600	782920	First of all, he told me this insider wanted to meet him. I was like super skeptical.
783640	790280	It sounded like what are the chances you have like a UFO witness, and all of a sudden,
790280	796360	someone in the black program is going to wants to meet them. So I was super skeptical, but
798040	802760	I had a phone call with him the day before the meeting. That phone call has since been,
802760	808760	we've published that on the video that you and I did together a few months back. I kind of hear
808840	815080	a clip of that video, but in it you can see like I was given certain details about the location and
816600	821960	timing of that meeting. And ultimately,
824760	833800	I was able to obtain some evidence that proved Michael was on a specific helicopter.
834360	840120	And so I was able to track that helicopter without Michael's knowledge. And I could see exactly where
840120	845640	that helicopter went that day. I didn't tell Michael about this, you know, right at the start.
845640	850760	You know, once he got back, I spoke with him and said, you know, I started asking him some questions
850760	856600	and, you know, asked him like what time does he remember them taking off stuff like that. And
856600	865160	just like everything was lining up. I also, well, so one thing is at this point, you're
865160	872280	fully kind of read in on all of that evidence. Yeah. So, A, thank you so much. That's a cool name.
872280	879560	And I appreciate you so much. That's so kind of you. But B, the kind of a, yeah, let me,
879560	886040	let's get to this to kind of, but so a lot of this evidence about that initial meeting was
886840	893240	a helicopter kind of a visit to this location. Joey was able to track down with multiple pieces
893240	899880	of self-confirming data from kind of publicly available flight records. And I like, I don't
899880	903320	know how much I want to say about it. So you tell me some of the pieces that help that. Yeah. I mean,
904920	910760	the reason why it might have to be vague about like the main piece of evidence I use is like
911000	918840	the nature in which it was obtained could kind of compromise certain things. So,
919720	925160	and it's been really frustrating for me, you know, at the time, you know, I eventually revealed to
925160	933960	Michael like, hey, I tracked the helicopter and he was like, holy crap. And, you know, at the time,
933960	939320	I felt it was important to reach out to certain people, you know, certain journalists,
940040	948440	certain like podcasters, things like that. And just explains him to them that like, look, Michael's
948440	953640	not lying about this insider. Like this meeting happened, you know, like, I can't prove the
953640	960280	insider is who he is. But I know he went to this location that's like, I know where he went.
960920	966440	Herb knows exactly where he went. And it's, it's like a very interesting location. Yeah,
966920	972840	that's what makes things so weird because there's still a lot of like people and still a lot of
972840	976600	valid thoughts about, you know, is this guy disinformation? Like I totally understand that
976600	981720	point of view. It's totally, you know, that's kind of where my mind drifted initially to
983480	989960	puzzle the helicopter. But Joey also, what's the question? The helicopter equals insider.
990920	998120	Okay. Can you name the location, Bernie, Rob? I cannot. That's not my, that's not my location.
998120	1005400	So, well, let me, let me address this question here. So I'm not, you're basically kind of saying,
1005400	1013960	like, am I taking evidence of a helicopter to mean that I know the insider's real? No, that's not,
1014040	1021480	that's not it. It's so initially it was the nature in which he took him to this location
1022440	1031640	just said to me that this guy at the very least has to be some sort of high level person to be
1031640	1042200	able to take him where he took him in the nature in which he did that. But now I have, I mean, we have
1042200	1052440	like third party corroboration of this insider from multiple very trusted people. Yeah, it kind
1052440	1057240	of overlines that. If you guys watched my, my witnesses one video with the story of, and that's
1057240	1061320	what I'm talking about, Doug Way. And I linked that YouTube video that's kind of talking about Area
1061320	1068680	51, stuff being moved to Doug Way or Weiner. Let me get to that in one second. But thank you so much.
1068760	1074680	But in that documentary I linked it shows like random citizens pulling up to Doug Way, right,
1074680	1078360	which is this location is not Doug Way, but random citizens being pulled up to Doug Way,
1078360	1082360	getting approached by men at arms, being held at gunpoint, being approached by Apache helicopters.
1082920	1087320	If this was just some random dude taking Michael to this location, they would have been pulled
1087320	1094200	up on and probably detained because it is a, it's not a Starbucks, right? Like he didn't get
1094920	1099480	introduced to Starbucks or something like that. Real fast, before we keep talking about that,
1099480	1104440	Ort Weiner, no, I have not heard back from TV. I will probably not be talking to him again unless
1104440	1111320	he becomes a, but yeah, I'll probably just let him, I don't, I don't really want to infringe on his
1111320	1120120	privacy anymore. But keep going. Yeah, so when I started reaching out to these different, you
1120120	1128520	know, journalists and podcasters who, you know, and I wanted, I just wanted just to say like,
1129320	1134360	Michael's not lying about this one thing, because I felt like it would just elevate,
1134360	1139560	you know, kind of the stand that like the base level of trust, instead of just kind of, you know,
1141960	1147000	just, you know, interviewing him or talking to him without having that information. Now,
1147080	1154200	unfortunately, I had to censor kind of key parts of that evidence. When I was doing these,
1154200	1159800	these calls with these people, most of them, there's a couple, I did share the full evidence,
1159800	1167160	and they were able to verify it and know the location. Verb here now, at this point, Michael
1167160	1173800	has, you know, given him the trust to be kind of like fully read in on that. So I'm like, I'm,
1174040	1179720	I just have such a relief and weight off my shoulders to finally have like someone else,
1180280	1186680	other than me, just being like, yeah, guys, trust me, who has seen the full picture of,
1186680	1194120	of like evidence of this meeting, who can kind of, you know, talk about it and be like, yeah,
1194120	1202440	I'm not an idiot. And like, do you think the insider has proof that Michael is saying the
1202440	1207000	truth or the insider just trusts Michael's story? Michael has said that the reason he
1207000	1211000	was taken to this location is because the insider told him he would be shown proof to corroborate
1211000	1220360	his story. And I think that's probably like a pretty fair guess, guess to say that, you know,
1220920	1225160	some elements of Michael's story he felt were corroborated. Bertie, I do want to tell you this,
1225160	1230920	this insider, I do not think it's in Taylor. Yeah, so no, just to, just if I could address this
1230920	1240680	question to you, I think 100% the insider knows Michael's telling the truth. Like, like, if the
1240680	1247000	insider is who he says he is, like, just logically, it doesn't make sense if he wouldn't, if he didn't
1247000	1255080	believe him. And the whole thing is like, the insider allegedly, you know, is familiar with
1255080	1261800	these types of operations. And that was, you know, one of the reasons why he wanted to,
1263320	1266920	you know, build a relationship with Michael. And actually, this was one of the questions I had
1266920	1275160	during the interview with Michael was like, why did he need or want you to kind of have this
1275160	1279640	relationship and stuff. And so Michael kind of goes into that. And it makes a lot of sense,
1279720	1285880	in my opinion, you know, kind of why they have this sort of mutual relationship and
1286840	1291800	what the insider is getting out of it from Michael. And I've struggled and grappled with this,
1291800	1295720	just Michael's whole story so much. Because if you guys remember the first video I ever did,
1296280	1301240	a couple months ago, I straight up still told I was extremely skeptical of Michael and didn't,
1301240	1305240	didn't, kind of didn't believe him over time. And especially talking to Michael, some of the,
1305800	1310440	some of the confirming elements of just meeting the insider and so forth is so strange to me.
1311000	1315640	I, I don't know kind of what the, the future of this entails or really the,
1315640	1321080	the consequence this holds to Michael or even what he saw. I still don't know that I really
1321080	1327080	would like to know, but it's such a weird story. And I think in this, this interview, which I saw
1327080	1330600	somebody asking, was it going to be out? I'm trying to add it all right now. So I will get it out this
1330680	1337960	week. But I, I just feel like this week, I know, but the people want to see it, right? I want to
1337960	1342520	get this video. I'm so excited. But it's just, it's such an interesting story. And I really do
1342520	1346760	understand it. So I want to touch back to why some people don't believe the Michael story, but
1346760	1353000	the craft, Bernie, the craft he saw was a pretty, was octagonal, kind of octagonal shape. Yeah,
1353000	1359160	throw that up there. I mean, this is just a sketch, but yeah, there's, there's some better
1359160	1365480	drawings and kind of renderings of, of the craft that he described. Oh, we also, sorry,
1365480	1370760	I don't want to track. I was just going to say, Oh, okay. How much do you trust Steven Greer?
1370760	1376520	That is a loaded question. How much do I trust Steven Greer right now? Probably a two. How much
1376520	1381640	do I trust Steven Greer's database and just people who have contacted him? Because most of the
1381640	1388200	witnesses that I found and so forth just reached out to Greer, not contacted him. High confidence in
1389160	1395080	a lot of those people. But Greer, I've made it well known. You know, maybe I haven't seen it for
1395080	1400520	myself. So I don't know if the CE five is, is legit or anything like that. I don't know. I,
1400520	1406280	that's weird. That's kind of strange to me. But I don't think, I think, I think Greer's got a huge
1406280	1411000	ego. I think he just kind of wants to possess his own witnesses. For example, Michael talk,
1411000	1415400	I think this was on the total disclosure podcast. But of course, his story came out through Greer.
1415400	1419800	He kind of maybe would have gone through different routes if he knew now, but he specifically
1419800	1424600	mentioned Greer either purposefully or mis-purposefully lying about his case. When he's had the men
1424600	1430040	of black operators, when they were pulling guns on them, Greer had said overdramatized the story
1430040	1434440	saying that the men made the Marines kind of get on their knees, turn around, guns pointing back to
1434440	1440760	their head, like almost a movie level of kind of drama. And so this happens with Michael and who
1440760	1445080	knows what other people he's talked about. It just kind of stretches the story, but just stretches
1445160	1452760	things a little bit. I think, I think if Greer eased back on the ego a bit and trying to
1452760	1457400	grift people for thousands of dollars for CE5 stuff, he'd be taken home more seriously.
1457400	1463160	But he's just an enigma to me, man. I don't know, because if you guys have read the 2001 disclosure
1463160	1467400	project briefing document, that's what, I think that is really a document, runs it back. It's
1467400	1472840	fantastic. And so that was in 2001 and 97. Where did he go wrong? That now he's trying to command
1472840	1478600	Lordship or people who contact him? I don't know. And also, like if you go through the,
1479240	1483880	if you go through the DPI archive, some of those documents he's uploaded, and I kind of felt guilty
1483880	1488280	about pulling through some of these, say they're protected by Dr. Client Privileges. Why is he posting
1488280	1493320	this stuff? It's immoral. It's absolutely immoral that he's doing that. And sometimes I feel bad
1493320	1499400	looking through that stuff, but I don't know, man. I don't like it. Interesting to know if Michael
1499400	1505720	has talked about masonry or if you have any thoughts on that. Michael was wearing a masonic pin
1505720	1509800	and he outs talked to us because of course that's so interesting. He just kind of told us that he
1509800	1514680	joined masonry because he kind of liked the kind of wealth oriented mindset and joining the group
1514680	1519240	of people and so forth. So for him, he wasn't a native mason like family wise. I don't even know
1519240	1525720	how joining masonry works, but he just joined pretty young, I think at 18. At 18? Yeah. Yeah.
1525720	1533480	But yeah, I mean, he appreciates a lot of the history behind it. And he's talked about,
1534200	1538280	he's kind of addressed the conspiracy theories and stuff like that and
1539640	1544360	on kind of other interviews and whatnot. But yeah, I mean, like the wealth aspect,
1545400	1551320	like we toured his business and it's an incredibly complex organization,
1551720	1557800	yeah, incredibly impressive. It's an eight figure business just by looking at it.
1557800	1564520	It's about no other panel. Oh, yeah, I don't remember what that was. He addressed that on the
1564520	1568280	total disclosure. Okay, I need to check it out. I checked where the pity was wearing. Yeah.
1569480	1575240	But we also talked about Kirkpatrick. Oh, yes. Okay. Yeah, guys, this is gonna be
1575880	1580600	really great too. I live in a birdie. If you're in Kentucky, my pops lives in Pendleton. I'm
1580600	1587240	out there all the time. I love Pendleton. So I'll get to this in one second, but
1587800	1593560	Arrow. So yeah, Michael did testify to Arrow and in the interview, he talks at length about that.
1593560	1598040	He testified directly to Kirkpatrick and we'll just give a little details. He, this
1599000	1608040	Jimmie, is that okay? Can you thank you? And I really appreciate that. The last time,
1608040	1614280	I'm splitting that one with you, man. I don't want anything. I really appreciate that. Thank you
1614280	1619880	so much, Jimmie. I really appreciate that. That is so kind of you. Seriously, from the bottom of
1619880	1625400	my heart. But Arrow, so he testified directly to Arrow. There were a couple people in the room.
1626040	1630680	Michael said that Dr. Kirkpatrick sat lean back with his legs crossed the whole time,
1630680	1636280	asked three questions about Indonesia, three questions because he testified in April of 2023.
1636280	1643560	So before the NPC 2023 with Greer, he said, Kirkpatrick asked three times the same question.
1643560	1648120	He said three questions, but they were the same question. He didn't type anything down. He just
1648120	1653240	had some handwritten notes. After that, Kirkpatrick and Arrow told him they would be following up
1653240	1657640	and they never did. He never heard from them again. And he was also surprised and pretty
1658680	1662760	angered when he saw historical report volume one and saw that it was completely
1663720	1669320	kind of falsifying his testimony to Arrow. You're supposed to like, as a content creator,
1669320	1675560	you got to like leave teases. You spoiled it. But still, you got to stop. I don't want to.
1676360	1681000	See, that's what I like about you. You're not like leaning into all the like kind of work.
1681000	1686760	No, I'm not going to do trailers. No, it's awesome. He thought Kirkpatrick was a total jerk.
1687960	1692200	So yeah, the question was like, who were the operators? That was like the one thing that he
1692920	1696040	was focused in on. He didn't ask anything else.
1699160	1704920	This, for what, yes, I've tried to find that person. That's in the emails. Also,
1704920	1709640	tried to talk to John Stuart. I've heard some kind of positive and negative things on that
1709640	1713240	encounter. So I really am trying to get to the bottom of it, as well as the strange connection
1713240	1718760	to the 1974 Chihuahua Mexico crash retrieval case. I want to cover it. That occurred in
1718760	1725960	Cuyome, Mexico in 1974. Supposedly a crash, UAP, a disk collided with a small Cessna airplane.
1725960	1731320	Mexican authorities retrieved the craft. A United States kind of insurgency team killed those people
1731320	1735240	and took the craft. So that's all I know about that. I know data, anything to back that up now,
1735240	1740520	but I will cover that case. Bernie, yes, if you've seen the disclosure project and you've seen
1740520	1745880	witness A or B, I can't remember which, I'm trying to find that person. They said he was Boeing
1745880	1751160	and locking Skogwork. So I'm trying to track down who that person is. I know his name because it's
1751160	1755880	actually listed, not redacted in the, in the career files, which is crazy because if you read
1755880	1761480	the disclosure project, it says AH, that's the name, AH, but in the career witness list, his name
1761480	1767720	is unredacted. So I won't hide that. If somebody beats me to finding him, fair play. But yeah,
1767720	1770360	I'm trying to track down that guy. I have a friend of a friend whose father's management
1770360	1775160	Skogwork's in the 2000s. Bernie, Rob, if you want to talk about UAP, tell him to contact me, please.
1775160	1778520	Yeah, it's been, it's been so cool to just kind of shadow over
1779080	1785800	Gerb these past few days. I mean, I think within the span of like a few days, like you've made
1785800	1792280	like two new contacts, have had conversations with, you know, some, some witnesses.
1793640	1800520	Like it's incredible. Like the hustle behind here, it's just, it's, it's really cool to see.
1800520	1804760	Yeah. So I might mention this in another video, but if you guys are watching, I would like to
1804840	1810840	tell you about something that I found. Another one of Gerr's witnesses I made contact with,
1810840	1815640	this guy's actually a PhD professor at a university, completely vetted his credentials,
1816520	1820840	not a first-hand encounter, second-hand encounter. But let me tell you about the second-hand
1820840	1824680	encounter. I have no more data on it than just speaking to this gentleman the other day.
1824680	1827880	He's actually a good point of contact. He's actually in Colorado, so I'd like to talk to him
1827880	1833800	more. But when he was in university for his PhD, are we going to see Michael in documentaries or
1833880	1838360	hearings? We'll get to that right after this story. While doing, while getting his PhD,
1838360	1845800	one of his professors was an army electrical engineer. And this is Jim, Jim, Jim there.
1846840	1856040	Jim. Wow. Thank you. You were, I'm just wondering, all right. You like $100, $100 that note to Joey.
1856040	1861480	Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Jim. That's incredible. Thank you so much. But so this guy has a second
1861480	1867640	hand encounter, right? His professor in university, getting his PhD, used to be in the army core of
1867640	1871960	electrical engineers. He used to be an electrical engineer in army engineering. So he told me back
1871960	1876680	in the 50s, early 50s, I think this might be 53 around the time of Kingman. Hey, I'll get to that
1876680	1881400	in one second. His professor, while a little liquored up at a party one night, said that one
1881400	1885560	night in the early 50s, in the middle of the night, he was woken up from his bunk. From his bunk,
1885560	1890520	he was placed in a bust, driven hours to an airstrip, but in a plate with no windows. If you
1890520	1894520	remember so far, this sounds oddly similar to Arthur Stansel in the Kingman crash. He's put in
1894520	1899080	this plane, is flown to a place in the middle of the desert, brought into a building in the middle
1899080	1904120	of the desert where a bunch of strange objects were in like an industrial laboratory. I told
1904120	1908680	it, figure out how they work. A couple years later, he asked the same professor, the professor
1908680	1914280	denied that and said, no, it was Russian objects. So that's a really interesting story. That's the
1914280	1918600	best one I'm talking about. Well, yeah, because he asked, he said, what were they? And he said,
1918680	1922760	they're not ours. Yeah, he said, they're not ours. Quote, they're not ours. Yeah. And then later on,
1922760	1928600	he's like, Oh, I didn't mean any Chai or anything when it was Russian. Yeah. So, but he didn't
1928600	1933880	believe that. No, you don't believe that because why would a PhD in electrical engineering know
1933880	1939720	that? So that's an interesting story. Three, three D monster. No, sir, I actually have my degree in
1939720	1947880	mechanical engineering. Oh, okay. Sorry about that, guys. Still working on this. In documentaries
1947880	1954760	or hearings, hearings, I would hope so. I know he's, he's willing to kind of testify of approach
1955320	1959800	documentaries. I'm not quite sure he's, he's kind of like, he doesn't want to do too many
1959800	1964840	media appearances. One of the reasons he did this interview is just because like, you know,
1964840	1968760	we've developed a relationship with Michael over the months, but do you have any other insights?
1969800	1975800	I mean, there's some stuff that I'm vaguely aware of, but I don't, I don't think it's like public yet.
1977960	1986040	But, you know, one thing I want to just kind of acknowledge as well. I spoke to Ross Colthart,
1986040	1993240	like last year, very early on, he was actually one of the first people I approached to kind of
1993240	2002840	share the evidence that I had. And he finally, you know, he did a Reddit AMA a few months ago,
2003480	2010920	and acknowledge that he's investigating Michael Herrera's case. And I've known this the whole
2010920	2020120	time. And he also recently in one of his reality check segments, you know, expressed that he finds
2020120	2027880	what he says he likes Michael, and he finds what he says credible. So I just want to like,
2028680	2036040	put that out there, you know, in case you guys missed it. This is a very interesting case. And
2038120	2044520	I mean, at this point, like, there are a lot of things that I know Michael is 100% telling the
2044520	2050920	truth about. And, you know, of course, there's a lot of things that I don't have the evidence for.
2050920	2057640	Yeah, plenty. Yeah, like, people call real fast broke Johnny like, where can I find this
2057640	2062120	custodian filing? Thank you so much. Love you, man. A lot of people call have called Joey Michael's
2062120	2067480	publicist. But, you know, you don't you do not claim to have all the all the information with
2067480	2073080	Michael, do you? No, and it's like, you know, there's a lot of times like he in the past,
2073080	2077240	like he's done interviews. Like, I didn't even know he was doing an interview. And like,
2077240	2084440	I just see it just like all you guys, you know. But, you know, I did reach out to,
2084440	2093480	like I said, Ross, and Richard Dolan, and, you know, like Chris Leto yourself. Yeah,
2093480	2098520	you know, I reach out to you, Steven Deener, because, you know, I knew that they were interested
2098520	2102040	in talking to Michael. And I was like, Hey, can I just like, you mind if I can talk to them
2102040	2106280	ahead of time? And Michael put me in touch with them sometimes or sometimes I'd reach out directly.
2106920	2110120	And I just be like, look, I'd have a private video call with them and just be like, look,
2110120	2114760	I just want to share this evidence that I have before you talk to Michael so you can see. But
2114760	2119560	I'm not like at all part of like, court meeting, his appearances or anything like that. So,
2120760	2126200	yeah, people, for a long time, people thought I was Michael, because like I was anonymous.
2126200	2130840	Yeah, but now everybody knows you Joey, this dude's a giant man. He's like, six, five,
2130840	2134600	six, four, he dwarfs me. He dwarfs Michael. But I'm not like built like you. You're,
2134600	2139480	you're like Jack. Yes, this is, this is Joey right here. Chris Leto.
2141240	2145880	I think he's gotten such things. Chris Leto is a wonderful man, a good pilot, a fantastic channel.
2146520	2152200	There was of course a period of time where, you know, the don't die, don't die. He's all dude,
2152200	2158600	he's a giant. But there was just a period of time. Do you think NASA and Space Force knows?
2158600	2164600	Space Force, I'm not quite sure. NASA, NASA's had a weird relationship with, with UAP. If you,
2164600	2171640	if you remember my last video, that kind of NASA back in the 60s and 70s would always claim they
2171640	2178840	had no kind of interest in studying UAP. But there was a good period of time in 70s, specifically
2178840	2184120	78 where there were many internal memos with NASA discussing UAP. So I'm not sure to their
2184120	2189080	extent, like if NASA is involved in black programs and reverse engineering, but NASA is very,
2189080	2193480	very interesting. Thoughts on Raytheon building UFOs and Antarctica. I've heard nothing about this,
2193480	2199080	Polaris. If you have anything to share, email me at gmail.com. I'd love to see what you say.
2199080	2203400	So we'll try to get out of these questions. Get to Patrick's. Okay. Is this, do you think Nathan
2203400	2211720	was put? No, no. He so yeah. So I got in touch with Nathan pretty early on. And he was extremely
2211720	2216280	gracious with his time, you know, going back and forth with me, you know, just kind of texting and
2216280	2224920	chatting. And, you know, quickly found out he is exactly what he says he is. I do not at all think
2224920	2231480	he's like a paid disinformation agent or anything like that. What I kind of got the vibe was he just
2231480	2236360	never liked Michael. And I got that vibe from every political member I spoke to, because
2236360	2242920	you have to understand Michael was not part of their group through boot camp, you know, he was
2242920	2249880	in a different company. He went UA, which is unauthorized absence from his original company.
2249880	2257000	He's upfront about that from his very first, you know, coming forward. Yeah. So, you know,
2257000	2261080	it was nothing he ever was hiding behind. And, you know, people accused him of like trying to hide that.
2261720	2269000	But so he got transferred to Nathan's company prior to that deployment to Indonesia.
2269000	2274360	And so all of those guys looked at him and they just think he's like a loser because, you know,
2274360	2279240	they find out he went UA and, you know, they were bullying him and he just kind of leaned
2279240	2284680	into it and kind of screwed with them back. And so none of them liked it. So that's what I recognize
2284680	2290280	for Nathan. And I mean, if you can put yourself in Nathan's shoes and, you know, the guy that you
2290280	2297880	remember being strange is coming forward with like his really extraordinary claims. And he was his
2297880	2306040	team leader, you know, at, you know, during that deployment. But, you know, I, so like, I don't
2306040	2314200	have a military background. So like, I, the, you know, if Michael has said from, from his first,
2314200	2320840	you know, testimony that the mission he was on was a volunteer pick of people from different
2320840	2325400	squads. And I think he even said different platoons because there are multiple platoons on the ship.
2326040	2333080	And so from day one, his testimony has always been that he did not deploy with his assigned
2333640	2341240	squad. So Nathan was never a part of Michael's testimony. And it's just kind of silly that like
2341720	2347880	why would Michael, like if Michael was making this up, why would he make up a
2348840	2354760	fake mission about a UFO? But then after, you know, 14 years of thinking about it and saying,
2354760	2361400	I'm going to come forward, also decide to lie about the real mission he did with Nathan. That part
2361400	2366440	has always bothered me. It just makes no sense. Because literally the only thing that puts Nathan's
2366440	2371640	testimony against Michael is Michael's denial of him going on a mission with him. So he could have
2371640	2376680	easily just said, yeah, I did two missions. I did one with a volunteer group that, you know,
2378600	2386760	saw the UAP. And then I did another regular mission with my team leader. And we didn't see
2386760	2393000	anything on that one. So I'm not sure if there was a second part to that question. We'll explore
2393080	2398360	through a couple of these. We'll be Milo. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. If you've got
2398360	2403240	any questions, I will get to them right away. Sorry, we're trying to scroll through these questions.
2403240	2407800	And I see you anonymous. What do you mean? Let us let us know what you think. Why are you staying
2407800	2411080	in a trust we grow with million claims? No evidence, because I understand how you feel.
2411640	2415560	Like here, how you think, why is that that some things are made not made public yet? I like to
2415560	2419880	think back to David Rush saying a program for reverse engineering and so forth, feudalistic
2419880	2426040	dominance. And just I still think that over time, there's a lot more interesting parallels to be
2426040	2430280	drawn to somewhat of a hidden cold war for decades between adversaries and so forth,
2430280	2434200	kind of a race to understand this technology thoughts on Kirk Patrick's new position.
2435640	2442600	DOE influence all the time. I do not like Kirk Patrick at all. And I think his interview with
2442600	2448360	Green Street was pretty funny how part two was just kind of changed to be solely discussing the
2448360	2452840	2018 Skinwalker Braving. So with the Raytheon stuff, I don't know. I don't know what I think
2452840	2457000	about Eric Hecker. Some of his claims, I know I'm talking about Michael here and discussing
2457000	2461560	how I find his claims interesting. The neutrino detector, that's a little bit hard to believe
2461560	2468200	that the neutrino detector is like a kind of like a weather weapon. I need I need to do more
2468200	2473640	study than to like have a and just to touch on the why things aren't public yet. I mean,
2474440	2480760	the group that Michael is working with, with this insider, their pro disclosure,
2480760	2486040	like this was the whole reason they connected with Michael. They have things going on that
2486040	2491800	they're trying to, you know, I think if you guys back out and kind of look at disclosure as a whole,
2491800	2497320	like there's multiple groups of people trying to push disclosure forward from different angles.
2497320	2503080	You know, you've got the legislation side of things. You have kind of, you know,
2503800	2508680	intelligence community insiders who weren't read into the program, but kind of have an idea that
2508680	2512360	there's something going on and they're kind of pushing things forward to try to get things.
2512360	2519320	And you have people in the program who just can't become public about it because they have,
2519320	2526040	you know, families and they're at risk. And I think what we're hearing not just from Michael,
2526040	2533000	but from other sources is that there needs to be more kind of whistleblower protection.
2533000	2539720	Yeah. Something I experienced outright with TB in it, this is kind of aligns with the whistleblower
2539720	2544040	protection is part of the reason I don't think he wanted to come forward with career is, you know,
2544040	2548120	having his name public, he will still lose his pension completely. You guys got a family to
2548120	2552200	provide for and so forth, but his pension will be completely gone, never get another job in
2552200	2557320	government. So more whistleblower protection seem to be in place and kind of liquid how
2557320	2562920	some whistleblowers have been treated a little bit. Do you think the next aero boss,
2562920	2567240	do you think the next aero boss will be different? Probably not. I think aero is rotten from the
2567240	2572120	inside out then, but I'd love to be proven wrong. I think there needs to be a large internal
2572120	2577080	investigation into aero. Let's see what, thank you so much Broke Johnny Live. That's your second
2577080	2581960	cash donation. I really appreciate you. We do not need any person to film these in 4K.
2581960	2586600	Yeah, footage is a weird one to me because as we saw on vetted yesterday, there was that dude at
2586600	2592440	Moopon who presented that crash retrieval photo. And it's just like, footage is a little,
2592440	2597560	is really hard to kind of authenticate or completely disprove. And at this point for me,
2597560	2602040	like in my private research, just studying footage is not enough. That's why I try and
2602040	2606200	talk to all these people. I really just want to speak to people and so forth.
2606200	2611960	I'm not, thank you for your channel. Thank you so much first, last, I appreciate you.
2611960	2617880	I want to talk to Anonymous. Yeah, I definitely understand that point of view because there's
2617880	2623000	a lot of trust me bro stuff with people like Jeremy Corbell. I think with this evidence where
2623000	2627960	Michael was taken, I think that Joey can't share it because Michael- Well, it would just
2627960	2634920	compromise the insider. Totally compromise. But like, I totally understand the sentiment and
2635480	2641560	like, I just, I had a decision. Do I just not say anything publicly, even though I know it's true?
2642600	2648840	Or what I came up with was a compromise. I said, well, let me reach out to different people who,
2649400	2656760	you know, the community mostly trusts, you know, different kind of people in the community,
2657400	2662040	podcasters, journalists and things like that and share that evidence with them. And then they can,
2662040	2668200	you know, if they think I'm full of baloney, they can call me out on it and shut me down, you know.
2668760	2676920	What I didn't expect was a lot of them kind of wanted to kind of continue their investigation
2676920	2684200	privately and not just like come forward and stuff like that. But at the end of the day,
2684200	2692360	I totally respect and understand the majority of you guys feeling like, you know, this,
2693080	2696600	you just kind of want to set this aside because that evidence isn't-
2696600	2698920	That's a good question to touch on too. Very good question.
2698920	2706840	Why would it compromise the insider? Because this, you know, these guys have kind of a regular job
2706840	2711720	as well, right? They're like, it's not just like the Black program stuff that they do,
2711720	2717240	they have kind of a regular job that they do. And so the location would kind of indicate
2718520	2727080	the people that work there, essentially, you know. So that's why. Well, there's another reason.
2727080	2732200	So you're working. It's having positive vibes. Thank you, brother. Not to trust me, bro.
2732760	2738680	Anon, I totally understand your sentiment, man. Like, I would love for Michael to talk about this.
2738680	2744280	I'd love for this thing insider to be public, but unfortunately, I don't get to call the shots
2744280	2751960	there. I'm just trying to kind of study this case as best as I can. But, you know, I completely
2751960	2757160	understand why it's frustrating, especially in a subject where a lot of people make claims
2757160	2762520	and don't really touch on it. Aztec. Aztec's a really good case I really want to cover.
2763240	2769400	So if you guys remember to, if you guys remember when I did my Wilson Davis
2769400	2774280	memo, James, the guy who actually beat the Wilson Davis memo, I become friends with him. He's a
2774280	2780360	wonderful man, a great person, and he is strongly of the mind that Aztec is a hoax. So I really want
2780360	2785480	to speak to him and why he does that. Majed Brazil, I really want to cover that too. MacMade
2785480	2791000	Studios has a terrific kind of a, have you seen that? It's a blender. It's like a recreation of
2791080	2797160	a grass retreat event. MacMade Studios. Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's super good. It's awesome. Yeah,
2797160	2805480	it is really good. But yeah, I wish more people would be public, man. Have you verified the guy
2805480	2813080	that- Yes, this is the second part of your question, Patrick, that I still talk. You know, I don't
2813080	2820840	want to, I don't want to go too far into this because I don't, yeah, I don't know how much
2822040	2832680	everyone's comfortable. So to a certain extent, I'll say that I have verified the person who sent
2832680	2841000	the text, kind of claiming that, so the context is Michael sent a, actually called,
2842520	2847000	actually this is good to explain because people don't know the context. So Michael called one of
2847000	2854840	the five Marines who witnessed this event with him to see if they'd be willing to kind of come
2854920	2865480	forward with him and, you know, be public. And he left a message and the guy replied later,
2865480	2870360	I think it was several days later, with the text message. And that's why, so like I posted the
2870360	2876840	text message. I had seen the message like months and months prior and I talked to Michael about it.
2876840	2882600	I was like, hey, do you think I can post the actual screenshot of the message? And I censored out like
2882600	2886520	the messages above and people were like, why did, you know, we want to see what was asked and all
2886520	2891400	that. The reason why it was censored is the text messages involved were from like weeks prior,
2891400	2898920	months prior. Michael had called him, left the message, but then this person responded via text.
2898920	2905480	So hopefully that kind of explains it a little bit more. But yeah, I'll just leave it there for
2905480	2911160	now because, you know, like Michael says, like none of the guys that he witnessed this with
2912520	2917320	want anything to do with this, you know, like you've got to remember like they all signed NDAs
2917320	2926520	threatening their lives and jail time and all of that. And Michael kind of, you know, violated
2926520	2932520	that NDA by coming forward. So I don't want to do anything at all to, you know, kind of
2933400	2939480	make them upset. And it's just something I'm kind of setting aside for now.
2939480	2944200	Any noticeable or notable case in Louisiana probably closest, I know, is Cape to Rodeau
2944200	2948840	1941. And that's a really interesting case. Let's try to get some of these thoughts on
2948840	2952920	Brandon Fugle and Travis Taylor. I don't have many thoughts or opinions on Brandon Fugle,
2952920	2956120	to be honest. I do think it's kind of weird. He never followed up with a green street about the
2957000	2963720	about the Shunker Patrick thing. But I don't have many thoughts or Travis Taylor is the
2963720	2968120	dude on Skinwalker Ranch, right? Travis Taylor, yeah. I don't know. I've never watched Skinwalker
2968120	2972200	Ranch. Any TV show, whether it's Ghost Hunters or any reality show. I mean, he's had other
2974200	2977960	because he has a PhD then. Yeah, he's been involved with UAT.
2977960	2982520	Tell us now, there's plans are strange. Joel says we are too. I'm really interested in Tums
2982520	2989160	lately. An interesting kind of piece on that. I don't think it's in print anymore as UFO highway
2989160	2993960	book. If you get in contact with me, I'll send that to you because it's really interesting.
2993960	2999240	I don't want to be very confused about the Nazca bodies. There's a website on this,
2999240	3005480	I want you to check out. Let me pull that up. Sorry, let me pull this up. If you're watching,
3005560	3016440	if you're interested in the bodies, it's called Crap. It's called alien-alien-project.com and you
3016440	3021160	can look at the 3D scans of all the bodies and that's just a really cool thing to look at. I don't
3021160	3025080	really have an opinion on them right now because I haven't studied too much, but it's very strange.
3026200	3032200	Ryan Roberts, 5K, USD announced who it is. I don't know who it is and so I cannot do that.
3033000	3040600	Well, where do you think the huge unmovable object that UFO Ross says,
3040600	3046760	I have heard rumors that this is Pine Gap Australia and I think that that's
3047640	3052840	probably like a pretty interesting place. I know TV said Seoul, South Korea and I know
3052840	3059000	there was a pretty good Reddit investigation in South Korea, but I'm not 100% sure if that's
3059000	3065160	accurate. Recommendations, I don't really dig into this. Yes, dude, just read into tons of
3065160	3070440	documents. That's all I can say. The way I started this was I'm just a normal dude. I'm kind of an
3070440	3075320	idiot. I like to get punched in the face for fun. I just read a lot. Speaking of jujitsu.
3075960	3081480	Yeah, I try and catalog everything I can do. My drink and sauce by the bottle, I do not. Soy
3081560	3088280	sauce. This is kombucha. It's really good, by the way. Yes, sir, I would love to.
3088280	3093240	Can we get you cloned, dude? No, I'm not giving you my DNA. That'd be weird. It'd probably be pretty
3093240	3097960	annoying to hang out with the clone of me. I'm sorry, guys. I'm trying to look through.
3098680	3104760	Yeah, Xavier, that good shout on Travis Taylor. Yeah, I thought UAP Task Force, he was on UAP
3104760	3111240	Task Force. Yeah, I completely agree with that. That's something that TV commented on in his emails.
3111720	3116200	Specifically, University Affiliated Research Centers. I still need to do some digging there,
3116200	3121400	but I think that there's some interesting things there. Taylor was also on UAP-TF. Yeah, I'm sorry,
3121400	3127960	I didn't mention that, guys. Thanks, both of you, for bringing that up. I like, of course,
3127960	3131320	not something that's pretty interesting, but there's, of course, some controversy there.
3131960	3138200	I like Monop AFD. I like nuclear-based incursion. One of my favorite stories is Bob Jacobs. Of
3138200	3143480	course, that's a dummy warhead, but you're familiar with Bob Jacobs, right? I love that story. Jesus,
3143480	3150520	all this. Okay, come on, man. Anyone bring up those new move-on photos? Yeah, we kind of touched
3150520	3157160	on a little bit. The photos are interesting, of course, but I don't know what to say. It's just
3157160	3161960	a photo, and I think the dude on the live just wanted to flash it up for a second and bring it
3161960	3167880	down. I don't know. It's a weird photo. I can't really say anything more than a strange
3168280	3172840	photo. Yeah, this is really interesting. Blue, Elizondo, and Steven G. Bean are odds with each
3172840	3177800	other. Gray said that a few thousand four-in-init tic-tacs are man-made ARBs and calls Lou a
3177800	3183720	disinformation agent. Lou has basically called Gray a fraud. So the whole thing with Green
3183720	3189080	Street and Lou, I think you guys will probably think is super interesting. I find that super
3189080	3195800	interesting. There is a strange absence of documents around Lou, and they tip, but I think
3195800	3202360	Lou is a fantastic person, but he seems like he wants disclosure, and I'm actually kind of
3202360	3210600	excited for his book. Yeah, you're going to look good. Okay, hey, this is a good point, man.
3210600	3214760	So what we kind of talked about earlier, when I brought up the 1974 Chihuahua incident,
3215560	3220840	this is in Kaio-Mei, the same region where sploxide occurs. So we're talking about the
3220920	3226680	Sentinels of Atheropoeia. Yeah, Sentinels of Atheropoeia 2004, JSA. The insider is kind of
3227320	3234280	having produced and is going through the officer review right now. So it takes place in this.
3234280	3240120	So I have a little conspiracy theory that I'm trying to look through that this 1974 Kaio-Mei
3240120	3246280	case with the American operators taking down the Mexican military retrieval team is the case
3246280	3250600	referenced in Sentinels of Atheropoeia. I need to keep looking at that, but that's something I
3251960	3256280	need to keep going through. Has my course to you? Yeah, he's talked about this kind of a lot
3257400	3263720	in terms of, he said his father has been threatened, and he says he's seen curious
3264360	3269560	kind of flyovers of helicopters almost circling strafing his place of work and so forth.
3271240	3274840	You want to touch on that before I get to this next question? Oh, no, that's all right. All right,
3274840	3278520	contact, arrival, or interstellar. That's a tough question, man, but I got to go with interstellar.
3279480	3284840	Time and no time for caution, or no time for caution is one of the best film songs of all time.
3284840	3287480	You've seen interstellar. Yeah, I would say interstellar too. Yeah, the scores.
3289720	3293160	Interstellar is a fan. All of these are great movies, especially contact. That's
3293160	3297800	severely underrated with Joni Foster. You've seen that, right? I don't think I have actually, man.
3297800	3304280	You got to see it. Yeah. That's any idea why JSOC is coming up in here. Yes, because if this
3305080	3308920	insider is telling the truth, and he's not just a disinfo guy, and he's trying to disseminate
3308920	3314120	information through Sentinels of Ether, there's a reason why he's bringing up JSOC. I just don't
3314120	3322040	understand the Sentinels of Ether. No, the disinfo angle with Michael. I also don't get the...
3322040	3326520	Like, what's the logic, guys? Like, tell me what the logic is. Like, Michael came forward,
3326520	3331960	most people didn't believe him, and so why would there be a... Like, what's the agenda? I don't
3331960	3339400	get it. You know, like, I just don't understand. And I mean, at this point, I'm like so confident
3339400	3346200	that this guy is who he says he is for a variety of reasons. I mean, I don't have, like, definitive
3346200	3352360	proof, because that would be me going through that black side and seeing it for myself. And
3352360	3356200	obviously, I didn't do that. So, like, I'm like a couple steps removed from that, I guess.
3357160	3361080	And Django. That's love, man. And that's a really cute... Do you see that?
3361080	3364200	Oh, my God. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that.
3365720	3370360	If not... If non-disclosure, if non-human intelligence exists, do you think government
3370360	3374200	wouldn't officially say, no, I don't? I don't know how many elements in government officially
3374200	3378440	know this. I'd like to look back to the early 1950s. This is something I just talked about in
3378440	3384360	the infographics video, too, within Truman and Eisenhower, and kind of the heavy possibility of
3384680	3389240	U.S. government elements losing track of the UAP situation at that time. If we look back to the
3389240	3395080	40s and 50s, you have scientists like Herman Auberth and so forth who you're talking and actually
3395080	3400360	making flight measurements and estimates of UAP flight characteristics. So, back at this time,
3400360	3405400	it was pretty well thought out to be non-human intelligence and flying saucers and so forth.
3405400	3411320	So, I don't think this is going to be done by the people. By the people, hopefully, and I hope
3411320	3415400	this, people in programs that Grush has talked about, some of his 40 witnesses, these people need
3415400	3423880	to start to test apart. Yeah. It's kind of an annoying bit of silence. What do you think of
3423880	3427080	Charles Hall? That name sounds familiar, but I can't remember. Do you know Charles Hall?
3427080	3435240	So, Julian Grocks, if you can tell me, best favorite UFO photo, my profile picture, 2006
3435240	3440520	or 2007, Wisconsin, there's a series of two of them. I love this image. I look at it just
3440520	3445880	something that kind of makes me feel a little scared inside. What do you say? I don't really
3445880	3451560	have a favorite, but I can respect why you feel like that's really compelling.
3452840	3458600	It's a great series of images that I'll provide on my community notes. There's a good kind of story
3458600	3464040	in the summary of the people who took the photos and so forth, and there's two cases of it.
3464600	3469160	Really interesting. Would you like to hear your research on value authority?
3469480	3472920	Somebody was talking about Valiant Thor in the Twitter space the other day. That's when I
3472920	3475640	messaged you and I said, these guys are talking about value authority. Oh, that's right. Yeah.
3475640	3480600	I first heard about that. I think it was Jason Sands. It was Sands? Yeah, he was on a live. He was
3480600	3485720	on an X space, rather. Okay, Valiant Thor, for any of you who don't know, Valiant Thor is like a
3485720	3491720	supposed Venusian extraterrestrial that came down in the, I think Eisenhower administration
3491720	3496120	and basically worked in the Pentagon. I first heard about this on a podcast called Mysterious
3496120	3499720	Universe. It's a really good podcast. It's a little tongue-in-cheeked, a little silly. If any of
3499720	3505720	you guys have heard that, I absolutely love that podcast. But that story is a bit, I mean, I have
3505720	3510840	no confirming evidence or things to disprove the story, but I find it a little strange that
3510840	3517560	basically an uncanny valley type human is working in the Pentagon, but I don't know. I don't have
3517560	3523880	anything to, I don't have anything to debunk that story, but I do find it a little strange.
3524120	3531400	Let's keep seeing. I do agree with what DeLaunch had on Steve's pot about Valiant Thor. I don't
3531400	3538600	know what he said, so if you know what he said, please let me know. Ross Holt Hart said it is
3538600	3547400	a psionic. Yeah, so the psionic in the, I think that was in the AMA, you know, like what's one
3547400	3552920	word everyone should be looking into to kind of push things forward or learn more about what's
3552920	3561080	going on. He said psionic. And from my perspective, that is a 100% direct reference to Michael's
3561080	3568520	testimony, you know, relaying information from the insider. Okay, that's my opinion.
3569880	3579240	And I'll just repeat that Ross is actively investigating Michael's case and finds it incredible.
3579240	3584280	I'll say that I have not talked to Ross, especially about Michael. So like, I can't add
3584280	3589800	anything there. I would love to speak to Ross, but no, like, I know you've talked to Ross, but I have
3589800	3595080	not. Yeah, I've not spoken to Ross. So I mean, I could be wrong, but like that word for me, the
3595080	3600520	first, I never heard psionic until Michael brought it up. And that was like a big part of, you know,
3600520	3606280	the whole, the whole thing with, I think I first heard about like psionic stuff back in like 20,
3606280	3611000	I can't remember the 2020s when those supposed A tip slides leaked from Chris Mellon's personal
3611000	3615240	website. I think it's slide nine, which talks like what's considered like the phenomenon is not
3615240	3620280	considered quantum physics and talk about kind of a consciousness affecting of being approximately
3620280	3625960	the UAP and so forth. So that is super, super interesting. I don't know because, you know,
3625960	3631160	I'm not a psychic. If I was, I'd make better YouTube videos, but I'm not a psychic. I don't
3631160	3635000	know anybody not psychic. So that of course is one of the toughest things for me to wrap my head
3635000	3639880	around. What soft disclosure points? I don't know because you have close encounters of the third
3639880	3644680	kind and you have a really weird, you have a lot of parallels to real life, like that eccentric
3644680	3650040	French scientist who is basically a movie analog analog to a Jacques Valais and the J. Allen,
3650040	3655320	Heineck type scientists. So I don't know, but that I'd be interested to find out. I agree.
3655960	3659720	Jay Sock was also mentioned in the article exposing the OGA. Yes, the OGA is something I'm
3659720	3663880	trying to invent investigate right now as we speak. I think that's so interesting. There's a couple
3663880	3669400	guys I'm talking to that have some poignant points on OGA and my car wolf, the former head and so
3669400	3674120	forth. So that'd be interesting. All right. What does this say? So David Gruss has confirmed that
3674120	3679160	deep state is real thoughts on the legitimacy of the USA government. Democracy is fake. I definitely
3679160	3684760	think there is a program that studies reverse engineering. We're like looking around the camera
3684760	3689000	questions to see the questions. At least from everything I've studied, I'd like to support
3689000	3693560	the thesis that there is evidence that there is a crash retrieval in reverse engineering
3693560	3699720	project that is not necessarily run by USG elements with oversight. Yeah. I mean, this stuff,
3700600	3707160	this stuff's so crazy, guys. Like I totally understand that. I mean, it's, it's, I don't know.
3707160	3714760	It's, I really don't know. It's just recalculation. Wait, but the text message from his bussy who
3714760	3725320	tells him he isn't too deep. I think your comments more common. Okay, let's keep going through.
3728520	3733080	I don't know if I consider her at this info, but the play devil's advocate would definitely
3733080	3737640	be value in elevating false whistleblowers to discredit people indirectly the whole prospect.
3737640	3742520	Yeah, totally agree. And I didn't think at the 2023, there's some kind of a little bit of false
3742520	3747640	whistleblowers and so forth. Well, one, one thing I don't understand, like people kind of
3748440	3753160	call this a Dodie Benowitz situation. And the thing I don't understand about that at all is,
3753720	3760760	you know, Benowitz didn't have the same type of experience that Herrera did. Benowitz intercepted
3760760	3766040	communications, if I'm correct. Yeah, I think it was near Mallory. No, no, that's Kenneth Arnold
3766040	3771240	near a kind of like a plateau. He thought he was intercepting like communication between
3771960	3779080	NHI and so Dodie came in and like supported that idea and like egged it on. This is like the
3779080	3788280	opposite. Like Michael saw anti gravity craft. It flew off. There's like no mistaking what his
3788280	3795240	testimony is from his perspective. So it makes no sense if Michael was making this up.
3796040	3800920	How could an insider come in and like egg him on about it being like, Oh, yeah, I saw the operation
3800920	3807320	you came, you stumbled upon. If Michael knows he's making it up, you would know the insider is lying
3807320	3812440	to him about, you know, knowing what operation he stumbled upon. So I just, I just don't even see the
3812440	3818360	logic of how that would work. So I kind of find that that comparison a little silly. Yeah, I need
3818360	3823960	to let's let's scroll keep going through. Sorry, we're trying to get through all these whack-a-mechs.
3824680	3828200	Much love, brother. Thank you. What do you think about the idea of agreements with NHI?
3828200	3831560	It's really interesting. David Gresh has commented on that as pretty much fact.
3832760	3837720	One of the things that I remember is I think it's 1954, Holloman Air Force based landing
3837720	3842040	with Eisenhower coming down to contact extra terrestrials and making some agreement with
3842040	3846760	them. There's stories that this is to allow extra terrestrials to do abductions and so forth.
3847400	3853320	And Greer has some interesting whistleblowers in his log that talked about observing like the 54
3853320	3857400	Holloman landing, what these agreements could be, why these agreements are with people that live in
3857400	3863800	this continent and not others, or if Russia is going to come out and say that Russia, China has
3863800	3868360	their own agreements. I don't know. I find it really interesting, but I struggle a lot to find out,
3868360	3876120	to think what those agreements could be. Why would an NHI, why would a NHI species need to
3876120	3881400	make agreements with humans? Yeah, I mean, it's like a lot of speculation. I really don't know.
3881400	3886280	Yeah, speculation. And there's some pretty interesting stories around there, but I really
3886280	3889640	hope we can get to the bottom of that or hear more from Gresh because I don't know.
3889640	3895720	I mean, he alluded to it. No, no, no. He said in a Ross Bullard interview in the first one,
3895720	3901320	the News Nation one, Ross says something like an agreement has been made with NHI and Gresh says,
3901320	3907720	yeah. So I don't know. Wait, is that the Joey? Yes, this is the Joey, man. This is Joey. It's not
3907720	3911000	my name. I mean, my name's not Joey, but I am Joey. It's not my name.
3912600	3918920	Quitter. Yeah, I struggle with this every day. The abduction, psionic ET communication is the
3918920	3926520	hardest part for me to wrap my head around. Yeah, and honestly, guys, I seriously think I've got
3926520	3931560	this cognitive dissonance sometimes when I'm investigating this case, and I focus in on the
3931560	3938040	tangible stuff that, you know, is in my kind of reality of what the real world is like. And so
3938040	3943640	I focus on the military stuff, the operation and things like that. And I kind of like take
3944520	3951720	a bigger, crazy picture of what Michael's claiming and just set it aside. Because like,
3951720	3961160	it's such a wild change for like how I understand what works, that it's hard for me to really accept
3961240	3966440	it. Yeah, it's something like I'm actively studying to learn more about. But, you know, for
3967160	3970760	somebody with an engineering background who's really interested in craft,
3970760	3975160	pressure, trivose, more so tangible stuff, it's really difficult for me to understand, especially
3975160	3979800	because, you know, I've had no like personal experiences with any sort of psychicness.
3981960	3987480	Laxative pain is out of play on Max pain. Thank you so much. Just dropping the Max pain right in
3987880	3993640	there. Oh, hey, that was a good game. Max pain three is going on. I played the OG Max pain
3994680	3999880	for those kind of slow and the activist GTA. I'll check that out tonight, man. Fose 1997. I
3999880	4007400	really appreciate you brother. Thoughts on Ashton and the NH three 70 videos. I don't know much.
4007400	4012840	I try to stay out of that because that seems like a really big kind of a rabbit hole. I have heard
4012840	4019800	many people say that those are debunked, but I really don't know, man. I try to say out of that.
4019800	4024600	I remember when that video was released, I was like, holy crap, that's really cool. I really don't
4024600	4034520	know much to be honest. What about you? Yeah, I mean, it's, it seems pretty compelling that they're
4035240	4045480	hoaxed. However, and I don't really like Ashton's reaction to a lot of really logical kind of
4045480	4051160	presentations like the raw the raw photos finding the original photographer took the raw photos of
4051160	4058360	the clouds and the sequence and he's kind of, you know, comebacks to those are relatively weak and
4058360	4064440	kind of emotional reactions. However, there are certain things that I find interesting
4065160	4076760	about the context of the way the videos were put together, I guess, and it makes me almost
4076760	4085480	wonder if maybe they are hoaxed, but maybe they're hoaxed by a high level government
4085880	4091800	not just a senior person, not just like a random dude like in his basement, but like maybe this was
4091800	4099800	a kind of official like project to put this out for some sort of reason because there's
4099800	4103880	there's things about the satellite, like the specific satellite that was, you know, supposedly
4103880	4110200	taking images that like how would the person know this within the timeframe and just like the
4110200	4115240	alignment of a lot of different things. And so there's a lot of, I haven't gone too deep into
4115240	4122040	it, I've really just focused on Herrera's case, but and I don't like how Ashton is handling
4123560	4129160	a lot of the criticisms and stuff, but there's still like a little piece there that I do find
4129160	4134520	interesting. Matt Ford announced that maybe the OGA has changed recently. Yeah, I remember
4134520	4138360	when that Daily Mail article about the OGA came out too, there seemed to be a lot of
4138360	4142280	kind of changes from the internet archive on kind of the flow of information from how to access the
4142280	4147480	OGA. The OGA is super interesting. Sorry, just trying to scroll through some of the questions.
4149480	4154440	Should I still report it to move on? Edward, tell me, man. Send me an email. I want to hear
4154440	4157560	about it. You might be good about gmail.com, gata scamming. I want to hear about your experience,
4157560	4161400	man. That sounds incredible. This is a great question. What are your opinions on, I think
4161400	4167160	that was a really bad idea for you to come down with on Twitter. Yeah, unfortunately, and I think
4168120	4177400	part of the thing that I think Mr. Sands made as a kind of mistake was going too much into being
4177400	4183320	too generous with providing his speculative thoughts on different questions that were totally
4183320	4192440	unrelated to his direct experience of what his encounter and his job. Because what happens is
4192440	4198680	now people get that sound bite and they think he's speaking that from a firsthand perspective
4198680	4205880	and it just kind of muddies the water. One thing that's interesting that I think we can talk about
4206440	4212680	regarding Sands, so we actually had another meeting yesterday with Michael and another individual
4213720	4217800	who was kind of behind the scenes. He's someone in the intelligence community,
4218440	4227480	someone I've been speaking to for a while, and he kind of vouched for the fact that Jason Sands
4227480	4232600	was participating in the UAP Task Force Forum. So there was some, you know, that you guys probably
4232600	4238920	remember that argument about, you know, Sands said he was part of the UAP Task Force and
4240280	4244920	but then he's like, well, I mean the forum and people kind of flipped out about that.
4245560	4253160	But from what this IC person that we saw yesterday kind of explained to us was like,
4253160	4258920	that's kind of how it was. There was like the UAP Task Force Forum was kind of this,
4258920	4265880	it's essentially like a collaborative platform that's behind, you know, a top secret clearance,
4265880	4272120	but it's accessible to a wide range of intelligence community individuals. And so what was happening
4272120	4278040	was people who were officially part of the UAP Task Force might reach out to someone in the
4278760	4283640	NGA or something and be like, oh, have you guys seen this or that? And like, you know,
4283640	4288760	people who had a personal interest in UAP could just jump in there and kind of like be like,
4288760	4293800	on the side, like do a little bit of research and like, you know, give it to the task force.
4293800	4300200	And so it was kind of, you know, the way I kind of understand it is like, you kind of felt like
4300200	4304200	you were part of the UAP Task Force if you were just part of that group. It's kind of like if
4304200	4308200	you're on like a discord chat, you would say like, oh yeah, I'm part of that group. Yeah. You know,
4308200	4313160	if you're, you know, so the way, yeah, the way we heard is you participated in kind of this forum,
4313160	4317880	so forth, kind of contributed to the UAP Task Force. And that's when he told the story.
4319000	4325720	And kind of a lot of really interesting people kind of find Sam's credible or think he's just
4325720	4330360	a fantastic person. They have wonderful things to say. Yeah. I mean, like his character alone,
4330360	4335800	I've only heard very positive things about his character. So I think, I think it's just kind
4335800	4341560	of the way he decided to come forward, just had him come forward on wrong foot. And yeah. And
4341560	4347560	again, like for me personally, I feel like it's important for whistleblowers, especially when
4347560	4353800	they first come forward, stick to your direct experiences, let people know what you're speculating.
4353800	4358920	Yeah. Or just be like, you know, I don't want to go there. Like just to cement in people's minds,
4358920	4362840	like this is their direct experience. Sorry, you're trying to like hammer through all these
4362840	4367080	questions. And I'm not going to be standing on. That's kind of, that's what we did with our Michael.
4367080	4372600	How much from, what time do you want to go to? Okay, we'll go to 5.20. So eight minutes, guys,
4372600	4377000	then we got to hop off, right? Yeah. So we'll do just a question of them. But for an interview with
4377000	4382760	Michael, we try to make sure that, that every time he was speculating about something, he made
4382760	4387960	it clear, just because we want to kind of hammer down his case from his words. So let's keep,
4387960	4391400	let's get through these. We'll stay on for a little bit more. Trollmama, thank you so much.
4391400	4397080	And I like that little beaver, beaver running through. I really appreciate you. Above Black
4397080	4401480	by Dan Sherman, I was told to read this yesterday. So I'm going to be reading that and kind of,
4401480	4405080	I'll check it and let you know what I think. I think that's my next read. Please look into
4405080	4410440	Jason Thans a little deeper. Yes. I'm currently trying to get in contact with Sans to speak to
4410440	4416120	him. I really want to talk to him. I think this was a response to the question on the guy saying
4416120	4421960	he was playing devil's advocate about Michael and the fake purposeful disinformation. I don't
4421960	4425800	think necessarily an example of elevated pulse was born. Yeah, suspicious about Jason Sans,
4425800	4428840	especially with how he came forward, right? Like this dude pops up on a Twitter space.
4429960	4436040	And especially when he kind of has an idea and runs with it. So, you know, I really wish our
4436040	4441720	first introduction with him was the James Fox, James Fox interview. Yeah, or like just some
4441720	4446760	other interview thoughts on Wagan. Wagan's awesome. Although he won't try to talk to him. I don't
4446760	4454440	think he wants to do more interviews. I've tried to contact him on massive, multiple platforms.
4454440	4458440	Sorry. You can't discredit the legitimate witnesses and whistleblowers coming down the pipe. You can
4458440	4461960	preemptively discredit the idea of a UFO whistleblower. If you're talking about Sans there,
4462600	4466520	I'm not shutting down Sans. I kind of need to talk to him personally before I can form a full
4466520	4471320	opinion, just because of how strange his coming out was on Twitter and so forth. There's a lot
4471320	4475480	of messiness there and a lot of murky waters. Because I know there's been a lot of discussion
4475480	4480760	around him and so forth. Is there any evidence at all for abductions being real? I don't know.
4483240	4487000	We were talking about the Travis Walton case today and neither of us really know what to think
4487000	4491160	about that. I don't know. I try and stay a little away from abductions a little bit,
4491160	4502600	because I know it's pretty murky. Why assuming NHI is a biological life form,
4502600	4506520	why would anything more powerful than us? I don't know. It's an interesting question.
4508120	4512920	Especially so many hypotheses as to why NHI are here and interacting or not interacting with us
4512920	4519800	is new hypothesis for one. That's a great question. It looks like anonymous is leaving
4519800	4525800	us gang. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry I disappointed you, dude. Without disclosing names or locations,
4525800	4533720	can Joey explain? Yeah, you talked about that earlier, right? Yeah. It started from a piece of
4533720	4543800	evidence that I was able to corroborate it with multiple public sources, data sources. At this
4543800	4548520	point, I've said I've tracked the helicopter. I was able to figure out the exact helicopter that
4548520	4557320	he was on. He flew to this location. Naturally, anyone, if you know a specific aircraft, you can
4557320	4566200	go and look on flight radar and see where it went at a certain time. That was my initial thing that
4566200	4574200	was like, holy crap. Even after that, I have, now at this point, it's just, there's no doubt whatsoever.
4575160	4580280	My issue with Greer, yeah, I completely agree with that. He tried, what I've noticed and possibly
4580280	4584360	heard is that when he has a witness, he tries to claim the mess as his own so he can be the
4584360	4588440	central figure and central point of contact for everything. Trollmama, I think there's
4588440	4593320	plenty of people investigating. There's a lot of, there's a lot of really good channels on YouTube,
4593320	4598280	a lot of great people. My butthole is your butthole, Ashton. What the heck?
4598360	4599960	You didn't hear about that one? No.
4602840	4609560	We don't need to go into it. It was his little logic witness test talking about the
4610600	4615320	effects effect that was on. How does that have to do with investigating? Because he thinks all
4615320	4620760	explosions have the same pattern. He's like, you have a butthole, I have a butthole, but my
4620760	4625000	butthole's not your butthole. It was just so cringey. If you want people to take this seriously,
4625000	4629560	why would technology so overheads? Yeah, I'd like to think back to the, if we were to
4629560	4634200	give a smartphone to the ancient Romans or a nuclear bomb to people in the Victorian era.
4635400	4640920	Interesting question. I believe, I believe, so it looks like a lot of people are kind of commenting
4640920	4646200	or talking about psionics. A lot of people are kind of open to this idea, reading more,
4646200	4650440	paying attention more. That's something that I need to educate myself more on.
4651000	4656280	Yeah, there was actually a couple of people that asked this elsewhere, but Michael had
4657000	4663080	alluded to last year, actually, he was going to be kind of going out and meeting the insider again
4663080	4675400	and seeing like a demonstration of one of these psionics, attracting, calling a craft or something
4675400	4680600	like that. That kind of, that was supposed to happen last year. That fell through. Things are
4680600	4686040	kind of up in the air about that right now. It makes sense. I understand why I can't, I can't
4686040	4693320	really talk about why, but at this point, I honestly don't even think that would be even
4694200	4698200	something that, because I was kind of nervous about it to begin with, because like what,
4698200	4701960	you know, even if you could like videotape that or something, is it just going to be three, is it
4701960	4705640	just going to be three lights in the sky? Yeah. And I was kind of like, I don't know if that's
4705640	4711720	even going to be a good thing to do. And so there's other things that are kind of trying to be put
4711720	4718200	together in the background that I think are going to be a better path forward to help support
4719000	4725560	disclosure. I'll say that much. Let's keep going. So that might still happen. It's just the, I don't
4725560	4729960	know when. Thank you, brother. I appreciate the help. Samuel, forget that's a cool profile,
4730440	4735000	I've not read Trinity. I've heard a little bit of a D. Dean Johnson kind of trying to discredit
4735000	4738920	that case because I know Jacques Malay has worked on it. So I've kind of worked on that case,
4738920	4742680	but I need to educate myself a little more on that. And I would like to read Trinity and I
4742680	4748360	would like to read what a D&D Johnson says. Gary Nolan worked on a project for CIA,
4748360	4755080	someone we trust. I don't know. Gary Nolan seems to be a, I know nothing like a negative or anything
4755080	4759400	about Gary Nolan seems like an interesting do kind of pushing for disclosure. I hope his
4759400	4766360	head's in the right place. Yeah, I haven't heard about that either. But okay, bro, say this is
4766360	4769080	legit. If you listen to his interview, he's very reserved and is free to speak more. Yes,
4769080	4773640	that's why I want to talk to him because there's so much kind of drama and controversy around him
4773640	4778280	online and kind of social media spaces. But I want to talk to him and hear his story from his words.
4779160	4785720	But he still said 20 back. Yeah, I remember it like, back in like 2016 or so, I heard the first,
4785800	4792760	that first dude, he said the 20 and back thing was a thing to go work at, like they're mining on
4792760	4799240	the moon with reptilians. That requires some extraordinary proof for that. So that is,
4799240	4803080	that is something a bit strange. All right, let's get through these and then we'll start
4803080	4808040	wrapping up eminent domain. I don't think that eminent domain will ever happen. There's also
4808040	4812680	other people we've talked to, not like whistleblowers or anything, just guys with interesting
4812760	4817320	backgrounds that also don't think that happened. Private aerospace have legal rights to exploit
4817320	4822040	technology despite potential legal technology transfers. Yeah, I think probably what David
4822040	4826920	brush says is pretty interesting has a lot through it that a lot of technology is specifically craft
4826920	4831800	is stored in private domain to avoid any sort of kind of eminent domain grab or any sort of
4831800	4836040	access to this craft keeps things off books and projects and so forth. You have anything to add?
4836360	4842840	Go ahead. Okay, sorry, I just joined. Was it Joey supposed to be anonymous? Yes,
4842840	4847240	he was, but this is Joey. Well, it's like, I was never like, supposedly, it's like, if you
4847240	4852200	do you have a Reddit account? Are you anonymous on Reddit? Yeah, me too. So like, I got into this
4852200	4857080	whole thing and I was just like, that just kind of maintained. And then it got to a point where
4857080	4861880	everyone was like, why are you anonymous? And it's like, well, I don't know. And, and, you know,
4861880	4867800	things were getting, I didn't know how much dangerous put myself in. And I think at this point,
4868600	4873000	the kind of secret stuff that I knew that I was kind of nervous about having and wanted to remain
4873000	4878120	anonymous about Michael has has talked about now. So I feel a lot more comfortable kind of at least
4878120	4884120	show my face. And so I decided to do that. So because I feel like the longer I kind of remain
4884120	4887640	completely in the shadows, like the worst that's going to get in. So it really wasn't a big deal
4887640	4892360	to begin with. And so that's just why. All right, let's get through these.
4893880	4896840	Hey, what's up, Dutch in case that is a super interesting case. I think I did that in the
4896840	4901400	first ever iceberg video. Betty and Barney Hills granddaughter is a UFC fighter, Angela Hill. She
4901400	4905720	talked about that on JRE once. That was pretty interesting. I like that case. That's a really
4905720	4912200	interesting thing. Monster Hunter. Love you. For me, Travis Walton and the passing goal,
4912200	4916280	sorry, you guys know I can't pronounce anything. Our plenty evidence that NHI abductions are
4916280	4920440	in a real phenomenon. The thing with me is I kind of sit me to sit down and do like a full
4920440	4924520	investigation for myself to reach any sort of conclusion. Like I like to sit through,
4924520	4930840	read multiple books, kind of way, way things and really sit down and abductions is one thing I
4930840	4940920	really haven't given a ton of time or focus to. What about you? Yeah, I mean, guys, I'm not like
4940920	4947000	I'm not Gerb Gerbs, like researching like all these different cases and stuff. Like I, I'm just
4947000	4952680	like a normal dude. I was like a regular, like some random Redditor guy and like a rare case,
4952680	4957480	just somehow I got wrapped up into it. And that's kind of what I've been focusing on. And, you know,
4957480	4964040	so I'd love to sometime in the future, like make a website with all my documents as a repository
4964040	4969800	because I have so dang many. And, you know, like in all the, the show and all the times put the
4969800	4975480	documents and stuff I'd lead to, but I'd love like a central database of everything there.
4975480	4979320	Yeah, Forgotten Language is a super interesting. I first read that in the anonymous briefing
4979320	4985320	document for, for Congress in 2023. The Forgotten Language thing is, is sweet. There's this really
4985320	4989800	cool group of people, some great people that did a deep dive into Forgotten Languages. I need to
4989800	4994600	kind of get educated from them. Are you going back to the 1933 case I'd like to after those
4994600	4999160	recent release of RS33 documents? Big on the crypto terrestrial hypothesis, that's super
4999240	5004760	interesting too. I'd like to visit back. Trinity case is weak. You know, I need to study that as well.
5004760	5012200	Let's, I hear you, not Joey yet, not Joey. Sorry, but who was sued a broke brother? If you've seen
5012200	5018360	it in my videos, I'm Gert. This is Joey. Joey's not my name on Reddit. I'm sorry, man. I'm Gert.
5019560	5024360	Okay, let's see. Can't wait for the Obama movie. Yeah, that's weird. The Obama movie about the hill.
5024920	5031000	Yeah, but he's learning hill. Yeah. Harry. Hey, look at that dog. That's a very cute dog. True nuts
5031000	5035320	and bolts. I don't know. I got to study anything else. And Harry, thank you so much for, for both
5035320	5041640	of this. I'd like to say as, as kind of like a, but this is a great point. If abductions are
5041640	5045000	other logical, if we visit another planet, we would sample the floor and on absolutely,
5045960	5050680	absolutely. That's why it's not something to just throw away, but needs to be kind of investigated.
5051320	5055800	I would like to say for this live, you know, we didn't really know what to expect. We just kind
5055800	5061240	of wanted to talk about Michael and so forth. And you guys came with so many awesome questions.
5061240	5065320	Like this was actually really fun. So, you know, if, if you guys would like to see,
5065320	5069640	to do some more lives or see some like that, I would you want to do some more? Maybe a live
5069640	5075480	or you know, so it's like, all right, I have a ton of respect for what you do. I, I have been so
5075480	5081000	apprehensive about like becoming a content creator because it's like, you, you're very vulnerable
5081000	5086600	because, you know, if you talk about or investigate a case that you like, and you put some credibility
5086600	5090840	into it, then like later it turns out to be a complete lie on the line. It's kind of like,
5090840	5097240	that's now attached to you. And I'm like, so afraid to do that. And, and, and like this community can
5097240	5102680	can be very toxic. But like, I got to say, like your, your followers are so great. I think they
5102680	5108360	recognize like the amount of work you put into, you know, the cases that you, you create videos on
5108360	5113240	and stuff. Also, if I ever like needed hoodwinked or anything like that, and the case turns out to
5113240	5118040	be false, I'll come out and say it like, if I'm wrong about something, I'll totally do it. I,
5118040	5122360	I would like to cause that helps disclosure, right? Yeah, it's, it's, it's, yeah, it's, it's a trick.
5122360	5127080	It's like a tight wire, a tight rope because, you know, and like, how much do you talk about
5127160	5133000	speculation and then, and get into that. And, you know, even if you say like, oh, this is speculation,
5133000	5138520	people are going to be like, oh wait, he believes this. So I would like to say that, you know,
5138520	5142280	maybe Joe, you'll join me on some live streams, maybe he won't, but it would be kind of fun to do
5142280	5149400	like a one, one live a week or something like that whenever it works for anybody else. And
5149400	5154520	that will definitely not take place of regular videos because I'll let you guys know a little
5154520	5159720	secret right now before, before we wrap things up. You guys know I mentioned this a lot.
5160920	5164600	Whoever's been mentioning Magic Eyes Only, the book by Ryan S. Wood,
5165160	5171640	focuses on Crash Retrievals and, and MJ12. Who knows this book? I'm waiting.
5173000	5177160	Anyways, we'll get to Jengie Squish real fast before I talk about that. Thank you so,
5177160	5184360	dude, your profile picture is valid. Thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that. So this,
5184360	5189160	this book, Magic Eyes Only is, I fully recommend this. I'm not sponsored by the author, by the way,
5189160	5195160	about Crash Retrievals and MJ12. The author of this book, Ryan S. Wood, whose father Robert S. Wood,
5195160	5200360	who worked contracting for various defense companies and had a lot to say about MJ12, UAP and so
5200360	5207000	forth. I have contacted Ryan S. Wood. I know him. I've talked to him multiple times on the phone.
5207000	5212280	He lives near me. I will be doing an in-person project with him, kind of doing a full dive on
5212280	5218840	the MJ12 soon too. And I cannot wait for that, man. That, that's going to be an awesome case
5218840	5224200	because the MJ12 is so complex. Like I can't have like a pea grain like myself understand
5224200	5228680	everything right away. So something with Ryan S. Wood is going to be, be really great.
5229400	5233320	Yeah. So that's really cool. We'll do more lives if you guys want. And should I keep,
5233320	5237800	you got an invite to author on the show? Yes. No, no, no, no, no. So, so you remember the
5237800	5244840	interview I had with, with, with Joey about Michael, I plan to do a documentary interview with him,
5244840	5249080	where he and I have a full conversation, but splice throughout the conversation is different
5249080	5253320	studies and anecdotes and relevant documents and kind of relevant pathways to go down,
5253320	5259240	not just he and I sitting for, oh man, nobody's selling nothing here, bro. Nobody's selling
5259240	5265720	nothing. But for, for that, for that video with Ryan S. Wood, kind of sit down with him,
5265720	5270680	do an in-person video recording and kind of make that into a documentary.
5271400	5275400	But yeah, I'll do another one of these soon guys. And if you want, should I, do you keep
5275400	5280280	live streams up? Yeah. All right. Yeah, people will watch them, right? Thank you guys so much
5280280	5286040	for joining. I really appreciate every single one of your views. Like we got like 140 viewers,
5286040	5290680	which is, which is crazy, man. I love Zambia too. I've never been, but I've only been to Morocco,
5290680	5298920	so. He's done a lot of traveling. I'd like to do some more, man. The lady was, you got,
5299960	5305160	which is not going to read it, but thank you guys so much for tuning in. I really appreciate it.
5305160	5308840	I really appreciate all the good questions. Yeah, this was, this was awesome. And I appreciate
5308840	5313720	you hosting me here and, and, you know, having these, these few days together. It's been awesome.
5313720	5317960	So we'll let the Herrera video out this as soon as possible to interview. And I'm super excited
5317960	5320840	to see what you guys think, because I'd like to open up some more discussion about that.
5320840	5322520	All right. Peace. All right. Thanks, gang.
