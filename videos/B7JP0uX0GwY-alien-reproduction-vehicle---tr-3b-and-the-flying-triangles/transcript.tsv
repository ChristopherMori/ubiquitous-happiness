0	6000	For decades, humans around the world have reported sightings of dark, triangular-shaped UFOs,
6000	13500	often featuring three bright white lights at each corner and a dull red light or structural features on the middle surface.
13500	21800	Unlike classic flying saucers, orbs, egg-shaped craft, tic-tacs, and strange organic shapes like the controversial jellyfish UAP,
21800	27300	triangles have historically not been associated with non-human intelligence, but instead,
27300	31800	with deep-sixed, black-budget human reverse engineering efforts.
31800	38500	This is somewhat due to triangular craft lacking many of the hallmarks of what some would consider NHI craft.
38500	45700	No visible means of propulsion, a lack of harsh angles and surface features, missing rivets, bolts, and seams,
45700	52500	as well as many triangular sightings occurring in concentrated periods over populated regions and military bases.
52700	57800	Triangle craft were further touched upon in the fall 2024 UAP hearings,
57800	62800	in which the shadowy, unacknowledged special access program, Immaculate Constellation,
62800	66700	saw its public report released to Congress and the American people.
66700	74000	At least some of the triangles among the rarest UAP configurations reported in the Immaculate Constellation report
74000	79600	have been confirmed by the USAP to be ARV, Alien Reproduction Vehicles,
79600	85900	the same term used by presiding program members to label the Fluxliner Flying Saucer Reproduction Vehicle
85900	91100	observed by Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Show.
91100	97700	And Representative Eric Burleson told me this was not the first time, in fact, he had heard the term ARV.
97700	105400	And I've seen and listened some, and had conversations about this with people from the UFO community
105400	112700	that will say that there's two types of aircraft there is, there's crap that is truly extraterrestrial
112700	120000	and then there's crap that we have reverse engineered and created and for reproduced, right?
120000	127500	And so that report, what is unique about the Immaculate Constellation report is it's about these reproduced,
127500	131500	you know, basically us reproducing what is crashed.
131600	137300	But are these triangles whose descriptions are often time near identical indeed human made?
137300	141100	What can we make of the whistleblower testimony of Edgar Fouchet,
141100	148300	who described these craft in great detail, including a name, the TR Tactical Reconnaissance 3B?
148300	155700	What valuable evidence can we gather from slightly different triangle variations seen from the 1980s and 1990s?
155700	160100	And why would the X-Files TV show contract a triangle designed from an artist
160100	165700	who drew an alleged reverse engineered craft called the XF-131 Super Sentinel,
165700	170300	instructed by two Lockheed Martin and two Northrop Grumman engineers?
170300	177700	Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me on another investigation into alien reproduction vehicle.
177700	182400	This time focusing on the black triangle seen throughout the globe for decades,
182400	186600	let's venture into the full story of the TR3B ARV,
186600	192800	a possible parallel joint Northrop and Lockheed ARV hailing from the Lockheed Martin-Hellendale Plan,
192800	199500	and strange possible ARV prototypes seen throughout the 1980s and 1990s with odd features.
199500	206900	Let us investigate the origins, configurations, and purposes of these craft allegedly built from NHI technology.
207500	220100	On November 13, 2024, the term ARV was entered into the Congressional Hearing Record with the Immaculate Constellation Report.
220100	224100	No, this term did not originate with Stephen Greer in 2001.
224100	229600	It can indeed be traced back to 1988 with alleged first-hand witness Brad Sorensen,
229600	236300	who observed DOD and private industry attempts to reverse engineer anti-gravity flying saucer craft.
236500	241000	And now, the Immaculate Constellation Unknown Anonymous Whistleblower Report
241000	247100	has labeled another craft configuration as alien reproduction vehicles, the triangle.
247100	252000	The report whose historical data tracked back to 2009 discussed a large,
252000	256700	equilateral triangle directly appearing over intelligence-collecting vessels.
256700	260800	Captured by Indo-PACCOM, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command,
260800	265900	the triangle hovered and rotated slowly 500 to 1,000 meters above the ocean.
265900	270900	Three bright points were seen at each bottom corner of the horizontally rotating triangle
270900	274700	with the horizontal bar of sweeping lights partially observed.
274700	279300	Collected intelligence revealed this triangle was a reproduction craft.
279300	286300	A second Indo-PACCOM entry detailed a fighter jet-sized, equilateral ARV triangle of unknown origin
286300	289500	hovering less than 200 meters above a vessel.
289500	295500	At least two lights were observed on the craft with at least one more obstructed on the underside of the craft
295500	298800	with the triangle slightly positioned at an upward angle.
298800	308000	In their 2023 and 2024 historical reports arrow-listed triangles as solely 3-4% of all reported UAPs.
308000	311000	A morphology that is indeed quite uncommon.
311000	317800	Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official UFO Investigation Program from 1952 to 1969,
317800	321800	catalogued over 12,000 cases of varying quality.
321800	326100	Let's reference this paper titled The Blue Book Unknowns by Don Berliner,
326100	331900	which utilizes numerous criteria to analyze only the most unexplained of Blue Book cases.
331900	337000	In the 1950s, we find solely four recorded anomalous triangle sightings.
337000	340100	These triangles are often described as colorful.
340100	346100	A far cry from our dark gray, black craft with three lights, the subject of today's analysis.
346100	352400	Although Arrow and Blue Book are not necessarily trustworthy, we can form a strong observation here.
352400	358300	Analyzing historical UFO reporting trends, thank you to UFOsearch.com and Richard Geldreich.
358300	368100	We can directly observe the time period of 1940 to 1970 and 2000 to modern day see few triangular craft sightings reported.
368100	377600	1970 to 2000, particularly the 1980s and 1990s, see an overwhelming number of reported triangular UFO sightings.
377600	381700	Not only does this confirm the data and claims made further in this video,
381700	387600	but this also suggests a worldwide multi-decade UFO flap of triangle-shaped craft.
387600	393200	With the cases and testimony we will explore in this video, a strong thesis could be constructed.
393300	403700	That sometime in the 1970s, legacy UFO programs began constructing triangular alien reproduction vehicles based on non-human triangular craft
403700	410600	and iterated on and tested such craft over military bases during the 1980s to 2000s.
410600	416000	And let's also reference the controversial Majestic 12 document titled Somme 101,
416000	419700	or the Special Operations Manual I covered at length with Ryan Wood.
419700	423900	In the description of craft from this document allegedly dated 1954,
423900	430000	we can find description of triangular-shaped craft amongst the saucers, spheres, cigars, etc.
430000	431600	The triangles read, quote,
431600	437300	This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and recency of observations.
437300	443800	Radar indicates Nysosceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length.
443800	447900	Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings,
447900	455800	but they are believed to be capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to or exceeding the performance attributed to types A and C.
455800	462300	In the midst of a slew of anonymous triangular sightings with strange lights and fixtures in the 1980s and 1990s,
462300	467000	which we will discuss later, the 1989 Belgian UFO wave arose.
467000	472900	All too often associated with the Patrick M. Hoekst photograph are labeled a case of mass delusion.
472900	477800	The Belgian Triangle UFO wave has incredible amounts of worthwhile investigation.
477800	481800	The wave is not the subject of today's video, but let's briefly discuss.
481800	491200	In November of 1989, hundreds of reports surfaced from Belgium of a large, flat, triangular-shaped craft with lights underneath flying at low altitudes.
491200	494800	The event culminated on the night of March 30th, 1990,
494800	502700	where an unknown object was tracked by radar and pursued by two Belgian F-16 fighters who were unable to locate the triangle.
502800	508300	Internal DOD documents once classified revealed U.S. authorities investigated the case
508300	517400	and even confirmed to the Belgian Air Force and Ministry of Defense that no USAF stealth aircraft such as the B-2 or F-117 were used in the region.
517400	522700	But what if this wave of sightings strangely caught on radar on March 30th, 1990
522700	530600	was a series of tests over an allied nation of a stealth craft even more secret than the B-2 and F-117?
530700	536200	What if this aircraft program was deep-sixed and embedded within special-access programs,
536200	542400	within reach of only those with need-to-know access in the highest clearances the US had to offer?
542400	547900	What if this craft was the TR-3B reverse-engineered triangle?
553000	558800	In at least three of my projects, I have mentioned the testimony of USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet
558800	564100	and his claims of anti-gravity reverse-engineered triangular craft called TR-3B.
564100	569700	Black budget operations involving Nellis-slash-Area-51 and Edwards Air Force Base,
569700	575900	an involvement of contractors such as Lockheed Martin in non-human intelligence technology exploitation.
575900	580400	Well, now is finally the time to explore his entire testimony.
580400	584700	Edgar Albert Fouchet, sometimes referred to as Edgar Rothschild Fouchet,
584700	590000	was born in 1948 in South Central Georgia to fifth-generation Americans.
590000	596300	His family history consisted of numerous individuals in military intelligence and classified projects.
596300	601600	During the Vietnam conflict while attending college, Fouchet worked as a machinist making bombs.
601600	606900	In 1968, the young man was drafted into USAF for para-rescue basic training.
606900	612200	After fracturing his ankle at Fort Benning, Edgar completed training in electronics, communication,
612300	614900	intelligence, and cryptological methods.
614900	621000	From 64 to 74, Fouchet was stationed at myriad tactical air command and air training command bases,
621000	625900	including 3.5 years stationed in Vietnam and surrounding Asian bases.
625900	630200	Within USAF, Fouchet earned degrees in electronics and avionics engineering,
630200	635800	as well as a bachelor's in business and enjoyed numerous awards and a prestigious reputation
635800	639800	for his advanced skillset often sought after by military brass.
639800	644500	In the late 1970s, Fouchet would see a series of USAF-mandated stations
644500	651600	at the now infamous Groom Lake Area 51 facility with a top-secret clearance with crypto access.
651600	656700	Fouchet was considered an Air Force expert with classified electronic countermeasure test equipment,
656700	660100	cryptological test equipment, and automatic test equipment.
660100	665400	All while receiving around 4,000 hours of technical training from USG and DOD,
665400	667400	half of which was classified.
667400	672200	Late in his career working eight years as a defense contractor and engineering manager,
672200	676600	Fouchet dealt with classified black programs developing state-of-the-art electronics,
676600	680400	logistics, and technical data and automatic testing equipment.
680400	685200	The master sergeant participated as a hand-picked key member to work on USAF fighters
685200	692100	such as the F-15 Eagle Air Superiority Fighter, the A-10 Warthog, the P-1 Lancer Bomber,
692100	694800	and the F-117A stealth fighter.
694800	700200	Fouchet claimed to have worked alongside the Defense Advanced Research Center in 1979,
700200	706100	which he stated was a minimum 10-story underground facility between Area 51 Groom Lake.
706100	711600	Fouchet was recruited to Groom Lake out of his station at Edwards Air Force Base Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
711600	715500	which he claimed also consisted of deep underground facilities.
715500	719900	The Defense Advanced Research Center, DARCE, not to be confused with DARPA,
719900	725200	the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency was actually a proposed institution.
725200	729700	Let's reference this declassified Advanced Project Research Agency, DARPA,
729700	733400	a lot of acronyms I know, study written in 1973.
733400	739100	This study was written as a historical evaluation of the R&D Management Institution, DARPA,
739100	745200	who at this time had established remarkably little in the way of official record or institutional memory.
745300	750900	On page 82 of the document under DARPA Laboratories discussing advanced aerospace projects,
750900	755100	we find a DOD directive showing the Army Ballistic Missile Agency
755100	759500	was considered for transfer into the Defense Advanced Research Center,
759500	763500	linking the department to the aforementioned Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
763500	769200	And it is worth noting the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was commanded by Nazi V-2 rocket scientist
769200	772600	and Operation Paperclip transfer, Werner von Braun.
772600	776300	Von Braun's mentor was father of German rocketry Hermann Oberth,
776300	779400	who performed extensive study on UFOs.
779400	784200	But back to Fuchet, it was here at DARCE he would work with advanced digital technologies
784200	787700	and gain knowledge of human-made reverse engineered craft.
792700	797800	Master Sergeant Edgar Fuchet made his first public disclosures regarding reverse engineered
797900	804600	anti-gravity triangular craft called TR-3B in his 1998 book, Alien Rapture,
804600	809300	and presented this data for MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network in IUFO-C,
809300	814700	the International UFO Congress after years of interviews, research, and preparation.
814700	819900	These disclosures were sourced from five close friends within DOD and classified programs,
819900	825100	as well as Fuchet's first-hand experience at Area 51 Groom Lake in the DARC.
825100	829600	We will focus mostly on his 1998 IUFO-C presentation,
829600	834700	as it serves as an extremely comprehensive baseline summary of Fuchet's testimony,
834700	840100	while also pulling clips and contextually relevant data from other sources and Fuchet interviews.
840100	845100	His book, Alien Rapture, is extremely similar to Secret Machines by Tom DeLonge,
845100	852300	where alleged non-fiction events are shrouded in a guise of fiction to protect names, dates, and locations.
852300	857200	Fuchet's 1998 testimony revolved around the revelations of secret government technology
857200	860400	and reverse engineered extraterrestrial artifacts.
860400	868000	Edgar set out with the specific goal of informing the public on the facts behind the infamously-cited flying triangles.
868000	870800	Before I'm through, you'll know exactly what the flying triangle is,
870800	873200	the one that's been sighted around the world.
873200	879200	It's the most exotic and classified aerospace vehicle that's ever been built,
879200	885300	and maybe stealthily hovering over Phoenix, Belgium, or your city.
885300	889500	And we must note, outside of his own personal sightings of the craft while in service,
889500	892500	Fuchet did not work on the TR-3B.
892500	897600	He relayed much of the data he gathered around the TR-3B from his five close sources.
897600	903700	Let's discuss these five close sources who build much of the foundation for Fuchet's disclosures.
903700	910600	Edgar's closest ally was Gerald, a former National Security Agency investigator and TREAT team member.
910600	914800	TREAT stands for the Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team,
914800	918300	a.k.a. what we might call the Men in Black.
918300	922600	I can find only one publicly available mention of TREAT,
922600	926300	and this is from Lichtenstein's Crown Prince Hans Adams
926300	931500	in a letter to Dr. Stephen Greer dated August 31, 1997.
931500	939400	This letter from an unknown sender discusses Hans Adams in his mention in a book by author Tom Bowers called Nazi Gold.
939400	945600	Hans had previously spoken and collaborated with Greer on UAP issues to an unknown degree.
945600	950400	This sender accused the Crown Prince of having supported counterintelligence operations
950400	953700	against the American people on the subject of UFOs,
953700	959000	and in this letter, the sender directly accused Hans Adams of funding TREAT.
959800	964300	Adams' funding should be focused on his support for TREAT and its Grand Dom,
964300	971300	who is wed to a former U.S. Army General, ex-head of Army Intelligence and Security Command, end quote.
971300	977700	The general in question here is U.S. Army General and founder of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command,
977700	980400	INSCOM, Albert Stubblebein.
980400	986700	Now, I have good reason to believe Army INSCOM is likely associated with UFO crash retrievals,
986700	989400	but we will discuss this in a future project.
989400	997300	Major General Albert Stubblebein himself allegedly intimidated Stephen Greer to discontinue investigating UFO Black projects.
997300	1000200	And the level of corruption is worrisome.
1000200	1013000	Now, in 92, General Albert Stubblebein III, Bert, who had been head of Special Forces and Army Intelligence, Fort Wachuka,
1013000	1021300	he intercepted me after we had this major contact event out in Florida and near Pensacola.
1021300	1031400	And he subsequently, about a month later, personally offered me $2 billion to not pursue what I was doing and become part of his team.
1031400	1037200	And Stubblebein is currently witness 10658 in Greer's witness log.
1037200	1044600	His witness description reads, quote, has been involved since the 1960s, former head of Fort Wachuka Army Intelligence,
1044600	1048300	where ET craft and bodies are stored, end quote.
1048300	1055600	What we can learn here is that quite possibly, TREAT is the real life men in black housed within U.S. Army INSCOM.
1055600	1061200	OK, but back to Fouchet and the first of the five disclosure advocates and team members, Gerald.
1061200	1067000	TREAT stands for Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team.
1067000	1069700	I think some of you call me in in black.
1069700	1073900	They work for the Department of Energy and the National Security Agency.
1073900	1082700	This was his cover, but ultimately the National Security Agency controlled all his movements and everything he did.
1082700	1090500	His job required him to watch employees with top secret and cue clearances and other classified clearances at the Nevada Test Site,
1090500	1096800	the Nellis Range, Los Alamos, Sandia, and many other bases.
1096800	1102600	He spent a lot of time out at Area 51 for years before I even knew what he was involved in.
1102600	1108400	This where the previously the most classified aerospace testing in the world took place.
1108400	1115600	You may know it as Groom Lake, Watertown, the Ranch, or Greenland.
1115600	1118900	He was found dead of a heart attack a year after our last meeting.
1118900	1127600	The second individual, Sal, worked directly with the National Security Agency with Electronics Intelligence and became a defense contractor upon his retirement.
1127600	1135500	Sal worked for the company that created the TR-3B gravity disruption device called the Magnetic Field Disruptor, more on this later.
1135500	1142700	The third friend, Doc, was an SR-71 spy plane pilot and USAF test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base.
1142700	1152900	Those who have watched my reverse engineering project at Edwards video will immediately recognize the importance of Edwards and the 412th test group comprising the Edwards test pilot school.
1152900	1157700	If you haven't, I recommend watching that, but we'll explain more during Fouché's testimony.
1157700	1161000	The fourth friend, Dell, served with Fouché during Vietnam.
1161000	1167800	Dell's father worked for the NSA for over 25 years and sent Fouché a host of Majestic 12 documents.
1167800	1177100	The fifth member, Rand Budd, was a DOD contractor electronics engineer who worked on top secret R&D programs with electronic countermeasures.
1177100	1187800	The men were perturbed by the fact each had been privy to unusual phenomena, extremely advanced technology, and unidentified aerial vehicles that had not been reported.
1187800	1202800	As we sat at a table in a dark corner of the Silver Dollar Saloon in Las Vegas, discussing our experiences and swapping knowledge, each of the group of five assured me that they trusted me enough to write about their secrets and protect them.
1202800	1211500	We agreed to get together the next year with an understanding that I would contact each of them and set up the meeting.
1211500	1221800	In the meantime, I wrote down all of our notes and their input and their context from other friends about unusual phenomena and their personal sightings.
1221800	1228500	Many of the things the group revealed to me were startling, even to me who had worked 25 years on black programs.
1228500	1235000	But before we continue, let's walk things back and get to know Fouché and his station in black programs a little bit better.
1235000	1245100	In 1979, after working at Nellis with top secret crypto access clearance, Fouché received a request for temporary reassignment to a place with no name.
1245100	1252200	Fouché's commanding officer had no idea where he was going, who he would be working with, or what he would be working on.
1252200	1259900	And while we're here, let's take a longer look at this document obtained via FOIA, discussing a promotional recommendation for Fouché.
1259900	1271800	Fouché was assigned to Detachment 3, AFFTC, which is the Air Force Flight Test Center Detachment from Edwards Air Force Base that runs operations at Area 51 Groom Lake.
1271800	1283000	Remember how witness Ed stated he was read into UAP programs at Nellis and Area 51 S4 before moving on to become a test director of reverse engineered craft at Edwards.
1283000	1289900	Edgar left on a Monday morning at 4.30 a.m. and boarded a dark blue USAF bus with blacked out windows.
1289900	1294400	28 other people sat on the bus, not including two security policemen.
1294400	1297900	All personnel were ordered not to speak to one another.
1297900	1305000	After several hours, the bus came to rest and Fouché knew immediately where he was, Groom Lake, Area 51.
1305000	1315900	According to the Master Sergeant, the top secret SR-75, SR-74, and TR-3B operated out of Groom Lake and have historically been misidentified as UFOs.
1315900	1320100	Upon reaching Groom Lake, the bus entered a hangar and the doors were shut.
1320100	1323100	Security personnel checked in Fouché and the others.
1323100	1331900	He was given a pair of heavy glasses, similar to welder's goggles, that obscured his peripheral vision and restricted vision to within 30 feet.
1332000	1337200	For the next 10 consecutive days and further on follow-up visits, Fouché's routine was the same.
1337200	1341400	Leave Nellis before sunrise and return to Nellis after dark.
1341400	1350300	Fouché would write down everything he saw and heard at Groom Lake, including hearing topics discussed such as pulse detonation, cyclotronic radiation,
1350300	1357100	quantum flux, transduction field generators, quasi-crystal energy lenses, and EPR quantum receivers.
1357100	1365000	Pulse detonation may remind you of the Aurora Pulsar craft seen by Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Show.
1365000	1370000	I'm not going to talk about quasi-crystals. I'll make a prediction.
1370000	1375600	Quasi-crystals is the key to everything you want to ever know about how they got here.
1375600	1382600	That's all I'm going to say about it now, except one of the quasi-crystals is the hydrogen crystal.
1382700	1389200	His station at Groom Lake is also where Fouché would meet TREAT, aka Men in Black Agent, Gerald.
1389200	1398500	According to Fouché, on Area 51 is the super-secret laboratory named the Defense Advanced Research Center, of which we can only find one official mention.
1398500	1406800	DARS consists of 10 underground stories next to a mountain near Papouse Lake south of Groom Lake and is nestled next to a hangar in the side of a mountain,
1406800	1410300	which stores the TR-3B reverse-engineered craft.
1410300	1419400	The DARS's objectives were fully realized in the mid-1980s, according to Fouché, when it was bolstered with SDI money under the Reagan administration.
1419400	1428000	Viewers of my channel will recall multiple times in which I have discussed sources commenting on the Strategic Defense Initiative SDI under Reagan,
1428000	1432600	serving a secondary purpose to protect the U.S. mainland from ballistic missiles.
1432600	1438700	This secondary purpose being the detection of and offensive capabilities against UAP.
1438700	1448100	Fouché claimed his sources estimated up to 35% of SDI's funding was siphoned off to support USAF Black Program starting in 1982.
1448100	1452900	First-hand ARV witness Brad Sorensen was additionally told in 1988,
1452900	1459000	by the men in charge of the ARV exhibit, they were requesting funding to build more of these reverse-engineered craft.
1459000	1463900	The Reagan admin placed extreme importance on the building of ARVs.
1463900	1471100	Shockingly, Fouché stated Defense Contractor EG&G not only provided classified R&D for Black projects,
1471100	1477900	technical and scientific support for nuclear and energy R&D, but also EG&G built these hidden bunkers,
1477900	1481800	mountain hangars, and vast underground facilities at Groom Lake,
1481800	1486000	Papouse, and Mercury for the government, housing facilities such as DARS.
1486000	1493200	The mention of these facilities ties into the topic of DUMMS, deep underground military bases, which I will explore in the future.
1493200	1498200	Alongside EG&G, the RAND Corporation more than likely has a hand here.
1498200	1507500	Edgar would also claim he gathered knowledge EG&G was awarded an indefinite contract for Project Red Light to support the Department of Energy and Military.
1507500	1513900	This contract gave them responsibility to assist in the recovery of nuclear materials in cases of mishaps
1513900	1519200	and to provide aerial and ground security for highly classified government and military sites.
1519200	1524200	One's mind may be drawn here to the Nuclear Emergency Support Team supported by EG&G,
1524200	1535000	but Project Red Light was also relayed to Leonard Stringfield in his crash retrieval status reports by a witness claiming the project served to test NHI and reverse engineered craft
1535000	1540000	on the Nellis test range after the craft had been shipped from Edwards Air Force Base.
1540000	1548900	Sources of the Master Sergeant claimed as of 1992 the Air Force conducted a contingency plan due to so many public eyes on Area 51.
1548900	1560900	This would see the majority of exotic aircraft platforms relocated to Utah, likely Dugway Proving Grounds, Colorado, Alaska, Greenland, Diego Garcia and south of Area 51 to S-4.
1560900	1569900	But at Papoose where they store one of the TR-3Bs and they maintain these as their depot, it's built into the side of a mountain cut out of stone.
1569900	1578800	They have a holographic generator that generates the side of the mountain and when you're 10 feet from the side of this mountain and looking into the hangar you can always see a mountain.
1578800	1590800	And that's why when the Russian satellites fly over to verify the salt treaty, when they're infrared and other spectral scanners shoot down at groom, they only see stone because that's all that's there.
1590800	1601800	Just before the state of 1992, there is strangely enough evidence to show a heavy focus on strange exotic aircraft programs out of Area 51, possibly UFO related.
1601800	1613800	In 1990, James defense writer James Goodall revealed a thesis of at least eight black programs flying out of Area 51 Groom Lake including a silent triangle utilizing unconventional technologies.
1613800	1622800	A source Goodall knew for 12 years was stationed at Groom Lake and explained that UAP positively exist at the base while another source of his stated quote,
1622800	1640800	we have things out there that are literally out of this world, better than Star Trek or anything you can see in the movies and quote, and now we finally get into a full body description of the TR-3B craft.
1640800	1645800	Finally, I've saved the best for last, the operational model of the TR-3B.
1645800	1659800	A friend of mine said he had never forget the sight of the alien looking TR-3B landing at Papu's south of Groom. The pitch black triangular shaped TR-3B is rarely mentioned and then only in whispers.
1659800	1678800	This craft, the most classified aerospace development program in existence at the time, codename Astra, advanced stealth technology reconnaissance aircraft, saw 200 feet diameter testing models and three and 600 feet diameter operational models.
1678800	1693800	The tactical reconnaissance TR-3B operated as the most exotic model under the Aurora program, according to Fouché, the same program umbrella that oversaw the pulse detonation UAV Pulsar craft observed by Brad Sorensen.
1693800	1699800	And we may have some clues regarding this family of Aurora craft in previous DoD budgets.
1699800	1711800	In DoD procurement programs, we can find an Aurora project the DoD planned to spend $80 million on in fiscal year 86 and $2.3 billion on in fiscal year 87.
1711800	1719800	This 25 times increase in spending is enormous and at the time was double the cost of the B2 Spirit Bomber program.
1719800	1737800	The Aurora program may have included the reverse engineered TR-3B Lockheed Pulsar as seen by Sorensen and a little known craft titled the SR-33A introduced by Dr. Michael Wolfe, an alleged UAP consultant to the National Security Council special subcommittee.
1737800	1747800	Similar to TR-3B and Pulsar, the SR-33A allegedly utilized conventional fuel and anti-gravity field propulsion systems to operate under a secret space program.
1747800	1756800	The first flight ready operational model of TR-3B occurred in the early 1990s built through SDI and black budget monies.
1756800	1762800	By 1994, at least three of the billion dollar plus operational models were flying.
1762800	1769800	But Fouchet had seen the prototype model or a different model three times previously far before 1994.
1769800	1777800	And according to his sources, there were numerous prototypes with the first anti-gravity warping craft flying in the early 1970s.
1777800	1800800	Not only did he claim to have seen photographs of TR-3B from a C-130 flying mission support for the reverse engineered craft, but Fouchet also claimed to have observed the triangles one night in 1975 high in the atmosphere over Edwards Air Force Base as well as 1976 within the southern part of Nellis Range and lastly in 1979 at Groom Lake.
1800800	1808800	This prototype model looked fairly similar to Fouchet's official model, but with different engines on the tip and no rotable crew compartment.
1808800	1814800	I do recommend checking out part six of author Andrew Johnson's interviews with Fouchet to hear more about his sightings.
1814800	1817800	For the interest of time, I will not show these long clips here.
1817800	1829800	But let's hear about more aspects of the TR-3B Fouchet learned from sources within black programs and his five disclosure comrades and then discuss how the propulsion and engineering system allegedly functioned.
1829800	1842800	According to these sources, the original TR-3B craft design was reverse engineered by Sandia National Labs in Livermore laboratories from a non-human intelligence crash recovery from an unknown date or location.
1842800	1852800	Sandia may be familiar to some as the laboratory nestled within Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico has been often historically implicated with UFO material recovery.
1853800	1861800	Seeing numerous mentions within the MJ-12 documents such as the Eisenhower briefing document and interplanetary phenomenon unit reports.
1861800	1875800	Livermore Labs now called Lawrence Livermore is one of three national security enterprise FFRDCs, federally funded research and development centers sponsored by the DOE to support U.S. nuclear deterrence.
1875800	1880800	The other two locations are Los Alamos National Labs and of course, Sandia.
1880800	1898800	I myself have been told alongside UARC's university affiliated research centers, FFRDCs are semi-private institutions that serve to operate alongside DOD and corporate legacy programs for material exploitation, reverse engineering, etc.
1898800	1912800	Other FFRDCs include Oak Ridge National Laboratory owned by Battelle where our good friend Sean Kirkpatrick ran off to after Aero as well as numerous institutions run by the MITRE Corporation and RAND Corporation.
1912800	1921800	MITRE and RAND will receive their own projects in the near future as I believe these semi-private institutions are integral corporations involved in legacy programs.
1921800	1927800	Those unfamiliar with UARC just need to look back at my work on the 1965 Kecksburg crash.
1927800	1934800	Dr. Eric A. Walker, president of Penn State, self-admitted he oversaw the Kecksburg crash site.
1934800	1941800	Walker had also previously set up Penn State's UARC, the Applied Research Laboratory at the behest of the U.S. Navy.
1941800	1955800	And let's not forget, as of 2024, the untrustworthy Aero under new leadership of Dr. Koslowski admitted Aero, a likely whistleblower honeypot with contracts with Sandcorp, a company built to prevent whistleblower leaks.
1955800	1960800	Stated Aero works alongside UARC and FFRDC.
1960800	1971800	Sure, right now, most of our collaborations that are bearing towards academia are with UARC, university-affiliated research centers associated with universities or with FFRDCs.
1971800	1979800	All this is to say, Fuchet's accusations that Sandia and Lawrence reverse-engineered NHI craft is a sober and rational statement.
1979800	1996800	Edgar would also state the TR3B program was managed by the NRO, CIA, and NSA, and the craft was built primarily by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne, Ryan, and a number of other defense contractors to keep R&D compartmentalized.
1996800	1999800	There is a lot to break down here.
1999800	2014800	One, due to the excellent work of Chris Sharp and an upcoming interview that I have with Dr. Eric Davis, yes, of the Wilson Davis memo, we can implicate the CIA directorate of science and technology with support agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office,
2014800	2025800	National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and likely the National Security Agency as leading teams behind UFO crash retrievals.
2025800	2029800	Fuchet mentioning Lockheed Martin needs no further explanation.
2029800	2035800	I do recommend checking out both my Mark McCandless video and Lockheed Martin investigation. Find them in the video description.
2035800	2038800	Now, Boeing is indeed an interesting mention.
2038800	2048800	Director of Edward's 412th Electronic Warfare Group, ED, stated he worked alongside Boeing and Lockheed on reverse-engineered craft systems at the Nellis Range.
2048800	2056800	Boeing will additionally receive a video of its own, but for now let's reference a fascinating 2013 project by stealth aircraft researcher John Joseph.
2056800	2070800	Joseph claims Boeing served as the primary contractor in Project Brilliant, an SDI program with the goal of setting up an electromagnetic shield around the U.S. using a boomerang-shaped craft that could loiter over cities.
2070800	2077800	Northrop Grumman has as much as Lockheed Martin been historically implicated with the creation of TR-3B.
2077800	2084800	Let's hold off on discussing them for now, as later I would like to tackle a possible triangle variant constructed by Northrop Grumman.
2084800	2092800	Fuchet knew the TR-3B housed a crew of four and served as logistics support and transport for a secret space command.
2092800	2099800	These pilots were top graduates of Navy and USAF test pilot schools, mainly out of the Edwards 412th Test School.
2099800	2103800	Edwards Witness ED additionally made these same claims.
2103800	2114800	The craft employed two nuclear reactors, was comprised of advanced composites, metal materials, and titanium, and employed variable-vectored intake and thrusters on the edges,
2114800	2118800	and advanced multi-mode propulsion engines on each tip of the triangle.
2118800	2128800	The triangle has three lights on each tip, a large diffuse light on the bottom center due to the MFD drive, and featured almost no sound but a magnetic humming.
2128800	2135800	The TR-3B outer coating was reactive to electrical radar stimulation and can change reflectiveness radar absorption.
2135800	2144800	Fuchet described the outer skin-slash panels as electrochromatic, which would camouflage the craft for daytime stealth operations.
2144800	2148800	But let's further dive into the propulsion system from Edgar's own words.
2149800	2155800	The circular plasma-filled accelerator ring, called the Magnetic Field Disruptor, surrounds a rotatable crew compartment.
2155800	2159800	It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology.
2159800	2168800	Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed a reverse-engineered MFD, and I believe the government will go at any lengths to protect this technology.
2168800	2172800	But you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you. Nor am I.
2172800	2175800	The government will go at any lengths.
2175800	2179800	Believe me, the plasma in this accelerator is mercury-based.
2179800	2194800	It's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin, superconductivity, and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute to create a superconductive plasma with a resulting gravity energy.
2195800	2204800	The MFD generates a magnetic vortex field, which disrupts and neutralizes the effects of gravity on mass within proximity by 89%.
2204800	2211800	Do not misunderstand. This is not anti-gravity. Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force.
2211800	2221800	The mass of the circular accelerator and all the mass within the accelerator, such as the crew compartment, avionics, MFD systems, fuels, environmental systems,
2221800	2225800	and nuclear reactor are reduced by 89%.
2225800	2237800	This causes the effect of making an aircraft extremely light and able to outperform any aircraft yet constructed, except, of course, those we didn't build.
2237800	2244800	TR-3B is a high-altitude stealth reconnaissance platform with indefinite loader time.
2244800	2251800	Once you get it up there at speed, it doesn't take much propulsion to maintain altitude.
2251800	2258800	With the vehicle's mass reduced by 89%, the vehicle can travel at Mach 9 vertically or horizontally.
2258800	2265800	So for those that have had sightings of things making right, and they're not perfect right turns, obviously, nothing can make a perfect right turn.
2265800	2270800	It's against the laws of physics, but it sure looks like a right turn at a distance.
2270800	2273800	For those that have seen it, that's how they do it.
2273800	2280800	TR-3B uses three multi-mode thrusters mounted on each corner of the triangular platform.
2280800	2286800	The multi-mode propulsion system can operate in the atmosphere with thrust provided by the nuclear reactor,
2286800	2292800	and in the upper atmosphere with hydrogen and propulsion, and in orbit with combined hydrogen and oxygen propulsion.
2292800	2304800	A key component of TR-3B propulsion as described by Fouchet states its MFD technology built from reversed engineered UAP is not anti-gravity necessarily.
2304800	2309800	Anti-gravity by definition provides a propulsive force that can be used for propulsion.
2309800	2317800	MFD creates a quote-unquote disruption of the Earth's gravitational field upon the mass within the circular accelerator.
2317800	2324800	Such systems leveraged from non-human technology may indeed be present and highly secret but acknowledged to aircraft systems.
2324800	2328800	One such example may be the Northrop Grumman B-2 stealth bomber.
2328800	2335800	UFO researchers such as Dr. Richard Boylan have reported three star generals and retired USAF Colonel Donald Ware
2335800	2343800	have disclosed the B-2 carry's onboard electro-gravitic systems to cause internal mass reduction on the wings and fuselage of the craft,
2343800	2348800	which directly leads to the over $1 billion price tag for each craft.
2348800	2353800	The question is, and Mark talked about this before, is there more going on to the B-2 than meets the eye?
2353800	2364800	Aviation Week Space Technology March 9, 1992 had a very interesting article from people who worked at Northrop
2364800	2372800	who were very upset that the technology associated with the B-2 program was not being trickled down to the public industry.
2372800	2379800	They talk about how the B-2 electrically charges the leading edge of the wing to reduce the radar cross-signature,
2379800	2385800	that's what you see in this diagram right here, and then negatively charges the exhaust gases to reduce the infrared signature.
2385800	2392800	This is the same type of electro-gravitic technology that T-Towns and Brown had originally proposed in the 1930s,
2392800	2397800	so this technology might date back a lot earlier than we originally thought.
2397800	2404800	And before we move on, remember earlier when Edgar Fouchet mentioned ASTRA, Advanced Stealth Technology Reconnaissance Aircraft,
2404800	2411800	served as the codename for TR-3B? Well, we may in fact have a crash retrieval of this craft.
2411800	2419800	In Ryan Wood's masterpiece Magic Eyes Only, we can find a case dated September 26, 1994 from Bosscom Down, England.
2419800	2425800	This case file references a publication from the November 1994 edition of Air Force Monthly,
2425800	2432800	which discusses an unusual crash landing on the runway of the UK government's highly secret Bosscom Down facility.
2432800	2439800	Rumors quickly circulated the crash was of a flying triangle seen by UFO witnesses for decades.
2439800	2442800	The Air Force Monthly article reads,
2442800	2450800	Shortly after the crash, an unmarked civilian registered CIA operated, Boeing 737 and a similarly anonymous DC-8,
2450800	2459800	visited and two days later the wreck was loaded onto a CC-5 Galaxy and flown to Air Force Plant 42 at Palmdale, California.
2459800	2465800	The secrecy surrounding the incident has led to speculation that the aircraft involved was a TR-3A,
2465800	2471800	the existence of which the US government has yet to officially acknowledge.
2471800	2478800	While this publication mentions the crash of a TR-3A, and Fuchet does indeed state the TR-3A exists,
2478800	2483800	but is remarkably different from TR-3B, it's worth noting quite often in the public realm,
2483800	2491800	TR-3A and TR-3B are often used almost interchangeably, so perhaps this crash case is referencing TR-3B.
2491800	2497800	And this distinction is key to explore further, as terminology around TR-3A is quite confusing.
2497800	2504800	Quite often I have seen the TR-3A referred to as the pumpkin seed, a craft utilizing pulse detonation engines,
2504800	2509800	the same unmanned craft Brad Sorensen saw in 1988.
2509800	2514800	While other sources refer to TR-3A as a delta-shaped fighter featuring a cockpit,
2514800	2521800	pulse detonation engines, and electro-gravitics for internal mass reduction are complementary field propulsion for high speeds.
2521800	2529800	But while exploring this A and B distinction under co-name Astra, there is a fascinating tangent I want to cover.
2529800	2534800	Let's reference Secret Machines by Tom DeLonge and A.J. Hartley,
2534800	2540800	an extremely famous science fiction novel in the UFO community that fuses the imagination of DeLonge
2540800	2544800	with actual events obtained from U.S. military and government sources,
2544800	2548800	a literary device known as a Romana clay.
2548800	2556800	Facts in this book were allegedly given to DeLonge by advisors such as the commander of the Air Force Research Lab at Wright Patterson Air Force Base,
2556800	2561800	multiple Lockheed Martin Skunkworks officials such as Eric Schrock and others.
2561800	2568800	This excellent book makes numerous mentions to an astro-black triangle reverse engineered craft, quote,
2568800	2573800	The craft itself, according to its data manual, was triangular and was named the Astra-3B,
2573800	2577800	but we just call it the Locust, said Beaker with a smile.
2577800	2584800	He was proud to be connected to it. The Locust had control layouts unlike those used in any aircraft he had ever seen.
2584800	2592800	Controls that were not just familiar, but counter-intuitive to anyone with a basic sense of aviation or aerospace physics, end quote.
2592800	2597800	But what I really want to draw attention to here is the description of the Astra's control mechanism.
2597800	2605800	When characters in the film operate the Astra-3B Locust, the pilot's chair looked disappointingly like that from an F-16,
2605800	2611800	but on the left armrest of the pilot's seat sat a red sphere sitting in a cradle, quote,
2611800	2617800	Alan turned the sphere under his hand and the craft rotated cleanly, too cleanly in the air.
2617800	2624800	He then applied a little thrust and was moving. The landmarks of Paris, including the Eiffel Tower, zipping past them in a blur.
2624800	2628800	He pursed his lips. State of the art it may be, but it didn't feel like flight.
2628800	2632800	No aircraft could pivot on a dime like he had just done, end quote.
2632800	2633800	Quote.
2633800	2637800	He engaged the manual system and cupped his hand over the red trackball on his armrest.
2637800	2641800	He rolled it gently in the Locust pivoted in place. Quote.
2641800	2646800	He engaged the manual system and cupped his hand over the red trackball on the armrest.
2646800	2649800	He rolled it gently in the Locust pivoted in place.
2649800	2654800	He did it again, applying a little thrust with his other hand, and the ship changed direction again,
2654800	2660800	leaping hard to the west and then climbing in a dizzying spiral before screaming back to the southeast.
2660800	2664800	Of course, there was no screaming, except perhaps inside Alan's head,
2664800	2668800	as the laws of physics seemed to implode with each movement the craft made.
2668800	2673800	No sound, no torque, no g-force, no inertia, end quote.
2673800	2678800	Now, of course, this passage material is interesting, but why do I bring this up?
2678800	2682800	Well, because the control scheme in this is the exact same sphere mechanism
2682800	2686800	primary witness Brad Sorenson and aerospace illustrator Mark McCandless
2686800	2690800	claimed the alien reproduction vehicle Fluxliners utilized.
2690800	2695800	See on screen Mark McCandless's drawing of the trackball used to control the flying saucer.
2695800	2701800	Countless comparisons to the 1988 saucer ARV encounter have been made so far in this project.
2701800	2706800	Perhaps the Fluxliner and TR-3B are born of the same programs.
2711800	2715800	With disclosures as impactful and spellbinding as Fuchet's,
2715800	2718800	his story attracted a great deal of attention and controversy.
2718800	2725800	So, I'd briefly like to mention the contentious arguments that waged war against Fuchet in the early and mid-2010s.
2725800	2729800	This controversy is quite complex, and I have zero skin in this game,
2729800	2734800	so we will simply try and analyze the statements made criticizing and supporting Fuchet
2734800	2736800	in the story of the TR-3B.
2736800	2738800	Let us draw out a few key players here.
2738800	2741800	Jeremy Rice, aka Alien Scientist.
2741800	2745800	David Hamilton, author of Secret Space Program, Andrew Johnson.
2745800	2749800	UFO researcher Dan Benkert and Master Sergeant Fuchet himself.
2749800	2755800	On his website, AlienScientist.com, Jeremy Rice posted some startling opinions on Fuchet
2755800	2760800	after discussing Edgar's autobiography and very real military documents.
2760800	2763800	Jeremy stated the TR-3B testimony was, quote,
2763800	2767800	information that has no technical value and was likely fabricated by Ed
2767800	2774800	in an effort to combine stories about the Nazi Bell device with the Belgian wave of triangular UFO sightings.
2774800	2779800	So that his story would be more believable to the UFO research community, end quote.
2779800	2785800	This claim was based off criticism of Ed stating the TR-3B utilized mercury-based plasma systems
2785800	2789800	alongside strong opinions after years of friendship with the Master Sergeant.
2789800	2796800	After meeting Edgar in 2009, Jeremy would view the veteran as a close friend and legitimate whistleblower for years, quote.
2796800	2799800	After having known Edgar Fuchet for the past four years,
2799800	2805800	I must say that he is one of the most deceitful and manipulative people that I have ever met personally, end quote.
2805800	2810800	Jeremy would accuse this behavior as stemming from PTSD-driven rampant alcoholism.
2810800	2816800	Jeremy would even state Edgar claimed to have flown a TR-3B one night whilst intoxicated, however.
2816800	2819800	He provides no evidence or receipts of this statement.
2819800	2824800	Author Andrew Johnson, who conducted numerous interviews with Fuchet and formed a close friendship on the contrary,
2824800	2826800	spoke very highly of the man.
2826800	2831800	Positions against Edgar from Jeremy Rice and an individual known as David Hamilton
2831800	2837800	crutch on a few key points outside of what Jeremy viewed as a lack of compelling physics behind the TR-3B.
2837800	2842800	Faked military documents and a photo of the F-117A stealth fighter.
2842800	2848800	On an undisclosed date, Edgar sent Jeremy an image alleging to picture Fuchet alongside a crew
2848800	2854800	observing the F-117 prototype at Area 51 between 1977 and 1981.
2854800	2859800	Rice claimed Ed stole the photo from an article titled F-117A Senior Trend.
2859800	2862800	The photographer of this image would even respond, quote,
2862800	2868800	I cannot tell you who is in that photo, but I can tell you that Mr. Fuchet doesn't know what he is talking about, end quote.
2868800	2873800	My issue here is actually Jeremy's initial emails to the photographer Dan.
2873800	2878800	Alien scientist's email was overwhelmingly charged with leading statements against Edgar,
2878800	2882800	providing links to his full disclosures on TR-3B while stating, quote,
2882800	2887800	Ed has constructed a series of lies around this picture being and stationed at Groom Lake.
2887800	2890800	Many of us do not believe Ed at all, end quote.
2890800	2895800	This is not how one elicits an unbiased and objective response.
2895800	2901800	In 2013, YouTuber David Hilton posted a video titled Edgar Fuchet, Fake Documents,
2901800	2904800	which saw subsequent videos posted by Jeremy.
2904800	2909800	It is worth noting both of these projects have been unlisted and removed from YouTube.
2909800	2914800	Whether this is due to walking back the statements or to prevent further controversy, I am not sure.
2914800	2919800	Hilton constructed a group email with Jeremy Rise, Dan B, and Andrew Johnson,
2919800	2924800	author of Secret Program and supporter of Fuchet after a series of extensive interviews with the witness,
2924800	2927800	to discuss the video allegedly exposing Fuchet.
2927800	2932800	Hilton stated, quote, after knowing Ed on a personal level since February of 2012,
2932800	2936800	it is my opinion that he made up slash lied about everything.
2936800	2940800	I've caught him in so many lies and contradictions that I can't keep up with them all.
2940800	2944800	It's not really something that can be completely hashed out in an email, end quote.
2944800	2949800	This statement is rather shocking to me as alongside historical documents provided by Fuchet,
2949800	2955800	numerous documents highlighting Fuchet's military service were pried from Foya by Hilton himself.
2955800	2959800	While we cannot view this video or further context of Hilton claiming Fuchet as a liar,
2959800	2964800	we can analyze Edgar's response on the Outpost Forum in July of 2014.
2964800	2968800	Here, Edgar addressed the points Hilton seemingly made in his video.
2968800	2975800	By his response and defense of the documents, it appears Hilton attempted to address only small inconsistencies within the documents,
2975800	2982800	such as small indentations, variable pressure on letters, physical degradation of source documents and copies.
2982800	2988800	Due to Hilton and Rise retracting their video, I must conclude they conceded these claims against Fuchet.
2988800	2995800	Hilton additionally made some startling comments to the aforementioned Dan B in a June 2012 Skype conversation.
2995800	2998800	Now, Dan B is not to be confused with Dan Burish.
2998800	3003800	This is UFO researcher Dan Benkert, who has co-authored excellent work with Michael Schrat.
3003800	3007800	Benkert has been a staunch reporter of Fuchet after knowing him personally
3007800	3013800	and once offered a fascinating and worthy counter-explanation to a March 19, 2016 article titled,
3013800	3017800	Edgar Fuchet's TR3B is most likely a hoax.
3017800	3022800	Anyways, speaking to Dan B, Hilton would make some extremely startling remarks such as,
3023800	3027800	Actually, I work for an agency that monitors things you shouldn't do.
3027800	3030800	Go ahead and tell people they won't believe you.
3030800	3033800	And I now control Ed, not you.
3033800	3035800	Funny how things work out, isn't it?
3035800	3038800	The exposure becomes a tool of control.
3043800	3050800	Historically, accounts of witnessing NHI craft or NHI crash retrievals contain uniform elements.
3050800	3055800	These craft and technologies of unknown origin seem almost perfect.
3055800	3060800	No seams, no rivets, no bolts, almost as if the craft are 3D printed.
3060800	3066800	Some of these craft feature entirely smooth bodies or what humans would describe as windows,
3066800	3070800	yet some of the craft often appear beautiful and perfect in appearance.
3070800	3074800	This is almost never seen in triangular craft sightings.
3074800	3076800	Let us analyze some of these cases.
3076800	3081800	They've been seen almost in every country by every possible culture.
3081800	3083800	So it's a worldwide phenomenon.
3083800	3088800	We've got a case over here of a red one with this exhaust port here.
3088800	3090800	We've got a case in Detroit.
3090800	3091800	We've got Belgium cases.
3091800	3097800	So a brief cross-section of these aircraft have been seen all around the world.
3097800	3104800	The primary features of these triangles, they usually have a white light on the corner of each of the triangle.
3104800	3107800	Some of these are between 200 and 300 feet across.
3107800	3111800	This mid-section is generally about 20 feet across.
3111800	3115800	And then there's always this interesting structural work on the bottom
3115800	3120800	and probably a red or amber light in the center of the bottom section of the craft.
3120800	3123800	That's kind of the overall view of what we see here.
3123800	3128800	Let's travel back to October 28, 1993 to Croton Falls, New York,
3128800	3134800	in the midst of the Hudson Valley UFO flap and analyze the testimony of Jim Cook.
3134800	3138800	Cook, a biomedical engineer, was driving to his Hudson River Valley home
3138800	3141800	when he encountered a truly bizarre craft.
3141800	3145800	Near the Croton Falls Reservoir, Cook spotted aircraft lights
3145800	3148800	approaching the water level dropping very fast.
3148800	3151800	The lights appeared to hover before blinking out.
3151800	3153800	Cook, walking out of his car to the shoreline,
3153800	3158800	spotted a triangular object hovering 200 feet away, 15 feet above the water.
3158800	3161800	Nine red lights appeared on the triangle side
3161800	3165800	and a red break of light from the underside began to probe the water.
3165800	3170800	Now let's move to the year 2000 in the town of St. Clair in southern Illinois
3170800	3175800	where numerous small-town residents and police officers reported a triangular-shaped craft.
3175800	3181800	In the early morning of January 5th, police officers reported a UFO near Scott Air Force Base.
3181800	3187800	The craft was massive on a elongated black triangle, roughly 75 feet long and 40 feet wide.
3187800	3192800	At each corner sat a bright white light underwaving in luminosity.
3192800	3197800	One smaller flashing red light sat just below the object's midline near the rear two lights.
3197800	3201800	The back of the object appeared rectangular and illuminated in white light.
3201800	3206800	Through the middle of the light running lengthwise was a band of multi-colored illumination.
3206800	3209800	It was stated there were no individual colored lights visible.
3209800	3213800	Rather, it appeared as a band of various colors which blended into each other.
3213800	3217800	A second police officer reported the object heading in a westerly direction,
3217800	3220800	matching the description of initial reports.
3220800	3227800	This officer, Martin, added he believed the object to be maybe 75 to 100 yards in width at an altitude of 1,000 feet.
3227800	3234800	The object was estimated to travel at a loitering speed of 15 miles per hour before accelerating to 100 miles per hour.
3234800	3239800	Let's also jump to Madison, Wisconsin on November 22nd, 1985,
3239800	3244800	where multiple eyewitnesses described a triangular, dull, roughly 40 foot across craft.
3244800	3249800	Excellent researcher Michael Schrat extracted a quote from one of the eyewitnesses
3249800	3252800	who stated the underside of the craft resembled, quote,
3252800	3258800	the back of a refrigerator, like a collection of condensation pipes that ran back and forth, end quote.
3258800	3262800	One can't help but wonder here if this craft scene was an alien reproduction triangle
3262800	3268800	utilizing prototype propulsion systems requiring a massive heat exchanger apparatus.
3268800	3275800	Similar oddities can be observed in the United Kingdom's infamous sighting by Colin Saunders in March of 1999.
3275800	3278800	Saunders and his family, upon driving home from dinner,
3278800	3284800	observed a 50 foot long triangular shaped craft that pitched up and down at roughly a 15 degree angle.
3284800	3288800	Colin claimed the craft bobbed as if it were submerged in water.
3288800	3292800	The exterior of the craft was described as a flowing liquid mercury,
3292800	3297800	which reminds me closely of Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan's UFO crash retrieval case,
3297800	3303800	in which Wagan observed a crashed UAP with skin described as the mother of pearl effect.
3303800	3308800	The top of the craft was not flat, but more angled with a strange raised pattern on top
3308800	3313800	Saunders believed to be some sort of docking mechanism with a larger craft.
3313800	3316800	And this same pattern existed on the underside of the craft.
3316800	3319800	Parasitic aircraft are not uncommon in human-made airplanes.
3319800	3327800	In fact, in the 1970s, Youssef proposed a Boeing 747 airborne aircraft carrier to house an array of fighter jets.
3327800	3332800	This sloping top also sounds very dissimilar from the TR-3B,
3332800	3336800	but may sound extremely similar to the craft we're about to discuss.
3336800	3341800	Analyzing the strange lights, fixtures, systems, and appearances of these triangles
3341800	3347800	seen throughout the 1980s to early 2000s, we must ask, were these craft human-made?
3347800	3351800	Were they prototypes or iterations of TR-3B?
3351800	3355800	Or were these all the result of separate legacy programs?
3355800	3359800	Or were these flying triangles somewhere in between?
3363800	3369800	This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.
3369800	3373800	Now, I know you don't believe that story, but just hear me out.
3373800	3376800	Now, Ellen's air base, the same base that we're at right now,
3376800	3380800	the same base that for some strange reason doesn't appear on your U.S. government map,
3380800	3384800	is supposedly one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.
3384800	3388800	Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs?
3388800	3392800	No. Planes built using UFO technology.
3392800	3396800	Fascinating lines of research fully independent of Huchet's TR-3B
3396800	3400800	leads to a very similar reverse-engineered triangular craft
3400800	3405800	known by disgruntled engineers as the XF-131 Super Sentinel.
3405800	3408800	Let's visit respected artist Bill McDonald,
3408800	3411800	an old-school freelance commercial illustrator,
3411800	3414800	concept designer, forensic reconstruction illustrator,
3414800	3417800	and current sworn law enforcement professional.
3417800	3420800	I have featured McDonald's work in multiple projects,
3420800	3424800	most notably his designs with Dr. Robert Wood of the extraterrestrial entities
3424800	3427800	known as EB-1 and EB-2,
3427800	3430800	described within the Majestic-12 Special Operations Manual,
3430800	3433800	as well as his fantastic work on the Roswell craft
3433800	3437800	and the 1976 Tehran-Iran UFO incident.
3437800	3441800	McDonald additionally featured in a fantastic four-part series
3441800	3445800	on Michael Schrat's YouTube channel titled Roswell Revisited.
3445800	3448800	I, myself, have had the pleasure of speaking with Mr. McDonald
3448800	3451800	and hold an extremely high opinion of him,
3451800	3455800	including speaking on the drawing and case we are about to discuss.
3455800	3459800	And here I present to you the beautiful piece titled
3459800	3462800	Tehachapi Triangle 1992.
3462800	3465800	McDonald met with four old engineers
3465800	3470800	at a denny's in Antelope Valley, California in the spring of 1992.
3470800	3474800	All four engineers, two from Northrop Grumman and two from Lockheed Martin,
3474800	3477800	were fed up with egregious security impositions
3477800	3479800	negatively impacting their lives.
3479800	3484800	All four engineers were subject to extreme project compartmentalization,
3484800	3486800	with each having a piece of the puzzle
3486800	3489800	for the name of the triangular craft Antelope Valley residents
3489800	3492800	had been reporting for numerous years,
3492800	3495800	the XF-131 Super Sentinel.
3495800	3499800	Each of these engineers wanted their story told without threats to their lives.
3499800	3502800	Jail time or stripping of pensions.
3502800	3507800	Does this sound familiar to anybody about the current state of UAP whistleblowers?
3507800	3510800	The four men had found each other over a number of decades
3510800	3515800	while being employed at various facilities surrounding the California high desert.
3515800	3519800	The two Northrop employees hailed from a facility called Tehan,
3519800	3522800	or Tehachapi Ranch by UFO researchers.
3522800	3526800	McDonald claims he was able to confirm this testimony through friends of his father
3526800	3528800	and his father's mentor Robert Scandrett,
3528800	3532800	who worked for Rock L International Strategic Systems Division.
3532800	3537800	The other two claimed to work for Ben Rich at Lockheed Skunkworks in Glendale, California
3537800	3542800	and worked the radar cross-section range known as Hellendale.
3542800	3545800	First off, let's quickly recall a similarity to TR-3B
3545800	3550800	when Fushay asked if Kelly Johnson was the senior project designer for TR-3B,
3550800	3551800	he responded, quote,
3551800	3554800	No, it would have been Ben Rich, end quote.
3554800	3559800	Second, the Hellendale facility located very closely to Edwards Air Force Base
3559800	3561800	in Palmdale, USAF Plant 42,
3561800	3566800	two locations I have directly accused of housing reverse engineering programs,
3566800	3569800	would later be accused by Steven Greer and others
3569800	3574800	as a currently ongoing black-budget deep-six UAP reverse engineering location.
3574800	3577800	Now, interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee
3577800	3580800	and other senior officials had no idea of this.
3580800	3587800	The top people in Special Forces who are outside this illegal black project system
3587800	3589800	didn't know about it.
3589800	3591800	I had known about it since the 90s,
3591800	3596800	but I'd never, of course, flown directly over it because it's classified or spaced and very sensitive.
3596800	3603800	So, you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.
3603800	3611800	It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come out.
3611800	3613800	They go up and they hover.
3613800	3614800	They're silent.
3614800	3616800	They're electro-grabbitic, anti-grab.
3616800	3620800	The diamond on the left, you see, it looks like a runway with a diamond.
3620800	3624800	It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get, there's not an aerodynamic.
3624800	3625800	They just go boom, up.
3625800	3627800	But they're placed over different diamonds.
3627800	3629800	I have a whole series of video and pictures of these.
3629800	3631800	We don't have time to go through.
3631800	3639800	And that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon
3639800	3644800	to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict, right?
3644800	3650800	Five years before Greer would first label the Lockheed Martin-Hellendale plant as a program location,
3650800	3654800	McDonald's stated the location was designed to be hidden in plain sight.
3654800	3657800	Utilizing the cover of a radar cross-section facility,
3657800	3661800	the location's exterior features a storm drainage flood control channel,
3661800	3667800	which allegedly truly serves as a short runway or platform for the testing of these craft.
3667800	3671800	And here is where things get very, very, very interesting.
3671800	3676800	As I mentioned earlier, I have spoken to McDonald about the XF-131
3676800	3680800	and he maintains the four engineers were indeed delivering true testimony.
3680800	3684800	I even asked for the individual's identities or leads on the case
3684800	3687800	so I might contact and interview them myself.
3687800	3689800	He has sworn to protect their identities.
3689800	3694800	In the Teha Chape triangle drawing, McDonald exclaimed if viewers recognize the craft,
3694800	3699800	Fox Network contracted McDonald's work and made a computer render of the vehicle
3699800	3705800	for the first regular season episode of the X-Files in the episode titled Deep Throat.
3705800	3709800	This fantastic episode, probably my favorite of the whole series,
3709800	3713800	follows the main characters investigating the disappearance of a USAF test pilot.
3713800	3718800	A mysterious informant tells one of the lead investigators, Mulder, to stay away from the case.
3718800	3722800	Utilizing research and testimony I played at the beginning of this section,
3722800	3727800	Mulder learned that the craft, the Super Sentinel, was a reverse engineered craft
3727800	3730800	from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico case.
3730800	3734800	Investigating the airfield late at night, a triangular shaped craft
3734800	3738800	darts and hovers over Mulder before rapidly speeding away.
3743800	3761800	Music
3761800	3767800	Mulder is then captured by Air Force personnel and given a cocktail to forget about what he saw,
3767800	3771800	but not before he caught a glimpse of the craft in a hangar.
3771800	3786800	Music
3786800	3790800	Rumors persist of the X-Files screenwriter, Chris Carter,
3790800	3795800	mentioning he had been approached by unknown military brass who asked how he knew so much.
3795800	3798800	However, I can find no credible sources here,
3798800	3804800	but what I can find is referenced paranormal writer and 25 year FBI investigator veteran
3804800	3808800	and inspiration for much of the X-Files, John DeSousa.
3808800	3811800	In 2023, DeSousa put out a video on YouTube titled,
3811800	3818800	John DeSousa, 25 year veteran of FBI, John DeSousa is exposing the truth of the UAP invasion.
3818800	3823800	And while I voraciously disagree with the Project Bluebeam fake invasion narrative,
3823800	3828800	DeSousa does make some very interesting remarks directly stating the first season of the X-Files
3828800	3831800	was based off true cases he investigated.
3832800	3837800	The craziest one that I'm still not supposed to talk about,
3837800	3847800	but I can say that it was featured in the first episode of the X-Files
3847800	3851800	or maybe it was the second of the first season.
3851800	3856800	By the way, they used my stories during the first season of the X-Files
3856800	3861800	and then after that they went to other, they no longer used my cases.
3861800	3868800	However, the rest of the X-Files was all based on true stories as well.
3868800	3882800	However, I would say the craziest UFO, the craziest paranormal case was when I was sent to a military base.
3883800	3887800	I can say in general terms, I was sent to a military base,
3887800	3894800	we observed a military base where they had had several disappearances
3894800	3900800	that were associated with the appearance of UFOs in the area.
3900800	3905800	And there were UFOs that the military base said, the commander said,
3905800	3908800	I don't know what to do with this, I'm at my wits end.
3908800	3918800	And so we went to observe these UFOs that had been coming to the outskirts of this military base.
3918800	3922800	And on a regular basis, and they were filled with light.
3922800	3927800	They were filled with light, almost like they didn't even appear metal anymore.
3927800	3931800	And they would just come to the edge of this forest.
3931800	3936800	And there was a group of people who would just do a regular observance of these things.
3936800	3941800	And so myself and my partner, we went and we were with those people.
3941800	3951800	And for some reason, one of the UFOs picked us out for some reason and came directly at us, came directly at us.
3951800	3955800	And just, it appeared to land on us at some point.
3955800	3958800	All the people ran, everyone ran, including us.
3958800	3964800	But it appeared to land on us, but then it didn't because it disappeared somehow.
3964800	3974800	And then we had people from the base who took me in, who took me in against my will.
3974800	3981800	They took me in and they interrogated me as to what my knowledge was of the UFOs.
3981800	3988800	It is endlessly fascinating, Chris Carter of the X-Files specifically contracted McDonald's Tehachapi Triangle,
3988800	3994800	an allegedly real reverse engineered ARV for an episode based on true events.
3994800	3999800	This case is seen further investigation for myself behind the scenes.
4019800	4022800	It's been insanely busy. So I appreciate everybody sticking by me.
4022800	4028800	Please look forward to the Jesse Michaels interview or kind of project and the Eric Davis interview,
4028800	4030800	which I think everybody will find fascinating.
4030800	4034800	I'll probably use clips from an every single project I do from now on here coming shortly.
4034800	4037800	So let's kind of break down what we discussed today.
4037800	4045800	I for one was super excited to take on this project because I think whenever people think of triangular shaped UAP to ARV to anything,
4045800	4047800	they associate it with TR3B.
4047800	4053800	And a lot of the time people don't really know the full story of Edgar Fouchet and kind of the story behind TR3B.
4053800	4061800	I know when getting kind of B-roll and footage and images for this video, quite often the X-F131 Super Sentinel, the TR3A,
4061800	4066800	and another craft called the TR3E are often confused for TR3B.
4066800	4074800	Now, the reason I didn't cover TR3E is this is often used as kind of a toy model based off recovered,
4074800	4076800	based off reverse engineered craft.
4076800	4079800	And I have actually talked to some artists who have drawn this TR3E.
4079800	4082800	For those of you kind of listening right now saying what the heck is he talking about?
4082800	4090800	This is the triangle design that almost has sort of a concave lines in between the vertexes with kind of fins and grates similar to the TR3B
4090800	4093800	and a smallish dome on top.
4093800	4100800	So maybe we'll visit TR3E at this time, but I didn't see too much evidence or worthwhile study here.
4100800	4103800	So I know sort of the breakdown of these craft can be quite complex.
4103800	4105800	So let's just go through that real fast.
4105800	4114800	On one hand, we have X-F131 Super Sentinel, which varies greatly to the TR3B and other triangular designs due to the almost pyramid shape on top
4114800	4118800	that is most similar to the 1999 Kirby England Sighting.
4118800	4122800	And on this side, we have the Aurora program, let's just say.
4122800	4126800	Within Aurora, there's codename Astra, which is the TR3B.
4126800	4134800	Astra is standing for Advanced Stealth Technology Reconnaissance Aircraft, and the TR and TR3B is standing for Tactical Reconnaissance.
4134800	4142800	The TR3B is the reverse engineered craft that is gravity resistant with companies such as Sandia, Lawrence Livermore,
4142800	4146800	Lockheed, and Northrop spearheaded by CIA, NSA, et cetera, et cetera.
4146800	4151800	Also in that same Aurora program, possibly, is the TR3A,
4151800	4158800	which may use advanced stealth concepts and advanced concepts such as electrogravitics for internal mass reduction,
4158800	4161800	or something like pulse detonation engines.
4161800	4166800	But let's remember that this craft is generally considered more prosaic with a cockpit and so forth,
4166800	4170800	and this may have been what crashed at Boscombe down in 1994.
4170800	4174800	So there's the TR3A, the TR3B, and possibly the TR3E.
4174800	4180800	Remember what Fuchet said? He said there's a whole host of craft in the TR, the tactical reconnaissance line,
4180800	4184800	just the same with the strategic reconnaissance, the SR line.
4184800	4195800	You know, there's the SR71, and Fuchet alleged that at least concepts of an SR74 and 75 were in development while he worked within the defense world and so forth.
4195800	4207800	So I almost find the description that Ed gives of DARCE and other kind of contractors almost more interesting than the TR3B itself.
4207800	4214800	For example, looking at his FOIA Pride documents and seeing the AFFTC, the Air Force Flight Test Center,
4214800	4223800	is really critical for me to be able to analyze this story and start to relay this to other stories or other investigation I've done.
4223800	4235800	You know, him talking about Project Redlight with EGNG for the DOE while EGNG runs Area 51, we can also see that Sandia and I think it's Lawrence Livermore were partners for NEST,
4235800	4239800	Nuclear Emergency Search teams or something like that, but NEST teams.
4239800	4244800	So there's all these delicious little tie-ins, especially when Fuchet mentions treats.
4244800	4250800	As we saw, there's one mention publicly available of treat I could possibly find.
4250800	4255800	And this could be the Army inscom under Stubblebind's version of the Men in Black.
4255800	4264800	But you know, sticking to the video topic, I don't know enough about the physics of TR3B to kind of dispute the craft like Jeremy Rice does.
4264800	4271800	And speaking of that, guys, I'm not looking to get involved in any drama or throw my hat in the ring and defend or criticize Fuchet.
4272800	4283800	I simply thought it important to when you have disclosures as impactful and key as Fuchet is to say, hey, there have been individuals who have brought up issues with certain things he's done.
4283800	4291800	And I just thought it important to relay those and kind of throw in my opinion of what I thought about some of the criticisms.
4291800	4296800	I'm not really trying to get involved or squabble with any of the players still active.
4296800	4302800	So just know that. I do that in good faith by just kind of talking about the arguments.
4302800	4306800	So TR3B XF131 Super Sentinel.
4306800	4311800	TR3B, there's 200 foot test models and 600 foot operational models.
4311800	4319800	The description of the craft down to the diffuse red light on the bottom is very similar to what numerous people have relayed seen.
4319800	4329800	I mean, I'll scroll through any YouTube video of a triangle sighting or I'll talk to anybody at Jujitsu and they'll all say that, yeah, I've had a UFO sighting or my uncle or somebody I know did.
4329800	4333800	They saw a triangle that three right white lights and a red one.
4333800	4336800	These sort of sightings seem almost ubiquitous.
4336800	4337800	They seem very common.
4337800	4347800	And then there's something like the XF131 Super Sentinel whose size is much smaller, whose underside is far more intriguing with the, you know,
4347800	4352800	we didn't really dive into the physics for the engineering because that information is unavailable to myself.
4352800	4362800	But with a large light that seems almost maneuverable on bottom, followed by three pairs of lights kind of on each side of the triangle.
4362800	4366800	I hope everybody enjoyed seeing that in X files.
4366800	4368800	I myself am kind of a new X files fan.
4368800	4376800	So I've seen that episode and watching Mulder kind of pursue this subject about the Air Force test pilots who have gone missing.
4376800	4382800	Just to encounter the triangle, which was reverse engineered from technology at Roswell is so intriguing to me.
4382800	4391800	I myself put a lot of weight on both Fuchet and the TR3B as well as the XF131 Super Sentinel.
4391800	4404800	I have been and will continue to be investigating that specific craft and that specific story as it is just extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely intriguing to myself.
4404800	4408800	But I do want to know what everybody thought about TR3B.
4408800	4418800	You know, after analyzing the full extent to which Fuchet gave testimony, I don't think his story is as simple as, hey, he saw the Belgian UFO wave and he's trying to glom on.
4418800	4421800	I just, I don't think it's as simple as that.
4421800	4433800	Now, the most valid criticism of Ed is besides his three sightings, which were not under program operations, he did not work firsthand on the TR3B.
4433800	4438800	Much of this information was relayed from Gerald, from Bud, from Doc, from Sal, and so forth.
4438800	4442800	So he is ultimately relaying secondhand information.
4442800	4455800	Now, of course, Gerald died pretty soon after their first meeting, but if any of these other gentlemen are still around, Fuchet has not, he has passed and can share this information, please reach out to me.
4455800	4471800	Let's kind of, let's discuss this a little more because the way I see things right now is that there's likely not one, at least two types of ARV that DOD, the Air Force, 412 test group and legacy programs have.
4471800	4480800	This is something like the flux liner, the flying saucer craft that either operates off of electrogravity, magneto hydrodynamics, or zero point energy systems.
4480800	4491800	And then there's something a little less pretty in the triangles, and these likely operate off of electrogravity or MFD devices, MHD devices, as Fuchet talked about.
4491800	4500800	You know, the triangles are not, are not capable of what we would assume NHI and what we analyze NHI craft are capable of with the six observables.
4500800	4507800	Fuchet will talk about the TR3B doing impossible maneuvers, right turns that are very close to actual right turns.
4507800	4517800	However, the speed limitations of this craft and so forth, all of these things, the internal and nervosal dampening, none of these things are too extreme.
4517800	4530800	And this is one of the things that stuck out to me about the flux liner as well, you know, the F4 Phantom jump sheet seats, the off the shelf components with this really interesting reverse engineered or copied propulsion system.
4530800	4540800	The TR3B and the triangles, the, you know, the XF131 Super Sentinel to extent seem very similar, that it's a human attempt to reproduce something fantastic.
4540800	4543800	Now, what are the NHI triangles?
4543800	4551800	Why, if it's true, did Psalm 101 in 1954 say that these triangles are new and little is known about them?
4551800	4557800	You know, we can start to analyze the, the triangle programs in the 80s, 90s, possibly even earlier in the 70s.
4557800	4566800	But, you know, in the 50s, these triangles, are they NHI or are they a breakaway civilizations, a precursor to programs?
4566800	4568800	These questions still exist.
4568800	4570800	These questions are super interesting.
4570800	4578800	How many prototypes of TR3B or XF131 Super Sentinel are possibly these triangles are called something else completely that we are none the wiser to.
4578800	4585800	How many prototypes were they, you know, the heat exchangers underneath the pyramid shaped top and Kirby England as a docking mechanism.
4585800	4589800	These sightings in southern Illinois with these interesting strips of lights.
4589800	4598800	The triangles are fascinating for the era reporting trends of triangles comprising one to four percent.
4598800	4604800	You would be astonished at how many people have reported seen triangle triangular shaped craft.
4604800	4606800	So I'm chewing up a lot of time here, guys.
4606800	4608800	I'm just so excited to be back.
4608800	4613800	I'd like to thank everybody for watching and we are back to our regular regularly scheduled programming.
4613800	4621800	Thank you all so much for joining me into this look into Fushay, into TR3B, into flying triangles, into ARB.
4621800	4622800	I'll catch everybody next time.
4622800	4623800	Thank you so much.
4623800	4624800	Bye.
