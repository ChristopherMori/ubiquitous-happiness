1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
For decades, humans around the world have reported sightings of dark, triangular-shaped UFOs,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,500
often featuring three bright white lights at each corner and a dull red light or structural features on the middle surface.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:21,800
Unlike classic flying saucers, orbs, egg-shaped craft, tic-tacs, and strange organic shapes like the controversial jellyfish UAP,

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,300
triangles have historically not been associated with non-human intelligence, but instead,

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,800
with deep-sixed, black-budget human reverse engineering efforts.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,500
This is somewhat due to triangular craft lacking many of the hallmarks of what some would consider NHI craft.

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,700
No visible means of propulsion, a lack of harsh angles and surface features, missing rivets, bolts, and seams,

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,500
as well as many triangular sightings occurring in concentrated periods over populated regions and military bases.

9
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,800
Triangle craft were further touched upon in the fall 2024 UAP hearings,

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,800
in which the shadowy, unacknowledged special access program, Immaculate Constellation,

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,700
saw its public report released to Congress and the American people.

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:14,000
At least some of the triangles among the rarest UAP configurations reported in the Immaculate Constellation report

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,600
have been confirmed by the USAP to be ARV, Alien Reproduction Vehicles,

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,900
the same term used by presiding program members to label the Fluxliner Flying Saucer Reproduction Vehicle

15
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,100
observed by Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Show.

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:37,700
And Representative Eric Burleson told me this was not the first time, in fact, he had heard the term ARV.

17
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:45,400
And I've seen and listened some, and had conversations about this with people from the UFO community

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:52,700
that will say that there's two types of aircraft there is, there's crap that is truly extraterrestrial

19
00:01:52,700 --> 00:02:00,000
and then there's crap that we have reverse engineered and created and for reproduced, right?

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,500
And so that report, what is unique about the Immaculate Constellation report is it's about these reproduced,

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,500
you know, basically us reproducing what is crashed.

22
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,300
But are these triangles whose descriptions are often time near identical indeed human made?

23
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,100
What can we make of the whistleblower testimony of Edgar Fouchet,

24
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:28,300
who described these craft in great detail, including a name, the TR Tactical Reconnaissance 3B?

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:35,700
What valuable evidence can we gather from slightly different triangle variations seen from the 1980s and 1990s?

26
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,100
And why would the X-Files TV show contract a triangle designed from an artist

27
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,700
who drew an alleged reverse engineered craft called the XF-131 Super Sentinel,

28
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,300
instructed by two Lockheed Martin and two Northrop Grumman engineers?

29
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:57,700
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me on another investigation into alien reproduction vehicle.

30
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,400
This time focusing on the black triangle seen throughout the globe for decades,

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,600
let's venture into the full story of the TR3B ARV,

32
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,800
a possible parallel joint Northrop and Lockheed ARV hailing from the Lockheed Martin-Hellendale Plan,

33
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,500
and strange possible ARV prototypes seen throughout the 1980s and 1990s with odd features.

34
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,900
Let us investigate the origins, configurations, and purposes of these craft allegedly built from NHI technology.

35
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:40,100
On November 13, 2024, the term ARV was entered into the Congressional Hearing Record with the Immaculate Constellation Report.

36
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,100
No, this term did not originate with Stephen Greer in 2001.

37
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,600
It can indeed be traced back to 1988 with alleged first-hand witness Brad Sorensen,

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:56,300
who observed DOD and private industry attempts to reverse engineer anti-gravity flying saucer craft.

39
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,000
And now, the Immaculate Constellation Unknown Anonymous Whistleblower Report

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,100
has labeled another craft configuration as alien reproduction vehicles, the triangle.

41
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,000
The report whose historical data tracked back to 2009 discussed a large,

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,700
equilateral triangle directly appearing over intelligence-collecting vessels.

43
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,800
Captured by Indo-PACCOM, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command,

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,900
the triangle hovered and rotated slowly 500 to 1,000 meters above the ocean.

45
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,900
Three bright points were seen at each bottom corner of the horizontally rotating triangle

46
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,700
with the horizontal bar of sweeping lights partially observed.

47
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,300
Collected intelligence revealed this triangle was a reproduction craft.

48
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,300
A second Indo-PACCOM entry detailed a fighter jet-sized, equilateral ARV triangle of unknown origin

49
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,500
hovering less than 200 meters above a vessel.

50
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,500
At least two lights were observed on the craft with at least one more obstructed on the underside of the craft

51
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,800
with the triangle slightly positioned at an upward angle.

52
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:08,000
In their 2023 and 2024 historical reports arrow-listed triangles as solely 3-4% of all reported UAPs.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
A morphology that is indeed quite uncommon.

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,800
Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official UFO Investigation Program from 1952 to 1969,

55
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,800
catalogued over 12,000 cases of varying quality.

56
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,100
Let's reference this paper titled The Blue Book Unknowns by Don Berliner,

57
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,900
which utilizes numerous criteria to analyze only the most unexplained of Blue Book cases.

58
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,000
In the 1950s, we find solely four recorded anomalous triangle sightings.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,100
These triangles are often described as colorful.

60
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,100
A far cry from our dark gray, black craft with three lights, the subject of today's analysis.

61
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:52,400
Although Arrow and Blue Book are not necessarily trustworthy, we can form a strong observation here.

62
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,300
Analyzing historical UFO reporting trends, thank you to UFOsearch.com and Richard Geldreich.

63
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:08,100
We can directly observe the time period of 1940 to 1970 and 2000 to modern day see few triangular craft sightings reported.

64
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:17,600
1970 to 2000, particularly the 1980s and 1990s, see an overwhelming number of reported triangular UFO sightings.

65
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,700
Not only does this confirm the data and claims made further in this video,

66
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:27,600
but this also suggests a worldwide multi-decade UFO flap of triangle-shaped craft.

67
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,200
With the cases and testimony we will explore in this video, a strong thesis could be constructed.

68
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:43,700
That sometime in the 1970s, legacy UFO programs began constructing triangular alien reproduction vehicles based on non-human triangular craft

69
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,600
and iterated on and tested such craft over military bases during the 1980s to 2000s.

70
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,000
And let's also reference the controversial Majestic 12 document titled Somme 101,

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,700
or the Special Operations Manual I covered at length with Ryan Wood.

72
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,900
In the description of craft from this document allegedly dated 1954,

73
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:10,000
we can find description of triangular-shaped craft amongst the saucers, spheres, cigars, etc.

74
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,600
The triangles read, quote,

75
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,300
This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and recency of observations.

76
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,800
Radar indicates Nysosceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length.

77
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,900
Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings,

78
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:35,800
but they are believed to be capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to or exceeding the performance attributed to types A and C.

79
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,300
In the midst of a slew of anonymous triangular sightings with strange lights and fixtures in the 1980s and 1990s,

80
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,000
which we will discuss later, the 1989 Belgian UFO wave arose.

81
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,900
All too often associated with the Patrick M. Hoekst photograph are labeled a case of mass delusion.

82
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,800
The Belgian Triangle UFO wave has incredible amounts of worthwhile investigation.

83
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,800
The wave is not the subject of today's video, but let's briefly discuss.

84
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:11,200
In November of 1989, hundreds of reports surfaced from Belgium of a large, flat, triangular-shaped craft with lights underneath flying at low altitudes.

85
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,800
The event culminated on the night of March 30th, 1990,

86
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,700
where an unknown object was tracked by radar and pursued by two Belgian F-16 fighters who were unable to locate the triangle.

87
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,300
Internal DOD documents once classified revealed U.S. authorities investigated the case

88
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:37,400
and even confirmed to the Belgian Air Force and Ministry of Defense that no USAF stealth aircraft such as the B-2 or F-117 were used in the region.

89
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,700
But what if this wave of sightings strangely caught on radar on March 30th, 1990

90
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:50,600
was a series of tests over an allied nation of a stealth craft even more secret than the B-2 and F-117?

91
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,200
What if this aircraft program was deep-sixed and embedded within special-access programs,

92
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,400
within reach of only those with need-to-know access in the highest clearances the US had to offer?

93
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,900
What if this craft was the TR-3B reverse-engineered triangle?

94
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,800
In at least three of my projects, I have mentioned the testimony of USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fouchet

95
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,100
and his claims of anti-gravity reverse-engineered triangular craft called TR-3B.

96
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,700
Black budget operations involving Nellis-slash-Area-51 and Edwards Air Force Base,

97
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,900
an involvement of contractors such as Lockheed Martin in non-human intelligence technology exploitation.

98
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,400
Well, now is finally the time to explore his entire testimony.

99
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,700
Edgar Albert Fouchet, sometimes referred to as Edgar Rothschild Fouchet,

100
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,000
was born in 1948 in South Central Georgia to fifth-generation Americans.

101
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,300
His family history consisted of numerous individuals in military intelligence and classified projects.

102
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,600
During the Vietnam conflict while attending college, Fouchet worked as a machinist making bombs.

103
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,900
In 1968, the young man was drafted into USAF for para-rescue basic training.

104
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,200
After fracturing his ankle at Fort Benning, Edgar completed training in electronics, communication,

105
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,900
intelligence, and cryptological methods.

106
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:21,000
From 64 to 74, Fouchet was stationed at myriad tactical air command and air training command bases,

107
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,900
including 3.5 years stationed in Vietnam and surrounding Asian bases.

108
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,200
Within USAF, Fouchet earned degrees in electronics and avionics engineering,

109
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,800
as well as a bachelor's in business and enjoyed numerous awards and a prestigious reputation

110
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,800
for his advanced skillset often sought after by military brass.

111
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,500
In the late 1970s, Fouchet would see a series of USAF-mandated stations

112
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:51,600
at the now infamous Groom Lake Area 51 facility with a top-secret clearance with crypto access.

113
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,700
Fouchet was considered an Air Force expert with classified electronic countermeasure test equipment,

114
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,100
cryptological test equipment, and automatic test equipment.

115
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,400
All while receiving around 4,000 hours of technical training from USG and DOD,

116
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
half of which was classified.

117
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,200
Late in his career working eight years as a defense contractor and engineering manager,

118
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,600
Fouchet dealt with classified black programs developing state-of-the-art electronics,

119
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,400
logistics, and technical data and automatic testing equipment.

120
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,200
The master sergeant participated as a hand-picked key member to work on USAF fighters

121
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,100
such as the F-15 Eagle Air Superiority Fighter, the A-10 Warthog, the P-1 Lancer Bomber,

122
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,800
and the F-117A stealth fighter.

123
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Fouchet claimed to have worked alongside the Defense Advanced Research Center in 1979,

124
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,100
which he stated was a minimum 10-story underground facility between Area 51 Groom Lake.

125
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,600
Fouchet was recruited to Groom Lake out of his station at Edwards Air Force Base Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

126
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,500
which he claimed also consisted of deep underground facilities.

127
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,900
The Defense Advanced Research Center, DARCE, not to be confused with DARPA,

128
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:05,200
the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency was actually a proposed institution.

129
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,700
Let's reference this declassified Advanced Project Research Agency, DARPA,

130
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,400
a lot of acronyms I know, study written in 1973.

131
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,100
This study was written as a historical evaluation of the R&D Management Institution, DARPA,

132
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,200
who at this time had established remarkably little in the way of official record or institutional memory.

133
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,900
On page 82 of the document under DARPA Laboratories discussing advanced aerospace projects,

134
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,100
we find a DOD directive showing the Army Ballistic Missile Agency

135
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,500
was considered for transfer into the Defense Advanced Research Center,

136
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,500
linking the department to the aforementioned Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

137
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,200
And it is worth noting the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was commanded by Nazi V-2 rocket scientist

138
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,600
and Operation Paperclip transfer, Werner von Braun.

139
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,300
Von Braun's mentor was father of German rocketry Hermann Oberth,

140
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,400
who performed extensive study on UFOs.

141
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,200
But back to Fuchet, it was here at DARCE he would work with advanced digital technologies

142
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,700
and gain knowledge of human-made reverse engineered craft.

143
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,800
Master Sergeant Edgar Fuchet made his first public disclosures regarding reverse engineered

144
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:24,600
anti-gravity triangular craft called TR-3B in his 1998 book, Alien Rapture,

145
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,300
and presented this data for MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network in IUFO-C,

146
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,700
the International UFO Congress after years of interviews, research, and preparation.

147
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,900
These disclosures were sourced from five close friends within DOD and classified programs,

148
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:45,100
as well as Fuchet's first-hand experience at Area 51 Groom Lake in the DARC.

149
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,600
We will focus mostly on his 1998 IUFO-C presentation,

150
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,700
as it serves as an extremely comprehensive baseline summary of Fuchet's testimony,

151
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,100
while also pulling clips and contextually relevant data from other sources and Fuchet interviews.

152
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,100
His book, Alien Rapture, is extremely similar to Secret Machines by Tom DeLonge,

153
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,300
where alleged non-fiction events are shrouded in a guise of fiction to protect names, dates, and locations.

154
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,200
Fuchet's 1998 testimony revolved around the revelations of secret government technology

155
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,400
and reverse engineered extraterrestrial artifacts.

156
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:28,000
Edgar set out with the specific goal of informing the public on the facts behind the infamously-cited flying triangles.

157
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
Before I'm through, you'll know exactly what the flying triangle is,

158
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,200
the one that's been sighted around the world.

159
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:39,200
It's the most exotic and classified aerospace vehicle that's ever been built,

160
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,300
and maybe stealthily hovering over Phoenix, Belgium, or your city.

161
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,500
And we must note, outside of his own personal sightings of the craft while in service,

162
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Fuchet did not work on the TR-3B.

163
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,600
He relayed much of the data he gathered around the TR-3B from his five close sources.

164
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,700
Let's discuss these five close sources who build much of the foundation for Fuchet's disclosures.

165
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:10,600
Edgar's closest ally was Gerald, a former National Security Agency investigator and TREAT team member.

166
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,800
TREAT stands for the Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team,

167
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,300
a.k.a. what we might call the Men in Black.

168
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,600
I can find only one publicly available mention of TREAT,

169
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,300
and this is from Lichtenstein's Crown Prince Hans Adams

170
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,500
in a letter to Dr. Stephen Greer dated August 31, 1997.

171
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:39,400
This letter from an unknown sender discusses Hans Adams in his mention in a book by author Tom Bowers called Nazi Gold.

172
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,600
Hans had previously spoken and collaborated with Greer on UAP issues to an unknown degree.

173
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,400
This sender accused the Crown Prince of having supported counterintelligence operations

174
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,700
against the American people on the subject of UFOs,

175
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:59,000
and in this letter, the sender directly accused Hans Adams of funding TREAT.

176
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,300
Adams' funding should be focused on his support for TREAT and its Grand Dom,

177
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:11,300
who is wed to a former U.S. Army General, ex-head of Army Intelligence and Security Command, end quote.

178
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,700
The general in question here is U.S. Army General and founder of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command,

179
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,400
INSCOM, Albert Stubblebein.

180
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,700
Now, I have good reason to believe Army INSCOM is likely associated with UFO crash retrievals,

181
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,400
but we will discuss this in a future project.

182
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:37,300
Major General Albert Stubblebein himself allegedly intimidated Stephen Greer to discontinue investigating UFO Black projects.

183
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,200
And the level of corruption is worrisome.

184
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:53,000
Now, in 92, General Albert Stubblebein III, Bert, who had been head of Special Forces and Army Intelligence, Fort Wachuka,

185
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,300
he intercepted me after we had this major contact event out in Florida and near Pensacola.

186
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:11,400
And he subsequently, about a month later, personally offered me $2 billion to not pursue what I was doing and become part of his team.

187
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,200
And Stubblebein is currently witness 10658 in Greer's witness log.

188
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:24,600
His witness description reads, quote, has been involved since the 1960s, former head of Fort Wachuka Army Intelligence,

189
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,300
where ET craft and bodies are stored, end quote.

190
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:35,600
What we can learn here is that quite possibly, TREAT is the real life men in black housed within U.S. Army INSCOM.

191
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,200
OK, but back to Fouchet and the first of the five disclosure advocates and team members, Gerald.

192
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,000
TREAT stands for Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team.

193
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,700
I think some of you call me in in black.

194
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,900
They work for the Department of Energy and the National Security Agency.

195
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:02,700
This was his cover, but ultimately the National Security Agency controlled all his movements and everything he did.

196
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:10,500
His job required him to watch employees with top secret and cue clearances and other classified clearances at the Nevada Test Site,

197
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,800
the Nellis Range, Los Alamos, Sandia, and many other bases.

198
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,600
He spent a lot of time out at Area 51 for years before I even knew what he was involved in.

199
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,400
This where the previously the most classified aerospace testing in the world took place.

200
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,600
You may know it as Groom Lake, Watertown, the Ranch, or Greenland.

201
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,900
He was found dead of a heart attack a year after our last meeting.

202
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:47,600
The second individual, Sal, worked directly with the National Security Agency with Electronics Intelligence and became a defense contractor upon his retirement.

203
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:55,500
Sal worked for the company that created the TR-3B gravity disruption device called the Magnetic Field Disruptor, more on this later.

204
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:02,700
The third friend, Doc, was an SR-71 spy plane pilot and USAF test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base.

205
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:12,900
Those who have watched my reverse engineering project at Edwards video will immediately recognize the importance of Edwards and the 412th test group comprising the Edwards test pilot school.

206
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,700
If you haven't, I recommend watching that, but we'll explain more during Fouché's testimony.

207
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,000
The fourth friend, Dell, served with Fouché during Vietnam.

208
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,800
Dell's father worked for the NSA for over 25 years and sent Fouché a host of Majestic 12 documents.

209
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:37,100
The fifth member, Rand Budd, was a DOD contractor electronics engineer who worked on top secret R&D programs with electronic countermeasures.

210
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:47,800
The men were perturbed by the fact each had been privy to unusual phenomena, extremely advanced technology, and unidentified aerial vehicles that had not been reported.

211
00:19:47,800 --> 00:20:02,800
As we sat at a table in a dark corner of the Silver Dollar Saloon in Las Vegas, discussing our experiences and swapping knowledge, each of the group of five assured me that they trusted me enough to write about their secrets and protect them.

212
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:11,500
We agreed to get together the next year with an understanding that I would contact each of them and set up the meeting.

213
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:21,800
In the meantime, I wrote down all of our notes and their input and their context from other friends about unusual phenomena and their personal sightings.

214
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:28,500
Many of the things the group revealed to me were startling, even to me who had worked 25 years on black programs.

215
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:35,000
But before we continue, let's walk things back and get to know Fouché and his station in black programs a little bit better.

216
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:45,100
In 1979, after working at Nellis with top secret crypto access clearance, Fouché received a request for temporary reassignment to a place with no name.

217
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:52,200
Fouché's commanding officer had no idea where he was going, who he would be working with, or what he would be working on.

218
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:59,900
And while we're here, let's take a longer look at this document obtained via FOIA, discussing a promotional recommendation for Fouché.

219
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:11,800
Fouché was assigned to Detachment 3, AFFTC, which is the Air Force Flight Test Center Detachment from Edwards Air Force Base that runs operations at Area 51 Groom Lake.

220
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:23,000
Remember how witness Ed stated he was read into UAP programs at Nellis and Area 51 S4 before moving on to become a test director of reverse engineered craft at Edwards.

221
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,900
Edgar left on a Monday morning at 4.30 a.m. and boarded a dark blue USAF bus with blacked out windows.

222
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,400
28 other people sat on the bus, not including two security policemen.

223
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,900
All personnel were ordered not to speak to one another.

224
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:45,000
After several hours, the bus came to rest and Fouché knew immediately where he was, Groom Lake, Area 51.

225
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:55,900
According to the Master Sergeant, the top secret SR-75, SR-74, and TR-3B operated out of Groom Lake and have historically been misidentified as UFOs.

226
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,100
Upon reaching Groom Lake, the bus entered a hangar and the doors were shut.

227
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,100
Security personnel checked in Fouché and the others.

228
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:11,900
He was given a pair of heavy glasses, similar to welder's goggles, that obscured his peripheral vision and restricted vision to within 30 feet.

229
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,200
For the next 10 consecutive days and further on follow-up visits, Fouché's routine was the same.

230
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,400
Leave Nellis before sunrise and return to Nellis after dark.

231
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:30,300
Fouché would write down everything he saw and heard at Groom Lake, including hearing topics discussed such as pulse detonation, cyclotronic radiation,

232
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:37,100
quantum flux, transduction field generators, quasi-crystal energy lenses, and EPR quantum receivers.

233
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:45,000
Pulse detonation may remind you of the Aurora Pulsar craft seen by Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Show.

234
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm not going to talk about quasi-crystals. I'll make a prediction.

235
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,600
Quasi-crystals is the key to everything you want to ever know about how they got here.

236
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,600
That's all I'm going to say about it now, except one of the quasi-crystals is the hydrogen crystal.

237
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:09,200
His station at Groom Lake is also where Fouché would meet TREAT, aka Men in Black Agent, Gerald.

238
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:18,500
According to Fouché, on Area 51 is the super-secret laboratory named the Defense Advanced Research Center, of which we can only find one official mention.

239
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:26,800
DARS consists of 10 underground stories next to a mountain near Papouse Lake south of Groom Lake and is nestled next to a hangar in the side of a mountain,

240
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,300
which stores the TR-3B reverse-engineered craft.

241
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:39,400
The DARS's objectives were fully realized in the mid-1980s, according to Fouché, when it was bolstered with SDI money under the Reagan administration.

242
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:48,000
Viewers of my channel will recall multiple times in which I have discussed sources commenting on the Strategic Defense Initiative SDI under Reagan,

243
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,600
serving a secondary purpose to protect the U.S. mainland from ballistic missiles.

244
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:58,700
This secondary purpose being the detection of and offensive capabilities against UAP.

245
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:08,100
Fouché claimed his sources estimated up to 35% of SDI's funding was siphoned off to support USAF Black Program starting in 1982.

246
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,900
First-hand ARV witness Brad Sorensen was additionally told in 1988,

247
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:19,000
by the men in charge of the ARV exhibit, they were requesting funding to build more of these reverse-engineered craft.

248
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,900
The Reagan admin placed extreme importance on the building of ARVs.

249
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:31,100
Shockingly, Fouché stated Defense Contractor EG&G not only provided classified R&D for Black projects,

250
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:37,900
technical and scientific support for nuclear and energy R&D, but also EG&G built these hidden bunkers,

251
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,800
mountain hangars, and vast underground facilities at Groom Lake,

252
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,000
Papouse, and Mercury for the government, housing facilities such as DARS.

253
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,200
The mention of these facilities ties into the topic of DUMMS, deep underground military bases, which I will explore in the future.

254
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Alongside EG&G, the RAND Corporation more than likely has a hand here.

255
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:07,500
Edgar would also claim he gathered knowledge EG&G was awarded an indefinite contract for Project Red Light to support the Department of Energy and Military.

256
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,900
This contract gave them responsibility to assist in the recovery of nuclear materials in cases of mishaps

257
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,200
and to provide aerial and ground security for highly classified government and military sites.

258
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,200
One's mind may be drawn here to the Nuclear Emergency Support Team supported by EG&G,

259
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:35,000
but Project Red Light was also relayed to Leonard Stringfield in his crash retrieval status reports by a witness claiming the project served to test NHI and reverse engineered craft

260
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
on the Nellis test range after the craft had been shipped from Edwards Air Force Base.

261
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,900
Sources of the Master Sergeant claimed as of 1992 the Air Force conducted a contingency plan due to so many public eyes on Area 51.

262
00:25:48,900 --> 00:26:00,900
This would see the majority of exotic aircraft platforms relocated to Utah, likely Dugway Proving Grounds, Colorado, Alaska, Greenland, Diego Garcia and south of Area 51 to S-4.

263
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:09,900
But at Papoose where they store one of the TR-3Bs and they maintain these as their depot, it's built into the side of a mountain cut out of stone.

264
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:18,800
They have a holographic generator that generates the side of the mountain and when you're 10 feet from the side of this mountain and looking into the hangar you can always see a mountain.

265
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:30,800
And that's why when the Russian satellites fly over to verify the salt treaty, when they're infrared and other spectral scanners shoot down at groom, they only see stone because that's all that's there.

266
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Just before the state of 1992, there is strangely enough evidence to show a heavy focus on strange exotic aircraft programs out of Area 51, possibly UFO related.

267
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:53,800
In 1990, James defense writer James Goodall revealed a thesis of at least eight black programs flying out of Area 51 Groom Lake including a silent triangle utilizing unconventional technologies.

268
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:02,800
A source Goodall knew for 12 years was stationed at Groom Lake and explained that UAP positively exist at the base while another source of his stated quote,

269
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:20,800
we have things out there that are literally out of this world, better than Star Trek or anything you can see in the movies and quote, and now we finally get into a full body description of the TR-3B craft.

270
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Finally, I've saved the best for last, the operational model of the TR-3B.

271
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:39,800
A friend of mine said he had never forget the sight of the alien looking TR-3B landing at Papu's south of Groom. The pitch black triangular shaped TR-3B is rarely mentioned and then only in whispers.

272
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:58,800
This craft, the most classified aerospace development program in existence at the time, codename Astra, advanced stealth technology reconnaissance aircraft, saw 200 feet diameter testing models and three and 600 feet diameter operational models.

273
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:13,800
The tactical reconnaissance TR-3B operated as the most exotic model under the Aurora program, according to Fouché, the same program umbrella that oversaw the pulse detonation UAV Pulsar craft observed by Brad Sorensen.

274
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:19,800
And we may have some clues regarding this family of Aurora craft in previous DoD budgets.

275
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:31,800
In DoD procurement programs, we can find an Aurora project the DoD planned to spend $80 million on in fiscal year 86 and $2.3 billion on in fiscal year 87.

276
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:39,800
This 25 times increase in spending is enormous and at the time was double the cost of the B2 Spirit Bomber program.

277
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:57,800
The Aurora program may have included the reverse engineered TR-3B Lockheed Pulsar as seen by Sorensen and a little known craft titled the SR-33A introduced by Dr. Michael Wolfe, an alleged UAP consultant to the National Security Council special subcommittee.

278
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Similar to TR-3B and Pulsar, the SR-33A allegedly utilized conventional fuel and anti-gravity field propulsion systems to operate under a secret space program.

279
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:16,800
The first flight ready operational model of TR-3B occurred in the early 1990s built through SDI and black budget monies.

280
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,800
By 1994, at least three of the billion dollar plus operational models were flying.

281
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:29,800
But Fouchet had seen the prototype model or a different model three times previously far before 1994.

282
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:37,800
And according to his sources, there were numerous prototypes with the first anti-gravity warping craft flying in the early 1970s.

283
00:29:37,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Not only did he claim to have seen photographs of TR-3B from a C-130 flying mission support for the reverse engineered craft, but Fouchet also claimed to have observed the triangles one night in 1975 high in the atmosphere over Edwards Air Force Base as well as 1976 within the southern part of Nellis Range and lastly in 1979 at Groom Lake.

284
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:08,800
This prototype model looked fairly similar to Fouchet's official model, but with different engines on the tip and no rotable crew compartment.

285
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,800
I do recommend checking out part six of author Andrew Johnson's interviews with Fouchet to hear more about his sightings.

286
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,800
For the interest of time, I will not show these long clips here.

287
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:29,800
But let's hear about more aspects of the TR-3B Fouchet learned from sources within black programs and his five disclosure comrades and then discuss how the propulsion and engineering system allegedly functioned.

288
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:42,800
According to these sources, the original TR-3B craft design was reverse engineered by Sandia National Labs in Livermore laboratories from a non-human intelligence crash recovery from an unknown date or location.

289
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Sandia may be familiar to some as the laboratory nestled within Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico has been often historically implicated with UFO material recovery.

290
00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Seeing numerous mentions within the MJ-12 documents such as the Eisenhower briefing document and interplanetary phenomenon unit reports.

291
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:15,800
Livermore Labs now called Lawrence Livermore is one of three national security enterprise FFRDCs, federally funded research and development centers sponsored by the DOE to support U.S. nuclear deterrence.

292
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,800
The other two locations are Los Alamos National Labs and of course, Sandia.

293
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:38,800
I myself have been told alongside UARC's university affiliated research centers, FFRDCs are semi-private institutions that serve to operate alongside DOD and corporate legacy programs for material exploitation, reverse engineering, etc.

294
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Other FFRDCs include Oak Ridge National Laboratory owned by Battelle where our good friend Sean Kirkpatrick ran off to after Aero as well as numerous institutions run by the MITRE Corporation and RAND Corporation.

295
00:31:52,800 --> 00:32:01,800
MITRE and RAND will receive their own projects in the near future as I believe these semi-private institutions are integral corporations involved in legacy programs.

296
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Those unfamiliar with UARC just need to look back at my work on the 1965 Kecksburg crash.

297
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Dr. Eric A. Walker, president of Penn State, self-admitted he oversaw the Kecksburg crash site.

298
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Walker had also previously set up Penn State's UARC, the Applied Research Laboratory at the behest of the U.S. Navy.

299
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:35,800
And let's not forget, as of 2024, the untrustworthy Aero under new leadership of Dr. Koslowski admitted Aero, a likely whistleblower honeypot with contracts with Sandcorp, a company built to prevent whistleblower leaks.

300
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Stated Aero works alongside UARC and FFRDC.

301
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Sure, right now, most of our collaborations that are bearing towards academia are with UARC, university-affiliated research centers associated with universities or with FFRDCs.

302
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:59,800
All this is to say, Fuchet's accusations that Sandia and Lawrence reverse-engineered NHI craft is a sober and rational statement.

303
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:16,800
Edgar would also state the TR3B program was managed by the NRO, CIA, and NSA, and the craft was built primarily by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne, Ryan, and a number of other defense contractors to keep R&D compartmentalized.

304
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,800
There is a lot to break down here.

305
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:34,800
One, due to the excellent work of Chris Sharp and an upcoming interview that I have with Dr. Eric Davis, yes, of the Wilson Davis memo, we can implicate the CIA directorate of science and technology with support agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office,

306
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:45,800
National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and likely the National Security Agency as leading teams behind UFO crash retrievals.

307
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Fuchet mentioning Lockheed Martin needs no further explanation.

308
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:55,800
I do recommend checking out both my Mark McCandless video and Lockheed Martin investigation. Find them in the video description.

309
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Now, Boeing is indeed an interesting mention.

310
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Director of Edward's 412th Electronic Warfare Group, ED, stated he worked alongside Boeing and Lockheed on reverse-engineered craft systems at the Nellis Range.

311
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Boeing will additionally receive a video of its own, but for now let's reference a fascinating 2013 project by stealth aircraft researcher John Joseph.

312
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Joseph claims Boeing served as the primary contractor in Project Brilliant, an SDI program with the goal of setting up an electromagnetic shield around the U.S. using a boomerang-shaped craft that could loiter over cities.

313
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,800
Northrop Grumman has as much as Lockheed Martin been historically implicated with the creation of TR-3B.

314
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Let's hold off on discussing them for now, as later I would like to tackle a possible triangle variant constructed by Northrop Grumman.

315
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Fuchet knew the TR-3B housed a crew of four and served as logistics support and transport for a secret space command.

316
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,800
These pilots were top graduates of Navy and USAF test pilot schools, mainly out of the Edwards 412th Test School.

317
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Edwards Witness ED additionally made these same claims.

318
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:14,800
The craft employed two nuclear reactors, was comprised of advanced composites, metal materials, and titanium, and employed variable-vectored intake and thrusters on the edges,

319
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,800
and advanced multi-mode propulsion engines on each tip of the triangle.

320
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:28,800
The triangle has three lights on each tip, a large diffuse light on the bottom center due to the MFD drive, and featured almost no sound but a magnetic humming.

321
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,800
The TR-3B outer coating was reactive to electrical radar stimulation and can change reflectiveness radar absorption.

322
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Fuchet described the outer skin-slash panels as electrochromatic, which would camouflage the craft for daytime stealth operations.

323
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,800
But let's further dive into the propulsion system from Edgar's own words.

324
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,800
The circular plasma-filled accelerator ring, called the Magnetic Field Disruptor, surrounds a rotatable crew compartment.

325
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,800
It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology.

326
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed a reverse-engineered MFD, and I believe the government will go at any lengths to protect this technology.

327
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,800
But you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you. Nor am I.

328
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,800
The government will go at any lengths.

329
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Believe me, the plasma in this accelerator is mercury-based.

330
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:34,800
It's pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin, superconductivity, and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute to create a superconductive plasma with a resulting gravity energy.

331
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:44,800
The MFD generates a magnetic vortex field, which disrupts and neutralizes the effects of gravity on mass within proximity by 89%.

332
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,800
Do not misunderstand. This is not anti-gravity. Anti-gravity you can use as a propulsive force.

333
00:36:51,800 --> 00:37:01,800
The mass of the circular accelerator and all the mass within the accelerator, such as the crew compartment, avionics, MFD systems, fuels, environmental systems,

334
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,800
and nuclear reactor are reduced by 89%.

335
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:17,800
This causes the effect of making an aircraft extremely light and able to outperform any aircraft yet constructed, except, of course, those we didn't build.

336
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,800
TR-3B is a high-altitude stealth reconnaissance platform with indefinite loader time.

337
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Once you get it up there at speed, it doesn't take much propulsion to maintain altitude.

338
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,800
With the vehicle's mass reduced by 89%, the vehicle can travel at Mach 9 vertically or horizontally.

339
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:45,800
So for those that have had sightings of things making right, and they're not perfect right turns, obviously, nothing can make a perfect right turn.

340
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,800
It's against the laws of physics, but it sure looks like a right turn at a distance.

341
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
For those that have seen it, that's how they do it.

342
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:00,800
TR-3B uses three multi-mode thrusters mounted on each corner of the triangular platform.

343
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,800
The multi-mode propulsion system can operate in the atmosphere with thrust provided by the nuclear reactor,

344
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,800
and in the upper atmosphere with hydrogen and propulsion, and in orbit with combined hydrogen and oxygen propulsion.

345
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:24,800
A key component of TR-3B propulsion as described by Fouchet states its MFD technology built from reversed engineered UAP is not anti-gravity necessarily.

346
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Anti-gravity by definition provides a propulsive force that can be used for propulsion.

347
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:37,800
MFD creates a quote-unquote disruption of the Earth's gravitational field upon the mass within the circular accelerator.

348
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Such systems leveraged from non-human technology may indeed be present and highly secret but acknowledged to aircraft systems.

349
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,800
One such example may be the Northrop Grumman B-2 stealth bomber.

350
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,800
UFO researchers such as Dr. Richard Boylan have reported three star generals and retired USAF Colonel Donald Ware

351
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:03,800
have disclosed the B-2 carry's onboard electro-gravitic systems to cause internal mass reduction on the wings and fuselage of the craft,

352
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,800
which directly leads to the over $1 billion price tag for each craft.

353
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,800
The question is, and Mark talked about this before, is there more going on to the B-2 than meets the eye?

354
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Aviation Week Space Technology March 9, 1992 had a very interesting article from people who worked at Northrop

355
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:32,800
who were very upset that the technology associated with the B-2 program was not being trickled down to the public industry.

356
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,800
They talk about how the B-2 electrically charges the leading edge of the wing to reduce the radar cross-signature,

357
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,800
that's what you see in this diagram right here, and then negatively charges the exhaust gases to reduce the infrared signature.

358
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:52,800
This is the same type of electro-gravitic technology that T-Towns and Brown had originally proposed in the 1930s,

359
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,800
so this technology might date back a lot earlier than we originally thought.

360
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,800
And before we move on, remember earlier when Edgar Fouchet mentioned ASTRA, Advanced Stealth Technology Reconnaissance Aircraft,

361
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,800
served as the codename for TR-3B? Well, we may in fact have a crash retrieval of this craft.

362
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:19,800
In Ryan Wood's masterpiece Magic Eyes Only, we can find a case dated September 26, 1994 from Bosscom Down, England.

363
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,800
This case file references a publication from the November 1994 edition of Air Force Monthly,

364
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:32,800
which discusses an unusual crash landing on the runway of the UK government's highly secret Bosscom Down facility.

365
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Rumors quickly circulated the crash was of a flying triangle seen by UFO witnesses for decades.

366
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,800
The Air Force Monthly article reads,

367
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Shortly after the crash, an unmarked civilian registered CIA operated, Boeing 737 and a similarly anonymous DC-8,

368
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:59,800
visited and two days later the wreck was loaded onto a CC-5 Galaxy and flown to Air Force Plant 42 at Palmdale, California.

369
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,800
The secrecy surrounding the incident has led to speculation that the aircraft involved was a TR-3A,

370
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,800
the existence of which the US government has yet to officially acknowledge.

371
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:18,800
While this publication mentions the crash of a TR-3A, and Fuchet does indeed state the TR-3A exists,

372
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,800
but is remarkably different from TR-3B, it's worth noting quite often in the public realm,

373
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:31,800
TR-3A and TR-3B are often used almost interchangeably, so perhaps this crash case is referencing TR-3B.

374
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,800
And this distinction is key to explore further, as terminology around TR-3A is quite confusing.

375
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Quite often I have seen the TR-3A referred to as the pumpkin seed, a craft utilizing pulse detonation engines,

376
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,800
the same unmanned craft Brad Sorensen saw in 1988.

377
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,800
While other sources refer to TR-3A as a delta-shaped fighter featuring a cockpit,

378
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,800
pulse detonation engines, and electro-gravitics for internal mass reduction are complementary field propulsion for high speeds.

379
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:09,800
But while exploring this A and B distinction under co-name Astra, there is a fascinating tangent I want to cover.

380
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Let's reference Secret Machines by Tom DeLonge and A.J. Hartley,

381
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,800
an extremely famous science fiction novel in the UFO community that fuses the imagination of DeLonge

382
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,800
with actual events obtained from U.S. military and government sources,

383
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,800
a literary device known as a Romana clay.

384
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:36,800
Facts in this book were allegedly given to DeLonge by advisors such as the commander of the Air Force Research Lab at Wright Patterson Air Force Base,

385
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,800
multiple Lockheed Martin Skunkworks officials such as Eric Schrock and others.

386
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:48,800
This excellent book makes numerous mentions to an astro-black triangle reverse engineered craft, quote,

387
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,800
The craft itself, according to its data manual, was triangular and was named the Astra-3B,

388
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,800
but we just call it the Locust, said Beaker with a smile.

389
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:04,800
He was proud to be connected to it. The Locust had control layouts unlike those used in any aircraft he had ever seen.

390
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,800
Controls that were not just familiar, but counter-intuitive to anyone with a basic sense of aviation or aerospace physics, end quote.

391
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,800
But what I really want to draw attention to here is the description of the Astra's control mechanism.

392
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:25,800
When characters in the film operate the Astra-3B Locust, the pilot's chair looked disappointingly like that from an F-16,

393
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:31,800
but on the left armrest of the pilot's seat sat a red sphere sitting in a cradle, quote,

394
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,800
Alan turned the sphere under his hand and the craft rotated cleanly, too cleanly in the air.

395
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:44,800
He then applied a little thrust and was moving. The landmarks of Paris, including the Eiffel Tower, zipping past them in a blur.

396
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,800
He pursed his lips. State of the art it may be, but it didn't feel like flight.

397
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,800
No aircraft could pivot on a dime like he had just done, end quote.

398
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Quote.

399
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,800
He engaged the manual system and cupped his hand over the red trackball on his armrest.

400
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,800
He rolled it gently in the Locust pivoted in place. Quote.

401
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,800
He engaged the manual system and cupped his hand over the red trackball on the armrest.

402
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,800
He rolled it gently in the Locust pivoted in place.

403
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,800
He did it again, applying a little thrust with his other hand, and the ship changed direction again,

404
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,800
leaping hard to the west and then climbing in a dizzying spiral before screaming back to the southeast.

405
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,800
Of course, there was no screaming, except perhaps inside Alan's head,

406
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,800
as the laws of physics seemed to implode with each movement the craft made.

407
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,800
No sound, no torque, no g-force, no inertia, end quote.

408
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,800
Now, of course, this passage material is interesting, but why do I bring this up?

409
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,800
Well, because the control scheme in this is the exact same sphere mechanism

410
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,800
primary witness Brad Sorenson and aerospace illustrator Mark McCandless

411
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,800
claimed the alien reproduction vehicle Fluxliners utilized.

412
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,800
See on screen Mark McCandless's drawing of the trackball used to control the flying saucer.

413
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Countless comparisons to the 1988 saucer ARV encounter have been made so far in this project.

414
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,800
Perhaps the Fluxliner and TR-3B are born of the same programs.

415
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,800
With disclosures as impactful and spellbinding as Fuchet's,

416
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,800
his story attracted a great deal of attention and controversy.

417
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,800
So, I'd briefly like to mention the contentious arguments that waged war against Fuchet in the early and mid-2010s.

418
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,800
This controversy is quite complex, and I have zero skin in this game,

419
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,800
so we will simply try and analyze the statements made criticizing and supporting Fuchet

420
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
in the story of the TR-3B.

421
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
Let us draw out a few key players here.

422
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Jeremy Rice, aka Alien Scientist.

423
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,800
David Hamilton, author of Secret Space Program, Andrew Johnson.

424
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,800
UFO researcher Dan Benkert and Master Sergeant Fuchet himself.

425
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,800
On his website, AlienScientist.com, Jeremy Rice posted some startling opinions on Fuchet

426
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,800
after discussing Edgar's autobiography and very real military documents.

427
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,800
Jeremy stated the TR-3B testimony was, quote,

428
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,800
information that has no technical value and was likely fabricated by Ed

429
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:14,800
in an effort to combine stories about the Nazi Bell device with the Belgian wave of triangular UFO sightings.

430
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,800
So that his story would be more believable to the UFO research community, end quote.

431
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,800
This claim was based off criticism of Ed stating the TR-3B utilized mercury-based plasma systems

432
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,800
alongside strong opinions after years of friendship with the Master Sergeant.

433
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:36,800
After meeting Edgar in 2009, Jeremy would view the veteran as a close friend and legitimate whistleblower for years, quote.

434
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,800
After having known Edgar Fuchet for the past four years,

435
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,800
I must say that he is one of the most deceitful and manipulative people that I have ever met personally, end quote.

436
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Jeremy would accuse this behavior as stemming from PTSD-driven rampant alcoholism.

437
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,800
Jeremy would even state Edgar claimed to have flown a TR-3B one night whilst intoxicated, however.

438
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,800
He provides no evidence or receipts of this statement.

439
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,800
Author Andrew Johnson, who conducted numerous interviews with Fuchet and formed a close friendship on the contrary,

440
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,800
spoke very highly of the man.

441
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,800
Positions against Edgar from Jeremy Rice and an individual known as David Hamilton

442
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:17,800
crutch on a few key points outside of what Jeremy viewed as a lack of compelling physics behind the TR-3B.

443
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,800
Faked military documents and a photo of the F-117A stealth fighter.

444
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,800
On an undisclosed date, Edgar sent Jeremy an image alleging to picture Fuchet alongside a crew

445
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,800
observing the F-117 prototype at Area 51 between 1977 and 1981.

446
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,800
Rice claimed Ed stole the photo from an article titled F-117A Senior Trend.

447
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,800
The photographer of this image would even respond, quote,

448
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,800
I cannot tell you who is in that photo, but I can tell you that Mr. Fuchet doesn't know what he is talking about, end quote.

449
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,800
My issue here is actually Jeremy's initial emails to the photographer Dan.

450
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,800
Alien scientist's email was overwhelmingly charged with leading statements against Edgar,

451
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,800
providing links to his full disclosures on TR-3B while stating, quote,

452
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,800
Ed has constructed a series of lies around this picture being and stationed at Groom Lake.

453
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,800
Many of us do not believe Ed at all, end quote.

454
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,800
This is not how one elicits an unbiased and objective response.

455
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:21,800
In 2013, YouTuber David Hilton posted a video titled Edgar Fuchet, Fake Documents,

456
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,800
which saw subsequent videos posted by Jeremy.

457
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,800
It is worth noting both of these projects have been unlisted and removed from YouTube.

458
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,800
Whether this is due to walking back the statements or to prevent further controversy, I am not sure.

459
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,800
Hilton constructed a group email with Jeremy Rise, Dan B, and Andrew Johnson,

460
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,800
author of Secret Program and supporter of Fuchet after a series of extensive interviews with the witness,

461
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,800
to discuss the video allegedly exposing Fuchet.

462
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,800
Hilton stated, quote, after knowing Ed on a personal level since February of 2012,

463
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,800
it is my opinion that he made up slash lied about everything.

464
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,800
I've caught him in so many lies and contradictions that I can't keep up with them all.

465
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,800
It's not really something that can be completely hashed out in an email, end quote.

466
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,800
This statement is rather shocking to me as alongside historical documents provided by Fuchet,

467
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:15,800
numerous documents highlighting Fuchet's military service were pried from Foya by Hilton himself.

468
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,800
While we cannot view this video or further context of Hilton claiming Fuchet as a liar,

469
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,800
we can analyze Edgar's response on the Outpost Forum in July of 2014.

470
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,800
Here, Edgar addressed the points Hilton seemingly made in his video.

471
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:35,800
By his response and defense of the documents, it appears Hilton attempted to address only small inconsistencies within the documents,

472
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:42,800
such as small indentations, variable pressure on letters, physical degradation of source documents and copies.

473
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,800
Due to Hilton and Rise retracting their video, I must conclude they conceded these claims against Fuchet.

474
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:55,800
Hilton additionally made some startling comments to the aforementioned Dan B in a June 2012 Skype conversation.

475
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,800
Now, Dan B is not to be confused with Dan Burish.

476
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,800
This is UFO researcher Dan Benkert, who has co-authored excellent work with Michael Schrat.

477
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,800
Benkert has been a staunch reporter of Fuchet after knowing him personally

478
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:13,800
and once offered a fascinating and worthy counter-explanation to a March 19, 2016 article titled,

479
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,800
Edgar Fuchet's TR3B is most likely a hoax.

480
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,800
Anyways, speaking to Dan B, Hilton would make some extremely startling remarks such as,

481
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,800
Actually, I work for an agency that monitors things you shouldn't do.

482
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,800
Go ahead and tell people they won't believe you.

483
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,800
And I now control Ed, not you.

484
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Funny how things work out, isn't it?

485
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,800
The exposure becomes a tool of control.

486
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:50,800
Historically, accounts of witnessing NHI craft or NHI crash retrievals contain uniform elements.

487
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,800
These craft and technologies of unknown origin seem almost perfect.

488
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:00,800
No seams, no rivets, no bolts, almost as if the craft are 3D printed.

489
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,800
Some of these craft feature entirely smooth bodies or what humans would describe as windows,

490
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,800
yet some of the craft often appear beautiful and perfect in appearance.

491
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,800
This is almost never seen in triangular craft sightings.

492
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
Let us analyze some of these cases.

493
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,800
They've been seen almost in every country by every possible culture.

494
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,800
So it's a worldwide phenomenon.

495
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,800
We've got a case over here of a red one with this exhaust port here.

496
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
We've got a case in Detroit.

497
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,800
We've got Belgium cases.

498
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:37,800
So a brief cross-section of these aircraft have been seen all around the world.

499
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:44,800
The primary features of these triangles, they usually have a white light on the corner of each of the triangle.

500
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,800
Some of these are between 200 and 300 feet across.

501
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,800
This mid-section is generally about 20 feet across.

502
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,800
And then there's always this interesting structural work on the bottom

503
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,800
and probably a red or amber light in the center of the bottom section of the craft.

504
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,800
That's kind of the overall view of what we see here.

505
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,800
Let's travel back to October 28, 1993 to Croton Falls, New York,

506
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:14,800
in the midst of the Hudson Valley UFO flap and analyze the testimony of Jim Cook.

507
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,800
Cook, a biomedical engineer, was driving to his Hudson River Valley home

508
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,800
when he encountered a truly bizarre craft.

509
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,800
Near the Croton Falls Reservoir, Cook spotted aircraft lights

510
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,800
approaching the water level dropping very fast.

511
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,800
The lights appeared to hover before blinking out.

512
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,800
Cook, walking out of his car to the shoreline,

513
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:38,800
spotted a triangular object hovering 200 feet away, 15 feet above the water.

514
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,800
Nine red lights appeared on the triangle side

515
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,800
and a red break of light from the underside began to probe the water.

516
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Now let's move to the year 2000 in the town of St. Clair in southern Illinois

517
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,800
where numerous small-town residents and police officers reported a triangular-shaped craft.

518
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:01,800
In the early morning of January 5th, police officers reported a UFO near Scott Air Force Base.

519
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:07,800
The craft was massive on a elongated black triangle, roughly 75 feet long and 40 feet wide.

520
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,800
At each corner sat a bright white light underwaving in luminosity.

521
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,800
One smaller flashing red light sat just below the object's midline near the rear two lights.

522
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,800
The back of the object appeared rectangular and illuminated in white light.

523
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,800
Through the middle of the light running lengthwise was a band of multi-colored illumination.

524
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,800
It was stated there were no individual colored lights visible.

525
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,800
Rather, it appeared as a band of various colors which blended into each other.

526
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,800
A second police officer reported the object heading in a westerly direction,

527
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,800
matching the description of initial reports.

528
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:47,800
This officer, Martin, added he believed the object to be maybe 75 to 100 yards in width at an altitude of 1,000 feet.

529
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:54,800
The object was estimated to travel at a loitering speed of 15 miles per hour before accelerating to 100 miles per hour.

530
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,800
Let's also jump to Madison, Wisconsin on November 22nd, 1985,

531
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,800
where multiple eyewitnesses described a triangular, dull, roughly 40 foot across craft.

532
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,800
Excellent researcher Michael Schrat extracted a quote from one of the eyewitnesses

533
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,800
who stated the underside of the craft resembled, quote,

534
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,800
the back of a refrigerator, like a collection of condensation pipes that ran back and forth, end quote.

535
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,800
One can't help but wonder here if this craft scene was an alien reproduction triangle

536
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,800
utilizing prototype propulsion systems requiring a massive heat exchanger apparatus.

537
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:35,800
Similar oddities can be observed in the United Kingdom's infamous sighting by Colin Saunders in March of 1999.

538
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,800
Saunders and his family, upon driving home from dinner,

539
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:44,800
observed a 50 foot long triangular shaped craft that pitched up and down at roughly a 15 degree angle.

540
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,800
Colin claimed the craft bobbed as if it were submerged in water.

541
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,800
The exterior of the craft was described as a flowing liquid mercury,

542
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,800
which reminds me closely of Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagan's UFO crash retrieval case,

543
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:03,800
in which Wagan observed a crashed UAP with skin described as the mother of pearl effect.

544
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:08,800
The top of the craft was not flat, but more angled with a strange raised pattern on top

545
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,800
Saunders believed to be some sort of docking mechanism with a larger craft.

546
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,800
And this same pattern existed on the underside of the craft.

547
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,800
Parasitic aircraft are not uncommon in human-made airplanes.

548
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:27,800
In fact, in the 1970s, Youssef proposed a Boeing 747 airborne aircraft carrier to house an array of fighter jets.

549
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,800
This sloping top also sounds very dissimilar from the TR-3B,

550
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,800
but may sound extremely similar to the craft we're about to discuss.

551
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,800
Analyzing the strange lights, fixtures, systems, and appearances of these triangles

552
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:47,800
seen throughout the 1980s to early 2000s, we must ask, were these craft human-made?

553
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,800
Were they prototypes or iterations of TR-3B?

554
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,800
Or were these all the result of separate legacy programs?

555
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,800
Or were these flying triangles somewhere in between?

556
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:09,800
This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.

557
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,800
Now, I know you don't believe that story, but just hear me out.

558
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,800
Now, Ellen's air base, the same base that we're at right now,

559
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,800
the same base that for some strange reason doesn't appear on your U.S. government map,

560
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,800
is supposedly one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.

561
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,800
Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs?

562
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,800
No. Planes built using UFO technology.

563
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,800
Fascinating lines of research fully independent of Huchet's TR-3B

564
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,800
leads to a very similar reverse-engineered triangular craft

565
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,800
known by disgruntled engineers as the XF-131 Super Sentinel.

566
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,800
Let's visit respected artist Bill McDonald,

567
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,800
an old-school freelance commercial illustrator,

568
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,800
concept designer, forensic reconstruction illustrator,

569
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,800
and current sworn law enforcement professional.

570
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,800
I have featured McDonald's work in multiple projects,

571
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,800
most notably his designs with Dr. Robert Wood of the extraterrestrial entities

572
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,800
known as EB-1 and EB-2,

573
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,800
described within the Majestic-12 Special Operations Manual,

574
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,800
as well as his fantastic work on the Roswell craft

575
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,800
and the 1976 Tehran-Iran UFO incident.

576
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,800
McDonald additionally featured in a fantastic four-part series

577
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:25,800
on Michael Schrat's YouTube channel titled Roswell Revisited.

578
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,800
I, myself, have had the pleasure of speaking with Mr. McDonald

579
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,800
and hold an extremely high opinion of him,

580
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,800
including speaking on the drawing and case we are about to discuss.

581
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,800
And here I present to you the beautiful piece titled

582
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,800
Tehachapi Triangle 1992.

583
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,800
McDonald met with four old engineers

584
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,800
at a denny's in Antelope Valley, California in the spring of 1992.

585
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,800
All four engineers, two from Northrop Grumman and two from Lockheed Martin,

586
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,800
were fed up with egregious security impositions

587
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,800
negatively impacting their lives.

588
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:04,800
All four engineers were subject to extreme project compartmentalization,

589
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,800
with each having a piece of the puzzle

590
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,800
for the name of the triangular craft Antelope Valley residents

591
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,800
had been reporting for numerous years,

592
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,800
the XF-131 Super Sentinel.

593
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,800
Each of these engineers wanted their story told without threats to their lives.

594
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,800
Jail time or stripping of pensions.

595
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,800
Does this sound familiar to anybody about the current state of UAP whistleblowers?

596
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,800
The four men had found each other over a number of decades

597
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:35,800
while being employed at various facilities surrounding the California high desert.

598
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,800
The two Northrop employees hailed from a facility called Tehan,

599
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,800
or Tehachapi Ranch by UFO researchers.

600
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,800
McDonald claims he was able to confirm this testimony through friends of his father

601
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,800
and his father's mentor Robert Scandrett,

602
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,800
who worked for Rock L International Strategic Systems Division.

603
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,800
The other two claimed to work for Ben Rich at Lockheed Skunkworks in Glendale, California

604
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,800
and worked the radar cross-section range known as Hellendale.

605
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,800
First off, let's quickly recall a similarity to TR-3B

606
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,800
when Fushay asked if Kelly Johnson was the senior project designer for TR-3B,

607
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,800
he responded, quote,

608
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,800
No, it would have been Ben Rich, end quote.

609
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:19,800
Second, the Hellendale facility located very closely to Edwards Air Force Base

610
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,800
in Palmdale, USAF Plant 42,

611
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,800
two locations I have directly accused of housing reverse engineering programs,

612
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,800
would later be accused by Steven Greer and others

613
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:34,800
as a currently ongoing black-budget deep-six UAP reverse engineering location.

614
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,800
Now, interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee

615
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,800
and other senior officials had no idea of this.

616
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:47,800
The top people in Special Forces who are outside this illegal black project system

617
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,800
didn't know about it.

618
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,800
I had known about it since the 90s,

619
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:56,800
but I'd never, of course, flown directly over it because it's classified or spaced and very sensitive.

620
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:03,800
So, you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.

621
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:11,800
It's just where the man-made UFOs that we've been building since the 1954-55 come out.

622
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,800
They go up and they hover.

623
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,800
They're silent.

624
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,800
They're electro-grabbitic, anti-grab.

625
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,800
The diamond on the left, you see, it looks like a runway with a diamond.

626
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,800
It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get, there's not an aerodynamic.

627
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,800
They just go boom, up.

628
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,800
But they're placed over different diamonds.

629
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,800
I have a whole series of video and pictures of these.

630
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,800
We don't have time to go through.

631
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:39,800
And that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon

632
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,800
to see if it's hard enough to withstand conflict, right?

633
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:50,800
Five years before Greer would first label the Lockheed Martin-Hellendale plant as a program location,

634
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,800
McDonald's stated the location was designed to be hidden in plain sight.

635
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,800
Utilizing the cover of a radar cross-section facility,

636
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,800
the location's exterior features a storm drainage flood control channel,

637
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:07,800
which allegedly truly serves as a short runway or platform for the testing of these craft.

638
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,800
And here is where things get very, very, very interesting.

639
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:16,800
As I mentioned earlier, I have spoken to McDonald about the XF-131

640
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,800
and he maintains the four engineers were indeed delivering true testimony.

641
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,800
I even asked for the individual's identities or leads on the case

642
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,800
so I might contact and interview them myself.

643
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,800
He has sworn to protect their identities.

644
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:34,800
In the Teha Chape triangle drawing, McDonald exclaimed if viewers recognize the craft,

645
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,800
Fox Network contracted McDonald's work and made a computer render of the vehicle

646
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:45,800
for the first regular season episode of the X-Files in the episode titled Deep Throat.

647
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,800
This fantastic episode, probably my favorite of the whole series,

648
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,800
follows the main characters investigating the disappearance of a USAF test pilot.

649
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:58,800
A mysterious informant tells one of the lead investigators, Mulder, to stay away from the case.

650
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,800
Utilizing research and testimony I played at the beginning of this section,

651
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:07,800
Mulder learned that the craft, the Super Sentinel, was a reverse engineered craft

652
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,800
from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico case.

653
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,800
Investigating the airfield late at night, a triangular shaped craft

654
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:18,800
darts and hovers over Mulder before rapidly speeding away.

655
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:41,800
Music

656
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:47,800
Mulder is then captured by Air Force personnel and given a cocktail to forget about what he saw,

657
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,800
but not before he caught a glimpse of the craft in a hangar.

658
01:02:51,800 --> 01:03:06,800
Music

659
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,800
Rumors persist of the X-Files screenwriter, Chris Carter,

660
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,800
mentioning he had been approached by unknown military brass who asked how he knew so much.

661
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,800
However, I can find no credible sources here,

662
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:24,800
but what I can find is referenced paranormal writer and 25 year FBI investigator veteran

663
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,800
and inspiration for much of the X-Files, John DeSousa.

664
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,800
In 2023, DeSousa put out a video on YouTube titled,

665
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:38,800
John DeSousa, 25 year veteran of FBI, John DeSousa is exposing the truth of the UAP invasion.

666
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:43,800
And while I voraciously disagree with the Project Bluebeam fake invasion narrative,

667
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:48,800
DeSousa does make some very interesting remarks directly stating the first season of the X-Files

668
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,800
was based off true cases he investigated.

669
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:57,800
The craziest one that I'm still not supposed to talk about,

670
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:07,800
but I can say that it was featured in the first episode of the X-Files

671
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,800
or maybe it was the second of the first season.

672
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:16,800
By the way, they used my stories during the first season of the X-Files

673
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:21,800
and then after that they went to other, they no longer used my cases.

674
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:28,800
However, the rest of the X-Files was all based on true stories as well.

675
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:42,800
However, I would say the craziest UFO, the craziest paranormal case was when I was sent to a military base.

676
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,800
I can say in general terms, I was sent to a military base,

677
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:54,800
we observed a military base where they had had several disappearances

678
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:00,800
that were associated with the appearance of UFOs in the area.

679
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:05,800
And there were UFOs that the military base said, the commander said,

680
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,800
I don't know what to do with this, I'm at my wits end.

681
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:18,800
And so we went to observe these UFOs that had been coming to the outskirts of this military base.

682
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,800
And on a regular basis, and they were filled with light.

683
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,800
They were filled with light, almost like they didn't even appear metal anymore.

684
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,800
And they would just come to the edge of this forest.

685
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:36,800
And there was a group of people who would just do a regular observance of these things.

686
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:41,800
And so myself and my partner, we went and we were with those people.

687
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:51,800
And for some reason, one of the UFOs picked us out for some reason and came directly at us, came directly at us.

688
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,800
And just, it appeared to land on us at some point.

689
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,800
All the people ran, everyone ran, including us.

690
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:04,800
But it appeared to land on us, but then it didn't because it disappeared somehow.

691
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:14,800
And then we had people from the base who took me in, who took me in against my will.

692
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:21,800
They took me in and they interrogated me as to what my knowledge was of the UFOs.

693
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:28,800
It is endlessly fascinating, Chris Carter of the X-Files specifically contracted McDonald's Tehachapi Triangle,

694
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:34,800
an allegedly real reverse engineered ARV for an episode based on true events.

695
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:39,800
This case is seen further investigation for myself behind the scenes.

696
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,800
It's been insanely busy. So I appreciate everybody sticking by me.

697
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,800
Please look forward to the Jesse Michaels interview or kind of project and the Eric Davis interview,

698
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,800
which I think everybody will find fascinating.

699
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,800
I'll probably use clips from an every single project I do from now on here coming shortly.

700
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,800
So let's kind of break down what we discussed today.

701
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:25,800
I for one was super excited to take on this project because I think whenever people think of triangular shaped UAP to ARV to anything,

702
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,800
they associate it with TR3B.

703
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:33,800
And a lot of the time people don't really know the full story of Edgar Fouchet and kind of the story behind TR3B.

704
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:41,800
I know when getting kind of B-roll and footage and images for this video, quite often the X-F131 Super Sentinel, the TR3A,

705
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:46,800
and another craft called the TR3E are often confused for TR3B.

706
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:54,800
Now, the reason I didn't cover TR3E is this is often used as kind of a toy model based off recovered,

707
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,800
based off reverse engineered craft.

708
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,800
And I have actually talked to some artists who have drawn this TR3E.

709
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,800
For those of you kind of listening right now saying what the heck is he talking about?

710
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:10,800
This is the triangle design that almost has sort of a concave lines in between the vertexes with kind of fins and grates similar to the TR3B

711
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,800
and a smallish dome on top.

712
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:20,800
So maybe we'll visit TR3E at this time, but I didn't see too much evidence or worthwhile study here.

713
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,800
So I know sort of the breakdown of these craft can be quite complex.

714
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,800
So let's just go through that real fast.

715
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:34,800
On one hand, we have X-F131 Super Sentinel, which varies greatly to the TR3B and other triangular designs due to the almost pyramid shape on top

716
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,800
that is most similar to the 1999 Kirby England Sighting.

717
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,800
And on this side, we have the Aurora program, let's just say.

718
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,800
Within Aurora, there's codename Astra, which is the TR3B.

719
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:54,800
Astra is standing for Advanced Stealth Technology Reconnaissance Aircraft, and the TR and TR3B is standing for Tactical Reconnaissance.

720
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:02,800
The TR3B is the reverse engineered craft that is gravity resistant with companies such as Sandia, Lawrence Livermore,

721
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,800
Lockheed, and Northrop spearheaded by CIA, NSA, et cetera, et cetera.

722
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:11,800
Also in that same Aurora program, possibly, is the TR3A,

723
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:18,800
which may use advanced stealth concepts and advanced concepts such as electrogravitics for internal mass reduction,

724
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,800
or something like pulse detonation engines.

725
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:26,800
But let's remember that this craft is generally considered more prosaic with a cockpit and so forth,

726
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,800
and this may have been what crashed at Boscombe down in 1994.

727
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:34,800
So there's the TR3A, the TR3B, and possibly the TR3E.

728
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:40,800
Remember what Fuchet said? He said there's a whole host of craft in the TR, the tactical reconnaissance line,

729
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,800
just the same with the strategic reconnaissance, the SR line.

730
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:55,800
You know, there's the SR71, and Fuchet alleged that at least concepts of an SR74 and 75 were in development while he worked within the defense world and so forth.

731
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:07,800
So I almost find the description that Ed gives of DARCE and other kind of contractors almost more interesting than the TR3B itself.

732
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:14,800
For example, looking at his FOIA Pride documents and seeing the AFFTC, the Air Force Flight Test Center,

733
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:23,800
is really critical for me to be able to analyze this story and start to relay this to other stories or other investigation I've done.

734
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:35,800
You know, him talking about Project Redlight with EGNG for the DOE while EGNG runs Area 51, we can also see that Sandia and I think it's Lawrence Livermore were partners for NEST,

735
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:39,800
Nuclear Emergency Search teams or something like that, but NEST teams.

736
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:44,800
So there's all these delicious little tie-ins, especially when Fuchet mentions treats.

737
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:50,800
As we saw, there's one mention publicly available of treat I could possibly find.

738
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,800
And this could be the Army inscom under Stubblebind's version of the Men in Black.

739
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:04,800
But you know, sticking to the video topic, I don't know enough about the physics of TR3B to kind of dispute the craft like Jeremy Rice does.

740
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:11,800
And speaking of that, guys, I'm not looking to get involved in any drama or throw my hat in the ring and defend or criticize Fuchet.

741
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:23,800
I simply thought it important to when you have disclosures as impactful and key as Fuchet is to say, hey, there have been individuals who have brought up issues with certain things he's done.

742
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:31,800
And I just thought it important to relay those and kind of throw in my opinion of what I thought about some of the criticisms.

743
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,800
I'm not really trying to get involved or squabble with any of the players still active.

744
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,800
So just know that. I do that in good faith by just kind of talking about the arguments.

745
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,800
So TR3B XF131 Super Sentinel.

746
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:51,800
TR3B, there's 200 foot test models and 600 foot operational models.

747
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:59,800
The description of the craft down to the diffuse red light on the bottom is very similar to what numerous people have relayed seen.

748
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:09,800
I mean, I'll scroll through any YouTube video of a triangle sighting or I'll talk to anybody at Jujitsu and they'll all say that, yeah, I've had a UFO sighting or my uncle or somebody I know did.

749
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,800
They saw a triangle that three right white lights and a red one.

750
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,800
These sort of sightings seem almost ubiquitous.

751
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,800
They seem very common.

752
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:27,800
And then there's something like the XF131 Super Sentinel whose size is much smaller, whose underside is far more intriguing with the, you know,

753
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:32,800
we didn't really dive into the physics for the engineering because that information is unavailable to myself.

754
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:42,800
But with a large light that seems almost maneuverable on bottom, followed by three pairs of lights kind of on each side of the triangle.

755
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,800
I hope everybody enjoyed seeing that in X files.

756
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,800
I myself am kind of a new X files fan.

757
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:56,800
So I've seen that episode and watching Mulder kind of pursue this subject about the Air Force test pilots who have gone missing.

758
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:02,800
Just to encounter the triangle, which was reverse engineered from technology at Roswell is so intriguing to me.

759
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:11,800
I myself put a lot of weight on both Fuchet and the TR3B as well as the XF131 Super Sentinel.

760
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:24,800
I have been and will continue to be investigating that specific craft and that specific story as it is just extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely intriguing to myself.

761
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,800
But I do want to know what everybody thought about TR3B.

762
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:38,800
You know, after analyzing the full extent to which Fuchet gave testimony, I don't think his story is as simple as, hey, he saw the Belgian UFO wave and he's trying to glom on.

763
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,800
I just, I don't think it's as simple as that.

764
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:53,800
Now, the most valid criticism of Ed is besides his three sightings, which were not under program operations, he did not work firsthand on the TR3B.

765
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:58,800
Much of this information was relayed from Gerald, from Bud, from Doc, from Sal, and so forth.

766
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,800
So he is ultimately relaying secondhand information.

767
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:15,800
Now, of course, Gerald died pretty soon after their first meeting, but if any of these other gentlemen are still around, Fuchet has not, he has passed and can share this information, please reach out to me.

768
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:31,800
Let's kind of, let's discuss this a little more because the way I see things right now is that there's likely not one, at least two types of ARV that DOD, the Air Force, 412 test group and legacy programs have.

769
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:40,800
This is something like the flux liner, the flying saucer craft that either operates off of electrogravity, magneto hydrodynamics, or zero point energy systems.

770
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:51,800
And then there's something a little less pretty in the triangles, and these likely operate off of electrogravity or MFD devices, MHD devices, as Fuchet talked about.

771
01:14:51,800 --> 01:15:00,800
You know, the triangles are not, are not capable of what we would assume NHI and what we analyze NHI craft are capable of with the six observables.

772
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:07,800
Fuchet will talk about the TR3B doing impossible maneuvers, right turns that are very close to actual right turns.

773
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:17,800
However, the speed limitations of this craft and so forth, all of these things, the internal and nervosal dampening, none of these things are too extreme.

774
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:30,800
And this is one of the things that stuck out to me about the flux liner as well, you know, the F4 Phantom jump sheet seats, the off the shelf components with this really interesting reverse engineered or copied propulsion system.

775
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:40,800
The TR3B and the triangles, the, you know, the XF131 Super Sentinel to extent seem very similar, that it's a human attempt to reproduce something fantastic.

776
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,800
Now, what are the NHI triangles?

777
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:51,800
Why, if it's true, did Psalm 101 in 1954 say that these triangles are new and little is known about them?

778
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:57,800
You know, we can start to analyze the, the triangle programs in the 80s, 90s, possibly even earlier in the 70s.

779
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:06,800
But, you know, in the 50s, these triangles, are they NHI or are they a breakaway civilizations, a precursor to programs?

780
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,800
These questions still exist.

781
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,800
These questions are super interesting.

782
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:18,800
How many prototypes of TR3B or XF131 Super Sentinel are possibly these triangles are called something else completely that we are none the wiser to.

783
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:25,800
How many prototypes were they, you know, the heat exchangers underneath the pyramid shaped top and Kirby England as a docking mechanism.

784
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,800
These sightings in southern Illinois with these interesting strips of lights.

785
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:38,800
The triangles are fascinating for the era reporting trends of triangles comprising one to four percent.

786
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:44,800
You would be astonished at how many people have reported seen triangle triangular shaped craft.

787
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,800
So I'm chewing up a lot of time here, guys.

788
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,800
I'm just so excited to be back.

789
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,800
I'd like to thank everybody for watching and we are back to our regular regularly scheduled programming.

790
01:16:53,800 --> 01:17:01,800
Thank you all so much for joining me into this look into Fushay, into TR3B, into flying triangles, into ARB.

791
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,800
I'll catch everybody next time.

792
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,800
Thank you so much.

793
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,800
Bye.
