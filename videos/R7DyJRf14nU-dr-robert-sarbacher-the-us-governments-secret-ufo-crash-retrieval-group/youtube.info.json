    "description": "A deep dive into the claims and connections of one Doctor Robert Sarbacher; physicist, student of Einstein, and consultant to the US DOD Research & Development Board. In 1950, Canadian Senior Engineer Wilburt B. Smith Kicked off Canada's first official investigations into UFOs based on 4 key points a source in Washington, Sarbacher Relayed to him. These points stated that the study of very real UFOs was classified even higher than the H Bomb within the USG and that a small group studied the phenomenon spearheaded by Dr. Vannevar Bush.\n\nA look into Sarbacher leads to MANY bizarre roads including attempts to track UAP with German V-2 rockets, connections to MJ-12, a possibility of Oppenheimer being involved in UFO study, and the first meetings of UFO crash retrievals occurring in 1949/1950.\n\nSarbacher mentions one member who attended this meeting, former Penn State President Eric A. Walker. Walker confirmed himself he attended the meeting and warned various researchers to pursue the phenomenon. Walker also made incredibly interesting remarks on the Majestic-12 AND stated himself he observed the alleged 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO Crash. \n\n0:00 Intro\n1:44 Doctor Sarbacher\n3:07 Germna V-2 Rocket\n4:58 Wilbert B.
