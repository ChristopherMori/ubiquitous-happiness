1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
It didn't start or end with Roswell.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,140
The 20th century of the United States saw several now infamous alleged UFO crash cases

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,180
that feature rich paper trails, a wealth of witnesses, and endless mystery.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,260
Today we travel to the Midwest of the continental United States to a sleepy town in Pennsylvania

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,740
named Kecksburg.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,620
We're on the evening of December 9th, 1965, something from the sky crashed into the nearby

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,840
woods, sending the town and the U.S. military into a frenzy, leading to one of the most

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,740
discussed and debated UFO crash retrieval cases of all time.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,420
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb.

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,880
Today we finally visit one of my most requested crash retrieval cases, the 1965 Kecksburg

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,100
Pennsylvania UFO crash.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,380
Kecksburg has long been a favorite case in life due to the exhausting lists of local

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,660
witnesses, extensive press coverage, and fascinating ties to Blue Book and Project

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,660
Moondust.

15
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,220
What, if anything, crashed into the woods that cold winter evening.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,540
Was it a meteor as Blue Book claimed, a Soviet satellite like many debunkers have claimed,

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,540
or indeed a craft of non-human intelligence as described by numerous eyewitnesses?

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,180
In a quick note here guys, excellent research has been conducted by respected ufologists

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,380
on this case.

20
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,260
I will primarily be referencing the work of the most seasoned Kecksburg investigator

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,380
Stan Gordon and the legend with whom Gordon shared much of his research and witnesses,

22
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,420
Leonard Stringfield.

23
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,580
In the early evening of December 9th, 1965, thousands of residents across Michigan, Indiana,

24
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,220
Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, and Canada observed a fiery brilliant glow

25
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,580
streak across the sky, a ball of fire leaving a smoke trail, estimated to be visible for

26
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,940
20 minutes after the passing of the object.

27
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,980
Numerous ground-based civilians and pilots initially thought the object to be an aircraft

28
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,620
in peril, especially due to pieces of the object seemingly detaching and falling over

29
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,460
Lapeer, Michigan, and Alleria, Ohio.

30
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,780
The material would later be recognized and studied within the official Blue Book report

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,060
on Kecksburg.

32
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,380
As noted by Clark McClelland, UFO researcher and former NASA Apollo space program member,

33
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,860
as well as Dr. Paul Anir, professor of astronomy, the object would make a change of course roughly

34
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,900
25 degrees when traveling over Alleria, Ohio.

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,380
Similar calculations showed the object to be between 40 and 60 miles in altitude when

36
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,340
first observed over Michigan.

37
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,860
McClelland estimated the speed of the glowing object based on the distance of witness observations

38
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,260
to be traveling at roughly 17 miles per minute or 1,062 miles per hour.

39
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,500
For reference, meteors traveled between 25 and 144,000 miles an hour, so even if McClelland's

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,940
calculations were off by a factor of 10, the object was still traveling at much slower

41
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,140
speeds than a meteor in Earth's atmosphere.

42
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,740
Around 4.45 pm, the object plunged into the woods of Kecksburg, Pennsylvania.

43
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,820
The object made a turn between Greensburg and La Trobe and was reported from local communities

44
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,760
as it moved towards the south.

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,980
Near Laurelville, the object turned again and began to track northeast towards the Kecksburg

46
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,300
area where it reportedly impacted into the woods.

47
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,340
Closely tracking the object, Project Blue Book dispatched a three-man Air Force team

48
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,940
from the 662nd Radar Squadron at the Oakdale Army installation near Pittsburgh to investigate.

49
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,500
The squadron was operating under control of the Aerospace Defense Command.

50
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,060
These orders were presumably given by Major Hector Quintanilla, who took the reins of Blue

51
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,060
Book in 1963.

52
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,520
The 33-page report on Kecksburg from Blue Book has Quintanilla's name all over the

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,940
memorandum for record, and it is important to note of Blue Book's conclusion of Kecksburg.

54
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,460
Under the major, the case was designated as a meteor.

55
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,340
And quickly worth mentioning, Blue Book states the three-man team found no materials at the

56
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
crash site.

57
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,300
Blue Book curiously marks this case under ACME, Pennsylvania.

58
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,780
Why is this?

59
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,520
Researchers are not sure, but one possibility is the Air Force personnel interviewed witnesses

60
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,340
who lived nearby in the town of ACME.

61
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,420
And speaking of Quintanilla, let's pay special attention to April 5, 1966, where the United

62
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,020
States Air Force Major lied before the House Armed Services Committee, stating that Blue

63
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,460
Book had no radar cases that were unexplained.

64
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,580
Scientific advisor to Blue Book, J. Allen Heineck, revealed this deception by providing

65
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:37,340
three such cases, 1951 Goose Bay, 1956 Lakinheath, and 1957 Shrevaport.

66
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,460
Although town residents argue to this day over what crashed in the woods that night,

67
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,180
the town witnesses agree within an hour of the impact military forces swarmed the area

68
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,580
almost as quickly as the arrival of Penn State Police and the Kecksburg Volunteer Fireman.

69
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,900
Twenty-eight years, I'm a fireman here at Kecksburg.

70
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,820
It does me good as a young, old fireman now that now we know that something did happen.

71
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,340
The military was here.

72
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,060
Everybody here is correct in what they've seen and what they heard.

73
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,820
I think because of the lay of the land and the terrain, there was different points of

74
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,500
vision from wherever they were at that point.

75
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,660
The outcome of our town meeting, a majority consensus that something big did happen in

76
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,580
Kecksburg on December 9th, 1965, and that despite the official report to the contrary,

77
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,060
soldiers were on site.

78
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,420
Regardless of USAF and Blue Book denying a presence of more than three men at Kecksburg,

79
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,060
a statement that will later be contradicted by Dr. Eric A. Walker, Kecksburg residents

80
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,460
gave descriptions of multiple types of military men, US Army soldiers equipped with M1 rifles,

81
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,820
USAF personnel with blue fatigues and blue berets, and men in civilian clothing seemingly

82
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,140
barking out orders and some witnesses even described men in hazmat suits labelling them

83
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,020
as moon suits.

84
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,380
There are also myriad local press articles like these from the Pittsburgh Press on December

85
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,220
10th that also contradict the military's denial of a presence at Kecksburg.

86
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,340
The description of Air Force men may be paramount to investigating this crash recovery case.

87
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,980
Referred to as blue berets, Leonard Stringfield made numerous mentions to a UFO crash recovery

88
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,420
intelligence team stemming from the Air Force donned in blue fatigues and blue berets.

89
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,140
In crash retrievals of the third kind, a case study of alleged UFOs and occupants in military

90
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,140
custody.

91
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,580
Stringfield stated he had been made aware from other military forces of a rapid reaction

92
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,220
special forces unit named blue berets who can quote, operate secretly and effectively

93
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,540
by using diversionary tactics to prevent public interference, end quote.

94
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,500
This unit was housed at certain military bases as rapid reaction units in a constant state

95
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,460
of ready to address downed or crashed UFOs.

96
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,220
Stringfield even stated to have met a former member of the elite blue berets when visiting

97
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,660
the University of Dade City, Florida for a lecture quote.

98
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,040
We talked about the elite force, its makeup and functions and some of his experiences

99
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,740
in Vietnam behind enemy lines.

100
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,820
Although he had never participated in a UFO crash retrieval, he was aware that one of

101
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,740
his fellow members had the experience.

102
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,220
Details were scanty, but Cameron calls that his friend referred to his participation in

103
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,780
the recovery of a quote unquote big head from an alien craft and quote.

104
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,820
In UFO crash retrieval status report for fatal encounters at Fort Dix, McGuire Stringfield

105
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,580
met with a man named Jeff Morse who claimed to be a former blue beret.

106
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,940
Morse would tell Stringfield in 1985 to 1987 about an incident at Fort McGuire Air Force

107
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,940
Base in which a non-human entity was shot to death by US forces.

108
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,220
Quite a bit to discuss about the blue berets, so maybe we will save that for another video.

109
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,060
But I do want to mention Air Force blue berets were made famous with the creation of the

110
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:00,380
USAF 1041 security police squadron, which operated during 1965 to 1967.

111
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:06,140
The 1041s and their blue berets were implemented in Operation Safe Side in which the Air Force

112
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:12,440
deployed a highly trained unit of combat security police known as active defense to repel raids

113
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,480
on air bases in Vietnam.

114
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,420
But the origins of USAF personnel and blue fatigues and blue berets can be traced back

115
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,780
to 1956 with the creation of the strategic air command elite guard under General Curtis

116
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,140
LeMay, who I've spoken about many times.

117
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:33,580
The SAC elite guards operated as air police from 1956 to 1966 within the time of our Kecksburg

118
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,860
case, serving as part of the US Air Force and US Department of Defense.

119
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,180
The blue beret SAC elite guard were tasked with providing security at headquarters of

120
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,900
strategic air command of the US Air Force.

121
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,180
One such SAC base is Lockbourne Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio.

122
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,420
Remember the mention of this base as we will later discuss a witness who claimed to have

123
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,780
briefly guarded the crashed UAP from Kecksburg at Lockburn AFB.

124
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,700
Let's get back to Kecksburg and analyze the events around the time of an object crashing

125
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,940
in the woods.

126
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,940
With news media starting to swirl about stories of a fireball crashing in the area, local

127
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,620
news director John Murphy out of WHJB Greensburg, Pennsylvania received a call from a startled

128
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,340
mother who claimed she and her children had observed a fiery object fall into the woods

129
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,860
where a cloud of blue smoke began rising after impact.

130
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,380
Murphy, a key player in this story moving forward, arrived to the woods and investigated

131
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:59,020
the scene for some time before Carl Metz, a state police fire marshal, and another investigator

132
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,740
arrived to the scene.

133
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,180
The two investigators entered the woods and upon returning and being questioned by Murphy,

134
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,140
told Murphy, quote, you better get your information from the army, end quote.

135
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,820
Murphy would then arrive to the state police barracks in Greensburg for more information,

136
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,420
where he observed army and Air Force men swarming the location.

137
00:10:44,820 --> 00:11:08,340
Murphy would interview many town residents about what they saw and experienced in Kecksburg

138
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,220
the evening of December 9th, and excitedly pieced together a radio documentary titled

139
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,900
Object in the Woods.

140
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,660
Curiously, Murphy's wife and other WHJB employees would state Murphy was approached

141
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,940
by men at the station leading to a radical alteration of his program.

142
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,700
Murphy would broadcast a heavily censored version of his documentary, starting the event

143
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,260
with an odd disclaimer.

144
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:57,100
And state that many witnesses whose testimony had been taped no longer wish to air their

145
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:14,460
statements due to fear of reprisals from the U.S. Army.

146
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:43,140
Stan Gordon would even go so far as to state he had received notarized documents from station

147
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,980
employees, claiming USG elements were confiscating news tapes of eyewitness accounts and were

148
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,540
not allowing said account to be broadcasted.

149
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,820
John Murphy would tragically die in a hit and run incident shortly after the event,

150
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,660
and never claimed publicly to have entered the woods and to have seen what crashed in

151
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,980
Kecksburg.

152
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,580
But in 2003, John's wife claimed he had told her of entering the woods and witnessed

153
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,780
a strange metallic object on the ground.

154
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,620
What was this object observed by so many and that later witnesses would state was transported

155
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,660
out of the woods in the early morning of December 10th by army trucks covered by a tarp.

156
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:29,180
Fortunately, we have numerous witness testimony to analyze.

157
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,020
There was no tail section, there was no motors, there was no windows, there was no doors.

158
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,700
There was big enough for a grown person to stand up in.

159
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,780
It had like Egyptian writing, like backwards writing on it, stars and circles and dashes

160
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,420
and lines and things like that.

161
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,620
It looked like an acorn.

162
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,620
It was really weird.

163
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,380
A first hand witness questioned at length by both Stan Gordon and Leonard Stringfield

164
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,420
is James, often referred to as Jim Romansky.

165
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,660
Romansky served as a volunteer fireman whose company was dispatched to Kecksburg to assist

166
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,580
with the search of what was thought to be a downed aircraft.

167
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,900
Romansky first approached Gordon in 1987 to tell his story.

168
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,780
He had previously feared ridicule for years, but wanted to finally give his testimony.

169
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:18,100
On the night of 1965, with the search teams combing the woods, Romansky heard via walkie

170
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,100
talkie the crash site had been discovered.

171
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,060
Upon arriving to the scene, the fireman witnessed an object half buried in the ground.

172
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,580
This object appeared to have descended into the forest at a 30 degree angle, breaking

173
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,140
tree limbs before impacting the ground and leaving a 25 foot long trench.

174
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,540
There were no signs of fire in the area.

175
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,260
I want you to describe what you saw when you arrived in this field where the supposed downed

176
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,260
aircraft was.

177
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,860
Well, first of all, we were in a field hunting for it as downed aircraft and the first rescue

178
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,140
team already found it and radioed into the fire hall, gave the coordinates and it was

179
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,340
down in front of us and we high-tailed it out of our search area and went down into

180
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,340
there.

181
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:07,660
And we got there expecting a smashed up airplane, wings, fuselage, etc., no such character.

182
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,460
Came down into the woods and here's its humongous piece of metal laying there.

183
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:18,100
I mean this thing, I've described time and time again as a very large, egg-corn shaped

184
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,860
object.

185
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,380
The front of it, or I presume was the front of it, was pushed down into the dirt where

186
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,060
the way it came in and landed after it took out the top of the trees and brush and everything

187
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,940
coming in.

188
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,220
Came back in an oblong shape, around the bottom was what I call a bumper and then the bottom

189
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,340
was perfectly flat, no signs of propulsion or anything.

190
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,100
There was no doors, no windows, there was no ways of getting in this thing, at least

191
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,500
none that I've seen.

192
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,980
There was no seams on it, no rivets, nothing.

193
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,340
The only thing I've seen was this bumper around it and had these real strange markings

194
00:15:52,340 --> 00:16:00,340
on it which I've often referred to as similar to the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

195
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:07,260
So as a volunteer fireman we did what we were supposed to do, find the crash site, do a preliminary

196
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,020
investigation for survivors who treated anybody which we didn't because there was none that

197
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,020
we could see.

198
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,180
There was no way of getting into this object.

199
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,180
The object appeared to be a large metallic acorn or bell measuring 10 to 12 feet in length,

200
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,100
8 to 10 feet in diameter.

201
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,780
The raised ring area measured about 8 to 10 inches wide.

202
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:29,820
The wingless, seamless and rivetless object was described as Romansky as a bronze off

203
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,340
gold color.

204
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,700
As a seasoned machinist, Romansky stated the object almost looked like it had been made

205
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,300
from a liquid metal mold and told researcher Stan Gordon, quote, never in my life have

206
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,540
I seen the color of that metal in any shape or form, end quote.

207
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,220
The presence of the described hieroglyphic writing has been a point of contention for

208
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,700
the Kecksburg case.

209
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,980
With some believing the object to be a Soviet space capsule and the writing to be Russian

210
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,420
Cyrillic, Romansky described the writing as quote, characters of broken and straight

211
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,940
lines, dots, rectangles and circles, end quote.

212
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,100
Romansky would even explicitly state to Leonard Stringfield, he was familiar with the Russian

213
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,820
language and the markings he observed were not Russian.

214
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:19,300
My dad is originally from Kiev and I went to him one time and I said, dad, I says you

215
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,620
could read and write Polish and Russian, he says, yeah, I said, write me something in

216
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,620
both dialects.

217
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
He says, what?

218
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,980
I said, just write me anything.

219
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,420
The Polish and Russian writing that I seen doesn't come nowhere near.

220
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,980
I think it imperative to include much of Jim's testimony on the 1993 Montell-William show

221
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,100
due to his fiery and passionate demeanor and discussion of how his presence at the Kecksburg

222
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,460
case affected his children's time in the U.S. armed services.

223
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,020
The first team had already radioed in his position, were there 10, 15 minutes all talking

224
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,500
around doing a preliminary search, wondering what we discovered.

225
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:04,140
Two gentlemen come down through the woods, trench coats on, ramrod stiff, crew cut, alright,

226
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,500
this is a restricted area.

227
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
You're not ordered to get out of here, oh wait a minute, I'm a civilian.

228
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,100
You ain't going to order me nothing, but as a fireman I'm being relieved from what I'm

229
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
doing.

230
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
So I got out of there.

231
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,060
We're going out through the woods, we didn't go no more to 15, 20 feet, and I know from

232
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:27,060
me to you, here come the military, full uniforms, equipment, marching right down through the

233
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,060
woods with a flashlight.

234
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,940
This is December, late in the evening, it's cold, it's wet.

235
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,740
How far away were you from a military base?

236
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Well, the closest base that I knew of was Pittsburgh, which is approximately 45 miles

237
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,740
to the west.

238
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,060
So, within 15 minutes of your arrival at the site, the military was there.

239
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
You got it.

240
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,860
Okay, alright, alright, now what did they say to you after this happened?

241
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,060
I mean, I know there were several members, the report I saw on Unsolved Mysteries, several

242
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,740
members of the community were there, right, other people were part of the community were

243
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,660
there and present and were all told to leave.

244
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,420
There was no press or media at the immediate crash site.

245
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:09,300
What I didn't know up on top of the hill, because I'd come in through the side, the

246
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:15,060
military had taken over a farmhouse, I mean from what I understand, military brass.

247
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:22,060
They took over up there, did all their orders and whatever they were doing from up there

248
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,540
and that's where I presume that the military who came down through the woods came from

249
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,060
because when we went out, we had to walk back to the fire hall, which was approximately

250
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,460
the way we had to go, I'd say a good mile, but by the time we got back to the fire hall,

251
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,940
it was wall to wall military, I mean there was trucks and jeeps and cars, there was guards

252
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,940
on the door.

253
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,420
Anybody said to you, I don't want you talking about this, don't say a word about this or

254
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:53,460
what they did, what they did, I mean these people virtually told us just to shut up,

255
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,660
get to your vehicles and be quiet.

256
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,500
I have a daughter and a son that both went into the military, within the last two or

257
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
three years.

258
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,220
One went into the Marine Corps, one went into U.S. Air Force.

259
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,500
My daughter come to me from the United States Marine Corps and she said, Dad, your name

260
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,540
can come up on a computer as my father, I had to sign a statement saying I would never

261
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,220
ask a request for any information from Kecksburg, my son had to sign two statements.

262
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,220
About you, about yourself?

263
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Pardon?

264
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,420
Any information about yourself?

265
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,260
Your daughter had to sign a paper that says she would not ask for any information about

266
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,260
you?

267
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,220
Not about me, but about Kecksburg, because my name would come up as her father.

268
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
Okay, but you know what?

269
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,860
Then, no wait a minute Montel, then my son in the U.S. Air Force had to sign two papers.

270
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,340
Jim, wait, get to, just jump to the chase, because part of the chase here is the fact

271
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,340
that I spent, I'm telling you, I had some of the highest clearances this country has

272
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
to offer.

273
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,540
I've been through files on top of files on top of files, I still ain't seen nothing

274
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,540
yet.

275
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,540
Period.

276
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Period.

277
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
Period.

278
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,540
You didn't have the need to know.

279
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
Yeah, but that's also not true.

280
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,660
Now my son goes in the Air Force and they tell him he can't even request to go to Wright

281
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,980
Patterson Air Force base for duty, because I seen something and that's where my UFO was

282
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,980
sent today.

283
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,900
Maybe his M.O.S. was something that they didn't have a qualification for it, right

284
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,900
pattern.

285
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
His M.O.S. has nothing to do with it.

286
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,900
Okay, all right, hold on a minute.

287
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,180
The government is covering this up, they don't want no one to know, they don't want no one

288
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,980
to get access to anything, because they're afraid people will find out the truth.

289
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,300
During his time spent with Stan Gordon, Romansky would take the researcher to the exact site

290
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,620
of the crash.

291
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,900
This site would line up identically to the description of our next witness, Bill Bullybush,

292
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,020
due to the best of our knowledge had no interaction with Romansky.

293
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,300
Bill Bullybush was driving his car in the afternoon of December 9th, 1965, where he observed

294
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,980
the object streaking over the sky.

295
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,300
Bill stated, quote, the object appeared to hesitate over the Loraville area, then made

296
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,580
a turn and then began to travel northeast towards Kecksburg, end quote, where he then

297
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,420
saw it descending.

298
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,020
Witnessing the object's descent, Bill turned his car and went to the top of the hill now

299
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,900
called Meteor Road, where he observed blue lights flashing in the woods.

300
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,180
As the sky was getting dark, Bullybush claimed to walk into the woods to the crash site, where

301
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,940
he looked upon a metallic acorn shaped object embedded into the soil.

302
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,460
The object featured the same strange writing noticed by Romansky, and Bullybush noted blue

303
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:29,940
arcing light emanating from the object at intervals.

304
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,940
Bullybush's description of the object supports the theory that it was probably not a meteorite.

305
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:41,460
I was working on a 64 Corvair at home.

306
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:48,980
I happened to see this red ball of fire going across, get come up and went towards the mountain,

307
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,500
just like if it was radio controlled.

308
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,300
It made a figure eight, and it came right down in here, and Bully landed right in here,

309
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,660
knocked the top of the trees out.

310
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,260
It stunk like rotten eggs.

311
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,260
You could smell it.

312
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,260
And then just like sizzling and like sparks coming, just like if it was cooling off, it

313
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,580
was red hot.

314
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,540
Bullybush is the only witness I'm aware of to describe the presence of a smell.

315
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,460
The description of a strong smell, in this case rotten eggs, a.k.a. a sulfuric smell,

316
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:24,740
reminds me closely of the strong ammonia smell witnesses described in the 1997 Virginia

317
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
Brazil case.

318
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,500
Bill Bullybush, who fled the woods when he heard the fireman approaching, independently

319
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,380
described a nearly identical object.

320
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,740
I could see it.

321
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,740
Pretty good.

322
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,700
There was no welding, no windows, no nothing on it, and none on the back was a ring, and

323
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,860
it had like Egyptian writing on it, and I couldn't figure out what it was.

324
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,340
From his statements, we can piece together, Bullybush left the scene upon the arrival

325
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,700
of the fire crew, who witnessed the object for a span of 15 minutes until the men described

326
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,500
by Romansky ordered the fireman to leave.

327
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,620
And we do have a witness who states he observed the craft and retrieval crew departing the

328
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,620
woods.

329
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,940
In the early 1990s, I witnessed Jerry Betters, a Pittsburgh jazz musician, came forward with

330
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,340
his testimony.

331
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,940
At 41 years old in 1965, Betters lived near the area of Kecksburg in a town called Murrisville.

332
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,620
Jerry noticed the now infamous fireball, which agitated the horses he was feeding and surrounding

333
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,060
dogs.

334
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,340
Upon hearing the news report of the object crashing in Kecksburg, Jerry phoned his friends

335
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,820
to pick him up and head to the town for a look.

336
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,820
Later with the area, the men found themselves on a private lane.

337
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,420
After rounding a slight turn, Jerry stated he was halted by a military roadblock.

338
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,180
The soldiers halting traffic appeared to wear army fatigues with cloth berets, but other

339
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,300
soldiers equipped with rifles and helmets stood at attention behind the roadblock.

340
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,060
Betters noticed a number of quote unquote military brass officers, well-dressed civilians,

341
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,140
and scattered army star emblazoned jeeps and personnel trucks.

342
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,860
Jerry's attention was commanded towards a large cab and flatbed trailer.

343
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,700
He noticed a domed or acorn-shaped object that was uncovered and being hauled away from

344
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
the woods.

345
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,780
Quickly, a tarp was placed over the object.

346
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,380
Betters noted the truck seemed to have trouble traversing up through the field.

347
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,140
Jerry Betters also described the truck and his encounter in a notarized document.

348
00:25:42,380 --> 00:26:10,780
We

349
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,580
do have other witnesses who claim to have been held at gunpoint by the attending military

350
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
forces.

351
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:45,060
The individual is local resident David Newhouse.

352
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:58,540
In fact, there are dozens of witness testimony from Kecksburg locals and nearby citizens

353
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,880
we could analyze all day.

354
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,600
Like that of then teenager Bill Weaver, who noticed four men exit a light-colored box

355
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,060
truck dressed in quote unquote moon suits and head towards the crash area, or then 14-year-old

356
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:16,220
Mike Slater, who stated an army officer told Mike and his friend they could do a great

357
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,420
service to their country by sending curious crash seekers wrong directions.

358
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,180
We even have witnesses who state they observed the craft after it was taken out of the field,

359
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:32,900
and we will address these shortly.

360
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:38,020
A bell-shaped craft big enough to fit a man with strange hieroglyphic writing was described

361
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,700
by many civilian witnesses the night of December 9th, 1965.

362
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,380
It is interesting how Blue Book contended the object was a meteor and that nothing was

363
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,740
found at the crash site after all of the witness testimony and trajectory and speed calculations

364
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,780
conducted while the object was in the air that are not consistent with meteor travel.

365
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:01,100
As mentioned earlier, Blue Book did receive some fragmented material that was seen to

366
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,180
fall off of the craft, sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

367
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,940
Blue Book declared this material as chaff, which is quote, material dropped by aircraft

368
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,300
to confuse radar complexes when participating in interdiction exercises, end quote.

369
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,820
The conclusion of a meteor with presence of this said chaff leads to further inconsistencies

370
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,740
in Blue Book's reporting.

371
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,700
Early skeptics of Kecksburg stated the craft may have been the remains of Soviet spacecraft

372
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,300
Cosmos 96.

373
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:33,020
This conclusion was not supported in a 1965 NASA press release, which stated Cosmos 96

374
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:38,180
had decayed and landed in Canada roughly 13 hours prior to the Kecksburg event.

375
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:43,260
This NASA briefing says, quote, other analyses of the spacecraft orbit definitively indicate

376
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,260
it could not have been the Cosmos 96 spacecraft, end quote.

377
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,660
Stan Gordon further concluded the Kecksburg event was not the result of Cosmos 96 when

378
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,700
he received documents through FOIA requests from both the U.S. Space Command and Naval

379
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,220
Surveillance Center, which verified Cosmos 96 entered the atmosphere at roughly 3.18

380
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:06,380
Eastern Standard Time over Canada on December 9, 1965.

381
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,940
Some such as NASA mission specialist James Oberg maintained the object was a capsule

382
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,620
of Soviet origin recovered in secrecy for its heat shielding.

383
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,700
Joining us now from Houston is spaceflight engineer and author James Oberg, who has studied

384
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,140
the reported sighting in Kecksburg and has his own theory about what landed there in

385
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,140
1965.

386
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:32,340
Mr. Oberg, first of all, do you believe that something crashed in Kecksburg in 1965 and

387
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,180
was it a UFO?

388
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,820
If it's anything, it might be something a lot more Earth-like.

389
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,020
It might be a spacecraft from Russia and not from Mars.

390
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:45,700
It turns out we do know that a Russian probe fell back to Earth that day, and it was a

391
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,860
special kind of probe.

392
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,020
It was one of their probes to the planet Venus.

393
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,740
It failed, was trapped in Earth orbit, and eventually fell out of orbit.

394
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,940
What might have been on that Russian space probe that the U.S. would have been so interested

395
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
in?

396
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,540
Oh, the most important thing about the probe would be the heat shield, how thick it was,

397
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,900
what material it was made out of, how heavy it was, and once we knew that, we could then

398
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,180
analyze how big their warheads would be in their ICBMs.

399
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,580
But in this clip, it is necessary to mention Oberg is still mentioning Cosmos 96.

400
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:20,100
Others have wondered if the craft was indeed a Gemini or Orion capsule expelled in the area,

401
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,020
such as Assistant Chief of Kecksburg Fire Department Jim Mays, who got within 75 yards

402
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,580
of the object but didn't get a clear view.

403
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,940
But the idea of a man-made space capsule crashing into the Midwest of the continental

404
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:37,820
United States was further discredited in this May 2000 Leslie Keen conference titled, Combating

405
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:43,420
Media Ridicule and Searching for Evidence on the 1965 Kecksburg Crash Case.

406
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:49,100
Some of you may know journalist Leslie Keen as the writer of the 2017 New York Times article

407
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,300
bringing the Pentagon UAP videos and OSAP slash ATIP to the public zeitgeist.

408
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:59,100
In this conference, Keen discussed her correspondence with Nicholas Johnson, NASA Chief Scientist

409
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,460
for Orbital Debris at the NASA Johnson Space Center.

410
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,980
Johnson analyzed the orbital data of the Soviet Venus probe Cosmos 96 and determined the object

411
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,820
could not have landed in Kecksburg near 5 p.m. December 9, 1965.

412
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,620
Furthermore, Johnson stated no man-made space object landed in Pennsylvania on the day of

413
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,620
the crash.

414
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,940
So I was able to contact an important scientist from NASA, probably the leading expert in

415
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,900
the world on this issue and he was named Nicholas Johnson, he's the Chief Scientist for Orbital

416
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,220
Debris at the NASA Johnson Space Center.

417
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:36,500
He was able to obtain the coordinates of Cosmos 96 so that he could calculate if part of it

418
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,620
had kept stayed in orbit after the crash that happened that morning, could it have landed

419
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:45,100
in Pennsylvania and he was able to determine absolutely not, made the statement for us

420
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,540
that it is impossible that that could have been Cosmos 96.

421
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,540
And the more interesting statement he made was that in fact there is no man-made object

422
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:59,380
that came down over Pennsylvania at 5 o'clock on that day, there's no man-made object and

423
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,260
he said that he has the databases and the knowledge to determine, even if it had been

424
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,140
some kind of secret experiment he would be aware of it.

425
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,980
He was also able to eliminate the project Corona which was a project that was dropping

426
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:18,260
these canisters, it was sending out these spy satellites to Russia, photographing things

427
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:23,140
from the sky flying back over the United States and dropping canisters which were then retrieved.

428
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,340
Some people have thought that that might have been what it was, he was also able to eliminate

429
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
that.

430
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Keen's work on retrieving official Kecksburg documents is truly fascinating.

431
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,740
In the early 2000s working with the Coalition of Freedom of Information, CFI, Keen took

432
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:43,460
legal action towards NASA for stonewalling files on Kecksburg and in 2007 she won.

433
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,140
A settlement in October of 2007 required NASA to provide hundreds of never-before-seen

434
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,660
documents to Keen and CFI while paying all legal fees.

435
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,740
NASA's search for documents on the craft was completed by August 2009, where NASA

436
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:02,820
posted 220 pages of Moondust documents with zero relation to Kecksburg.

437
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,140
According to a NASA Public Affairs document, quote, NASA sent its files to the National

438
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,940
Archives for Safekeeping two years after the Kecksburg incident.

439
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:16,500
In 1996, the National Archives told NASA that the files had been marked as lost since

440
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,020
1987, end quote.

441
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,500
We won't spend any time on Moondust, but if you have never heard of the program I

442
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,860
highly recommend watching my video on Moondust which covers this program in depth along with

443
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:32,380
its fellow programs UFO and Blue Fly, tasked with recovering descended foreign space vehicles

444
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,020
during the Cold War.

445
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:39,520
It is a very strange convenience that files relating to Kecksburg were lost forever.

446
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,500
But let's explore what witnesses like Romansky, Bullybush, Betters, and myriad other witnesses

447
00:33:44,500 --> 00:34:09,240
describe crashing into the woods that cold evening.

448
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,480
Many will remember when I covered this infographics crash retrieval operator video that contained

449
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,260
a fascinating first-hand testimony.

450
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:22,160
Very rarely do well-known UFO sightings describe a bell or acorn-shaped craft, certainly not

451
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,920
one that is bronze, 10 to 12 feet high with strange writing along the base.

452
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,160
But as it turns out, there are a wealth of similar sightings we can analyze.

453
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,800
Let's take a look at this December 2, 1952 Blue Book case into Quincy, Louisiana, where

454
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,320
multiple eyewitnesses observed an acorn-shaped object emitting pink, green, red, and yellow

455
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,960
lights moving up and down in altitude for a period of two and a half hours.

456
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,240
We can also analyze this November 10, 1956 Blue Book case in Massachusetts, where both

457
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,680
civilian and military sources observed an acorn shape featuring a white base, red side,

458
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,040
and green glow.

459
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,680
Blue Book labeled this case as probably the planet Venus.

460
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,160
On August 23, 1957, Blue Book reported a sighting of a bell-shaped object climb and

461
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,280
move out of eyesight of observers in New Jersey.

462
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,320
The case was explained away as a weather balloon from Philadelphia Municipal Airport.

463
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,600
Around the time of Kecksburg, November 1965 to be exact, residents in Manhattan, New York

464
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,760
reported to Blue Book of a bell-shaped UFO hovering above Manhattan during an electricity

465
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,140
blackout.

466
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,080
There are over half a dozen other Blue Book cases I can reference off the top of my head

467
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,720
like a 7-8 foot bell changing colors in 1965 seen over Bunky, Louisiana.

468
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,360
In the video description, you can find additional Blue Book cases featuring bell or acorn-shaped

469
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:48,200
UFOs from 1957, 1954, 1965, and 1957.

470
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,280
But I would like to draw your attention to a now-deleted Reddit entry titled, quote,

471
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,240
I worked on a team that dealt with NHI technology and left in 2018, end quote.

472
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,440
This alleged Reddit whistleblower is another in a long line of enigmatic, anonymous individuals

473
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,320
who make astonishing claims on Reddit, 4chan, or other message boards before deleting their

474
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,040
profiles, leaving users debating endlessly to the validity of their entries.

475
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,680
I will save exploring this testimony for a full video as I find this post fascinating,

476
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,240
but to summarize this post, the leaker became disgruntled and sought to vent about his career

477
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,080
within an agency that dealt with issues related to non-human intelligence.

478
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,600
One paragraph of this perplexing post caught my attention, quote,

479
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,360
Later I worked in a facility, within a facility, just like the one I had tried to inspect.

480
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,160
It stored a craft.

481
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,640
Being near the craft for extended periods of time is extremely dangerous, especially if

482
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,000
it is being experimented on with power.

483
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,320
I didn't observe any injuries to anyone while I was there, but all sorts of long-term nasty

484
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,960
injuries were relayed to me through rumors and warnings.

485
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,080
The craft was shaped like a dreidel without the handle.

486
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,840
There was a large exterior piece that went missing when it was recovered.

487
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:07,600
The theory is it acted as a stabilizer, although some argue it was a crude weapon, end quote.

488
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,560
Before we break this down, the anonymous poster also said, quote,

489
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,200
The shape was directly informed by its purpose.

490
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,080
Every shape is custom-molded in a metallic material that would revolutionize the way

491
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,620
we travel if we had it, end quote.

492
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,720
This method of molding sounds extremely similar to the statements of first-hand Kecksburg

493
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:35,880
witness and machinist Jim Romansky.

494
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,960
Discussion of peril to human bodies and cognition when in proximity to UAP is being heavily

495
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,840
explored in 2024, and has even been mentioned in a graphic in Lou Elizondo's book Eminent.

496
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,360
The craft description, a dreidel without its handle, sounds almost identical to the craft

497
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,240
Romansky, Bully Bush, Betters, and others described.

498
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:00,360
The Reddit user also states a large exterior piece went missing when the craft was recovered.

499
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:05,280
While remember back to our 1965 fireball, witnesses discussed pieces falling off of

500
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,600
the blazing fireball in the sky.

501
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,720
Blue Book even claimed to have retrieved pieces of chaff from the object.

502
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:17,200
Interesting, I am once again drawn to whistleblower Stephen Lovekin, who claimed a special classified

503
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,480
portion of Blue Book had actually recovered debris from the Roswell wreckage.

504
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,360
Lastly, the writing described as hieroglyphics reminds me of three other cases.

505
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,320
The writing on the Roswell debris described by primary witness Jesse Marcel Sr.

506
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,720
The writing along the lip of a craft craft, Danny Sheehan observed photos of, in the classified

507
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,240
files of Blue Book while under order from President Jimmy Carter.

508
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,640
And the writings that appeared to project off of what was considered recovered weapon technology

509
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:53,440
by witness RA at the Offworld Technologies Division.

510
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,560
I will discuss Dr. Eric A. Walker only briefly as I have already covered him in my majestic

511
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,280
documents project with Ryan Wood and in my Robert Sarbacher and the early days of the

512
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,400
UFO crash retrieval video.

513
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,920
Robert Sarbacher, physicist and member of the U.S. Joint Research and Development Board

514
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,480
named Dr. Eric A. Walker in an interview with Stanton Freedman, implicating Dr. Walker as

515
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,400
an integral member to UFO crash retrieval and UFO study alongside Dr. Vannevar Bush.

516
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:28,200
Dr. Eric A. Walker was the president of Penn State University from 1956 to 1971, a member

517
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,480
of many defense boards including chairman of the Institute for Defense Analysis and the

518
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,520
executive secretary of the Defense Research Board from 1950 to 1951.

519
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,560
Throughout the 1980s, Walker would be contacted by numerous UFO researchers, such as William

520
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,600
Steinman and Habib Henry Asadahel, a pseudonym for Armin Victorian.

521
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,160
Walker would confirm attendance at meetings centered on UFO crash and body retrieval efforts

522
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,920
in 1949 to 1950, discuss the validity of MJ-12, comment on the difficulty of breakthroughs

523
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,680
in UFO reverse engineering and make all sorts of cryptic statements on needing to understand

524
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,040
ESP to become involved with UFO programs.

525
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,960
Let's break down this conversation between Armin Victorian and Walker, where Kecksburg

526
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,160
is referenced, and before we do an interesting note, primary Kecksburg researcher Stan Gordon

527
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,360
did state there was a report of someone fitting Dr. Walker's description at the crash site.

528
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,240
In the interview, Walker states he went to the Kecksburg crash site with two men from

529
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,480
the military that were not on duty.

530
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,600
He also went with a fellow colleague of his.

531
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,360
When asked if it was a UFO recovered, Walker states, quote, I cannot comment on that.

532
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,120
I cannot tell you, end quote.

533
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,160
Walker would not comment on if he was at the crash site for long, but did state he and

534
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,400
the other men did not prepare any reports.

535
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,720
Two men from the military, but not on duty.

536
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,320
So we can rule out here that these were the three USAF Blue Book personnel from the 662nd

537
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,080
radar squadron dispatched to the crash site.

538
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,960
Could Walker and his mentioned off-duty military companions possibly be the men in civilian

539
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,840
clothes referenced by numerous eyewitnesses or possibly the men in trench coats who ordered

540
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,160
Romansky and the firemen away from the UFO?

541
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,960
And we must ask, why did Walker not prepare any reports?

542
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,120
Can we take Walker's refusal to comment on the presence of a UFO as an admission that

543
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,320
non-human technology did in fact crash in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania?

544
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,040
And last part here, Walker mentions a colleague of his accompanying him to the crash site.

545
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,400
In 1965, Walker was serving as president of Pennsylvania State University, a shadowy

546
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,840
witness I covered and spoke to as TB.

547
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,880
I highly recommend watching my UFO witness list redacted video to analyze his entire

548
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,880
story.

549
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,680
According to alleged emails with Dr. Stephen Greer, TB stated UFO program USAPs, unacknowledged

550
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,120
special access programs, are embedded within UARCs, university affiliated research centers

551
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,960
for the Department of Defense.

552
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,760
As it turns out, Pennsylvania State University does indeed have a UARC, the Applied Research

553
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,960
Laboratory for the US Navy.

554
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,280
In fact, Walker would help create the Applied Research Center at the behest of the US Navy

555
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,160
in 1945 following World War II, where Dr. Walker moved 100 engineers from Harvard to Penn

556
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,360
State.

557
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:20,720
Not only was this ARL awarded the largest research contract in Penn State history, $2.1 billion

558
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,720
from the Navy.

559
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,720
The ARL also currently specializes in prototyping novel power and energy systems, electrooptics

560
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,400
and directed energy.

561
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,200
Could Walker and his colleague have been tasked with investigating the Kexburg crash for UAP

562
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,880
programs stemming from Penn State University's Affiliated Research Center, the Applied Research

563
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,720
Laboratory?

564
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:52,520
In his 2024 book Eminent, Lou Elizondo named Lyndon B. Johnson amongst Truman, Eisenhower,

565
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,280
JFK, Carter, Reagan, H.W. Bush, and Trump, as presidents who were briefed into sum to

566
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,640
all of the UFO phenomenon.

567
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,200
This statement by Elizondo plus his relationship with Dr. Eric Walker, who self-admitted he

568
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,720
was present at the Kexburg crash, leads us to do some serious investigation into Lyndon

569
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:15,040
B. Johnson, who served in office from 1963 to 1969.

570
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:21,040
We can see in the luncheon in the White House, dated August 3, 1964, Eric A. Walker amongst

571
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,640
other colleague presidents met with Lyndon B. Johnson.

572
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,040
Walker was also the only university president to be invited by Johnson to attend the Clean

573
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,120
Air Act signing in the White House in 1967.

574
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,040
But we can also find a handful of letters between Walker and Johnson, such as this September

575
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,880
10, 1964 letter in which the president writes Walker thanking him profusely for his service

576
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,240
as a member of the Board of Visitors to the U.S. Military Academy.

577
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,800
Some unreferenced actions recommended by Walker were to be instated by the Secretary of Defense

578
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,520
at Johnson's request.

579
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,920
This report very well may have nothing to do with UAP, but Johnson and Walker were close

580
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,520
enough to exchange personal letters.

581
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,520
Let's also analyze the September 24, 1964 letter addressed to Dr. Walker from Johnson,

582
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,440
Dr. Walker to personally recommend a university student to honor as a young leader.

583
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,120
Or how about this May 18, 1966 letter dated after the Kecksburg incident in which Johnson

584
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:23,040
again profusely thanks Walker for his service as a member and chairman of the National Science

585
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,200
Board.

586
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,520
One Dr. Hornig is mentioned here, pay attention to that name for later.

587
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,960
In this letter, Lyndon B. Johnson cryptically says, quote, I should also like to thank you

588
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,680
for the unstinting manner in which you served your government in other areas, including

589
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,840
your recent tenure as a board of the Defense Science Board, end quote.

590
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,720
Just how deep was this relationship between the president and a man associated with USG

591
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
crash retrieval efforts?

592
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,020
Johnson also had a provable interest in UFOs during his time in the U.S. Senate before

593
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,280
his presidency.

594
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:59,320
In this article titled, Lyndon B. Johnson Calls for UFO Alert, we can see Johnson attempted

595
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:05,000
to institute a military subcommittee to report UFO sightings personally to him.

596
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,880
Johnson even wrote to Major Donald Kehoe, an excellent ufologist and author of the Flying

597
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:16,340
Saucer Conspiracy in 1960 thanking Kehoe for delivering documented evidence on UFOs.

598
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:21,520
With all of this interest in UFOs and his relationship with the shadowy Dr. Eric Walker,

599
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,280
what was Johnson doing during and after the December 9, 1965 Kecksburg event and how much

600
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,880
did he know?

601
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,080
In his 2024 release of all of his research files, Grant Cameron has supplied incredibly

602
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,960
crucial documents discussing Johnson's actions and meetings around the time of the Kecksburg

603
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,080
crash.

604
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:46,040
Here we find President Lyndon B. Johnson's schedule for December 9 through the 11, 1965.

605
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,440
Since the time of the Kecksburg event occurred around 4 to 5 p.m. Eastern Standard, we will

606
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,000
begin to analyze late appointments on the 9th and meetings the following day.

607
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,520
The evening of December 9, the President seemed to partake in many leisure activities,

608
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,000
dinner, driving around the Texas White House, watching the evening news, etc.

609
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,280
On the morning of December 10, 9.50 to be exact, solely an hour after waking, we see

610
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,800
a massive roster of guests arrive for an exhausting day of meetings.

611
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,940
The arrivals include the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or JCS as I'll refer to them, the Secretary

612
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:24,880
and Undersecretary of Defense, doctors such as the aforementioned Dr. Donald Hornig,

613
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,720
high-up USG officials, NASA Director James Webb, and more.

614
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,720
While no meetings this day make explicit mention of Kecksburg, Soviet spy satellites or ICBMs,

615
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,200
every single one of these names offer crucial insight and a key piece to the puzzle of the

616
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:46,360
Kecksburg mystery, and the possibility of a red-in President addressing a pressing UFO

617
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,840
crash retrieval.

618
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,100
Almost immediately upon the guests' arrival, the President began his meetings for over

619
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,460
two hours from 10.10 a.m. to 12.51 p.m.

620
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,580
Johnson met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bill Moyers, Joe Califano, Secretary McNamara,

621
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,820
and Secretary Vance.

622
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,100
There is a lot to break down here as each name warrants investigation.

623
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:12,900
The Joint Chiefs of Staff include US Navy Admiral Donald L. McDonald, who was in 1965

624
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:18,100
serving as the Chief of Naval Operations in General Wallace M. Green, commandant of the

625
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,940
US Marine Corps, not much to analyze about these gentlemen.

626
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:27,180
But during LBJ's presidency, USAF General J. P. McConnell served as Chief of Staff for

627
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,860
the US Air Force.

628
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:35,660
Upon taking his position on February 1, 1965, he relieved General Curtis LeMay.

629
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:39,980
If that name sounds familiar, we have discussed LeMay earlier in this video and at length

630
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:45,020
as the General who denied Senator Barry Goldwater to the Blue Room at Wright-Patterson Air Force

631
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:50,780
Base, and congratulated Harry B. Cooper for his work on the quote-unquote UFO program.

632
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,300
LeMay's ties to ufology are vast.

633
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:59,380
Also among the JCS was US Army General Earl Wheeler, who sat as the Chairman for the Joint

634
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:04,220
Chiefs of Staff, worth noting Wheeler shot to the top of the ranks of the US military

635
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:09,500
without much combat experience, eliciting criticism from many including none other than

636
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:14,420
General Curtis LeMay, who called Wheeler quote, Paulie Parrot, end quote.

637
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:18,820
A small detail worth noting after the meeting all of the Chiefs of Staff took a car ride

638
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,180
with Johnson, all but the under-qualified Wheeler.

639
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:27,000
The last Chief of Staff present in the early meetings is General Harold K. Johnson, Chief

640
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,980
of Staff for the US Army.

641
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,220
Johnson spearheaded the Eighth Calvary Regiment, which in Vietnam was a component of the First

642
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,700
Calvary Division.

643
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,820
The division I suspected in the Infographics whistleblower video to contain the soldiers

644
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,220
who witnessed the crashed UAP.

645
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:46,260
These Joint Chiefs of Staff were all overly qualified to be associated with the program

646
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:50,780
and briefed Johnson on the crashed UFO from the evening before, but this trail goes even

647
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,780
deeper.

648
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,900
As previously mentioned, including in the morning meetings were Bill Moyers, the personal

649
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:01,220
assistant to Lyndon B. Johnson, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Deputy Secretary

650
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:06,300
of Defense Cyrus Vance, and Naval Veteran Special Assistant of the Secretary and Deputy

651
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,380
Secretary of Defense Joe Califano.

652
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,580
Califano would attend many of the meetings with Johnson the day of the 10th, but here

653
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:18,500
let's make special notice to Califano's duty as a member of the Federal Radiation

654
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,500
Council.

655
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,460
Califano had a history of dealing with aerial collisions and crashes that required the Atomic

656
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:30,420
Energy Commission's involvement, such as this December 4th and 5th 1965 case of a midair

657
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,020
aircraft collision.

658
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:36,900
What is interesting to note here is a subsequent off-record meeting with Califano and Buford

659
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:42,940
Ellington, Director of the Office of Emergency Planning on December 13th, 1965, four days

660
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,300
after Kecksburg.

661
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,620
Why was this off-record meeting sent to Grant Cameron from the Lyndon B. Johnson Library

662
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,740
and Museum considered off-record?

663
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:56,660
Following the JCS car ride excluding Wheeler, the guests engaged in lunch before Johnson

664
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:02,620
met with McNamara, Vance, Bill Moyers, and Dr. Donald Hornig, as well as Secretary Orville

665
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,860
Freeman.

666
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:08,620
Donald Hornig served as Presidential Science Advisor to Johnson after also serving the

667
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,700
late John F. Kennedy Jr.

668
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:15,940
The Presidential Science Advisor was a position first held by Dr. Vannevar Bush to Franklin

669
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,220
D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman.

670
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,580
This should ring a bell to anybody familiar with the majestic documents.

671
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:26,740
The last member of this post-lunch meeting included Secretary Orville Freeman, U.S. Secretary

672
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:31,480
of Agriculture under Johnson from 1961 to 1969.

673
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,020
Why would a former Marine and Secretary of Agriculture be present at a meeting with three

674
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,720
Secretaries of Defense and the Science Advisor to the President?

675
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,600
What is even weirder here is the presence of James Webb alongside an Undersecretary

676
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,600
of Agriculture.

677
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:51,800
I take you to July 9th, 1947, just two days after the Roswell crash, where James Webb,

678
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,200
sitting as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, made late evening calls to Norris

679
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,260
E. Dodd, Undersecretary of Agriculture.

680
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:03,860
This may very well be a stretch here, but we must pursue all research angles, was Webb

681
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:08,180
discussing the Roswell event with Dodd and do positions like Secretary of Agriculture

682
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,940
entwine more with UAP programs than we might think.

683
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:16,220
I won't spend too much more time on the meetings as we have already discussed the significance

684
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,620
of most of the members in their grouping, and I have glossed over some of the other

685
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,540
interesting players like Dr. Glenn Seaborg, who was a Nobel Prize winning chemist and

686
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,620
atomic energy chairman, from 1961 to 1971.

687
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:33,620
I could make an entire video on the significance of this day of meetings, but the JCS and every

688
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,540
single individual summoned to Johnson's Texas residence the day after Kecksburg holds

689
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:48,980
massive importance and possibly signifies a day of briefings and meetings on the crash.

690
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:53,380
To further our investigation of Kecksburg, we can analyze multiple witnesses claiming

691
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,780
to have observed the Kecksburg bell after it was dragged from the woods that cold winter

692
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,780
night.

693
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:04,460
One such witness contacted Stan Gordon before the airing of a 1990 Unsolved Mysteries broadcast

694
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:10,020
on Kecksburg and provided detailed information on his experience with the Kecksburg craft.

695
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,260
According to this witness, as a member of the Air Force security team at Lockborn Air

696
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:19,140
Force Base near Columbus, Ohio, he guarded the object on the early morning of December

697
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:25,060
10, 1965, after the object had been transported from Pennsylvania.

698
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:29,140
According to this witness, after arriving on a truck, the craft was backed into a hangar

699
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:32,380
and security was greatly tightened around the base.

700
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:37,100
The object whose description matched the 10-12 foot bronze bell apparently stayed at the

701
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:42,020
base only a short time the morning of the 10th, before being transported to Wright-Patterson

702
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,300
Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio.

703
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:48,340
And we do have witnesses who claim to have observed the bell at Wright-Patt.

704
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:53,780
This witness, Myron, first contacted Stan Gordon after the airing of the 1990 Unsolved Mysteries

705
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:59,100
broadcast and was interviewed and investigated by the legendary Leonard Stringfield.

706
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,620
The trucker claimed the only reason he would discuss his experience was due to thinking,

707
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:08,660
quote, it would be okay to discuss what he saw since it was now on TV, end quote.

708
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:12,060
The word of Stringfield carries much weight for myself and others.

709
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:16,420
And regarding Myron, Stringfield stated in UFO crash retrievals, the Inner Sanctum status

710
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:21,860
reports six, quote, after a number of lengthy interviews and getting his testimony on videotapes

711
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:27,740
at his home by a medical friend and research associate, Dr. Brian Thompson, I feel convinced

712
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,660
of Myron's sincerity, end quote.

713
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,900
Stringfield's analysis of Kecksburg would remain extremely balanced.

714
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:38,740
We can take for example Stringfield's discussion of an insider known as Uncle, who spoke to

715
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:45,500
Stringfield through an intermediary, as noted in 1993 status report three, amassing the evidence.

716
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:50,860
Uncle told Stringfield he was on the right track with his research but cautioned of disinformation.

717
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:56,300
Among Uncle statements were claims of understanding alien biological structures, that UFOs were

718
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:02,220
of benign origin, and that the Kecksburg case involved a crashed spy plane, while the heavily

719
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:07,260
contested Fort Riley and Johannesburg, South Africa crash cases were true.

720
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,260
All this is to say that Stringfield did in fact note opinions against Kecksburg but

721
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,220
still pursued the case for well over a decade.

722
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:18,780
Anyways, back to Myron, as noted for the record by Stringfield, Myron stated he and

723
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:24,380
his cousin, J.S., worked for a family owned shale and tile brick business in Ohio.

724
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:28,380
Two or three days following the Kecksburg crash, the company was contracted for a large

725
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:32,420
order of special glazed bricks to Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

726
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,900
The customer, the U.S. Navy, according to Myron, sent a representative to the business

727
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,460
to select and inspect the bricks.

728
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,900
Myron claimed receipts of this transaction were lost when the business was sold to new

729
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,900
owners.

730
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,180
The specialty brick in question was a, quote, double glazed engineered brick, end quote.

731
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:53,260
Myron would later state the purpose of these bricks were to build a double thick, lead

732
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:58,580
lined protective structure around the Kecksburg UFO to protect against radiation.

733
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:02,740
The shipment of bricks was delivered at a designated gate where Myron and J.S. arrived

734
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,660
in different flatbed trucks.

735
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:09,360
Once outside Wright Pat, a two or three star general dressed in a blue uniform led the

736
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,780
delivery men to a warehouse ahead.

737
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:16,740
The destination for the bricks was a brick warehouse, 50 to 80 feet inside, accessible

738
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:22,180
by a narrow blacktop driveway surrounded by rows of offices and a power plant.

739
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:27,740
To quote Myron, nearby the building was a, quote, Army 35 foot long tri-axle lowboy

740
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,100
that I later learned transported the object.

741
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,820
A tarp was still draped over its midsection, end quote.

742
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:38,380
Myron noticed four or five frantic personnel outside the building, equipped with white

743
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:44,020
coveralls, visored headgear, rubber gloves and boots, and a Colt 45 pistol, quote, who

744
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:47,580
were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, end quote.

745
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:51,380
From Myron's point of view, the people inside the warehouse were solely concerned about the

746
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,260
object inside the building.

747
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:57,380
The personnel and delivery men unloaded the bricks by hand from trucks to pallets where

748
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:02,900
Myron noticed the men were navy, not air force by insignia on their uniforms.

749
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:07,020
During a break from unloading the shipment, Myron somehow managed to approach the warehouse's

750
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,700
door undetected and peer inside.

751
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:14,700
He observed metal scaffolding around a large, strange object with men at work.

752
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:19,300
Puzzling to Myron, parachute silks were suspended from the ceiling, partially enshrouding the

753
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:23,060
object, lit by one floodlight directed downward.

754
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:28,740
The object was bell shaped, measuring an estimated 10 feet tall and less than 10 feet wide, appearing

755
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:35,300
metallic with a dull copper or bronze color, but was charred or covered in a sooty residue.

756
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,500
During pursuing this mystery any further, irresistible, Myron asked one of the personnel

757
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,340
about his use of an acetylene torch.

758
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:46,460
Myron told Stringfield, quote, probably thinking that my presence there meant I had a proper

759
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,460
clearance.

760
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,900
The man who was wearing a visor told me he was trying to get inside, end quote.

761
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:56,460
Myron further explained to Stringfield the man told him all attempts to gain entry failed,

762
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,620
whether torch, diamond-headed drill bits, or acid.

763
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:04,620
This reminds me closely of the testimony of RB I covered in UFO whistleblowers, too,

764
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:10,140
who stated he guarded a hamburger-shaped saucer in 1963 for two weeks, where a science

765
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,980
team tried and failed with endless methods to gain entry to the craft.

766
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,340
Myron then went on to explain, quote, I was surprised when he told me that if there were

767
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:23,300
bodies inside, they might be too hot for the mortician to handle, end quote.

768
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,020
Bodies are always a contentious and interesting aspect of UAP retrieval.

769
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,540
We will address this point shortly.

770
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:33,740
Myron was then startled by the voice of a guard who said, forget what you've seen or

771
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:37,140
will lock you up and throw away the keys.

772
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:43,820
And we found the base, and they took us from the backside of the Wright-Patterson Air Base

773
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:50,620
all the way through the main part of the base, out the other side, down Maple Street, to

774
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:56,540
the old training center for World War II.

775
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,540
When I walked in and proceeded, I seen the bell shape.

776
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:07,020
It was sitting there on stelt, and it had a very big parachute or something draped down

777
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:12,020
over the top with a light up underneath the parachute, trying to cover this thing up so

778
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,700
no one could see it.

779
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,540
And you could see a ladder leaning against the bell before they were trying to get into

780
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,540
one of the openings.

781
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,740
And the guard said that he wasn't allowed to be in here, but how, I've already seen

782
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,580
everything in there.

783
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:31,540
So it didn't bother me when he ran me back out.

784
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:38,620
The spaceship looked like a large acorn, runs about 14 feet to the top and about 10

785
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:46,420
to 12 feet wide at the bottom with a collar on it that has writing on the collar.

786
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:51,940
And it had a triangle on it, and it looked like the triangle was put on there with a

787
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:58,940
welder by sticking the welder against the metal to shape the writing, and the writing

788
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:02,140
was all the way around the bell shape of it.

789
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:08,900
And the black, the bottom of the bell shape was completely black.

790
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:15,300
And around the top of the edges was smoke covered, and the space thing looked like it

791
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,620
was copper or bronze.

792
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,020
Stringfield contacted Myron's cousin on October 3, 1990.

793
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:25,980
J.S., as he'll be referred to, was reluctant to get involved due to family reasons.

794
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:30,860
He did confirm delivering glazed bricks to right pat with Myron, remembered guards wearing

795
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,300
protective clothing and a technician with a blow torch.

796
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:38,660
When Stringfield asked J.S. if he had seen the craft in the building, J.S. stated, quote,

797
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,260
I don't remember many details on that trip.

798
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:45,100
My partner probably knows more because he was more inquisitive.

799
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:51,020
Fast forward to 1991, Myron told Stringfield J.S. was willing to finally discuss his observations

800
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,540
that fateful December day in 1965.

801
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:59,820
On March 30 to April 1, 1991, Stringfield again interviewed J.S.

802
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,680
J.S. told Stringfield a new story.

803
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,860
He did in fact see the object the day before.

804
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,740
He and Myron went to right pat.

805
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,380
He had made the trip solo with an initial delivery of bricks and clearly recalled an

806
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:18,220
object shaped like the Liberty Bell sitting upright under a tarp aboard a low-boy trailer.

807
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:23,700
J.S. estimated the craft to be 8 to 10 feet tall and 8 to 10 feet wide, quote, I didn't

808
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,820
ask any questions, but it probably arrived a short time before I did, end quote.

809
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,460
J.S. discussed activity in the area.

810
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:35,900
Men wearing fatigued suits and there were armed guards, but he didn't see anyone carrying

811
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,380
any sort of rifle or machine gun.

812
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:42,980
Unlike the next day's trip, quote, there was nothing unusual at the entrance gate.

813
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:47,580
I gave the guard my identification and showed him my bill of landing and was directed to

814
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:56,140
the area for unloading near the big red brick building, end quote.

815
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:01,460
Like most cases, the discussion of bodies is the most controversial aspect of Kecksburg.

816
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:06,180
In his appearance in the 2003 annual crash retrieval conference proceedings, Stan Gordon

817
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:09,460
discussed the subject of bodies present at the crash.

818
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:14,500
To quote Stan, in more recent years I have heard rumors that are not widely known that

819
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:19,740
two small bodies were supposedly found at the impact location in 1965.

820
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:24,100
I have generally accepted this as hearsay since there has never been any evidence to

821
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,980
back up these claims.

822
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:30,540
One such testimony actually came from Myron, the trucker we just discussed, who spoke to

823
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,980
Gordon offering new details in 1998.

824
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:37,940
In poor health, Myron agreed to meet with Gordon for a documentary Gordon was working

825
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,820
on titled Kecksburg, the Untold Story.

826
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:46,220
Stan says the two were discussing what Myron saw in 1965, Myron suddenly mentioned something

827
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:51,620
which caused Stan and the video production crew to look at the man with astonishment.

828
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:55,700
Myron added to his previous testimony delivered to Gordon and Stringfield, stating when he

829
01:01:55,700 --> 01:02:00,100
peeked inside the warehouse he observed the bell propped up by scaffolding, but he also

830
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:04,060
saw a body lying on a workbench in the same room.

831
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:09,180
Myron added this body was covered in a white sheet, measuring four to five feet tall.

832
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:13,620
The only feature seen was lizard-like skin from a left hand sticking out from under

833
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:14,620
the cover.

834
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:18,540
I walked in the building and seen the bell shape there and they was working on it.

835
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:23,260
I also seen an object laying on the workbench over there and the workbench runs about ten

836
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:29,660
to twelve feet long and about thirty-two inches wide and about three foot, about thirty-six

837
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,300
inches off the floor.

838
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:37,060
I seen the left hand of every what was in there sticking out underneath of the sterile

839
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:44,380
white pad and he only had three fingers, it was about four foot nine or four foot five

840
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:52,580
inches tall if it was standing up, but it looked like it weighed about eighty pounds

841
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:59,020
and it had dark green or brownish skin and it was just like a lizard.

842
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:05,340
I have no doubt in my mind that the body laid on that table and the left hand of him was

843
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:12,540
sticking out underneath of the white sterile pad that they had placed over him and he had

844
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:18,340
the three index finger and his skin looked like lizard.

845
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:25,820
I asked Myron why he waited so many years to divulge what he had seen in 1965.

846
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:31,300
Well for the reason I never said anything before because Uncle Sam said if it were to

847
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:35,860
ever leased out and they had to come and lock you up and throw the keys away or give you

848
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:39,780
a bullet to satisfy you, no one will ever talk about it.

849
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:45,980
Right now is the time to tell it before something drastic happens and my son, he is twenty-four

850
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:51,980
years old and he said why are you going to do it now and I said well I may not live till

851
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:56,380
tomorrow the next day to tell it so I'll tell it all tonight and be done with it.

852
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:03,300
The only thing I've got now is a bad heart and high blood pressure and sugar and on oxygen

853
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:09,860
once in a while and walking around taking nitroglycerin and all there is now I'm telling

854
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:12,820
you now because I may not be here tomorrow.

855
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:18,420
Why add this onto his story after nearly a decade after his initial testimony?

856
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:23,020
Another witness Joel contacted Stan after hearing local news covering Leslie Keane and

857
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:26,780
the CFI's attempts to pry free Kecksburg documentation.

858
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:31,820
Gordon would meet with Joel at his home in late 2002, seeing Joel go back and forth on

859
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:35,640
whether or not to proceed with the interview in fear of getting in trouble for what he

860
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,640
saw.

861
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,580
Joel claimed on the day of the Kecksburg crash he entered the woods to investigate the crash

862
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,580
film.

863
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:46,980
His attention was drawn to a metal object emanating bright clashes of colors like electricity.

864
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:51,700
Joel hid in the woods to observe army and air force personnel, men in civilian clothing

865
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,900
and men in suits and hats enter the crash area.

866
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:59,260
Joel claimed to have observed an army general hop on top of the metallic object with a probe

867
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:02,140
in his hand similar to an officer's billy club.

868
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:05,740
The general smacked the object and the tool flew out of his hands.

869
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:10,940
Gordon noted at this time Joel's expression changed to a far more somber and uncomfortable

870
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:11,940
tone.

871
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:15,980
Joel stated soon after striking the object a hatch opened that swung from right to left

872
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:20,340
at the front of the object, accompanied by a whirling hissing sound.

873
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:25,460
Joel described a scene what looked like quote two fingers in an unusually long arm and quote

874
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:28,340
inside the hatch before it closed again.

875
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:32,500
The concept of bodies may be supported by the testimony of Bill Weaver I mentioned earlier

876
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,500
in the video.

877
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:38,460
Weaver, a teenager, observed men exit a large light colored box truck in what he described

878
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,940
as moonsuits.

879
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:45,140
The men carried a box shaped device measuring four to five feet square resting upon a stretcher

880
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,460
with four handles.

881
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:52,340
A little while later there was a large truck pulled in, a light colored truck, a box van

882
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,340
type.

883
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,460
Out of it there was four guys come out.

884
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,820
They had what we call moonsuits at the time.

885
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,820
They were white cover all type suits.

886
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:08,380
They took a box out of there, a box maybe four or five foot square.

887
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:14,100
They carried down four handles and they carried that down to the object.

888
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:17,660
About just right after that there was a military man.

889
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:23,300
He came over to the car and he told us to leave and I got into an argument with him.

890
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:27,460
I told him I didn't, you know, I wanted to stay, I didn't want to leave.

891
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:32,060
He told me that he would confiscate my car if I didn't.

892
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:33,060
What's going on everybody?

893
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,060
It's UAP Gerb.

894
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:40,580
Thank you so much for joining me today as we took a deep dive into the 1965 Kexburg, Pennsylvania

895
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,060
UFO crash.

896
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:46,540
Now, what would you say if I told you today we just started to scratch the surface of

897
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,540
this case?

898
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:52,340
Like I mentioned earlier in the witnesses tab, there are so many witnesses who have more

899
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,260
to add to this story.

900
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:59,900
The reason I covered Bulabush, Romansky, Betters, Weaver and so forth is because I think their

901
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:04,940
testimonies offer the most complete picture and insight into the Kexburg story.

902
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:09,860
There are other residents who talk about a military base being set up in a home near

903
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,980
them, kind of like Romansky discussed in his interview on Montel Williams.

904
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:17,620
There's other witnesses who talk more about the military presence and how it might have

905
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:21,580
been obfuscated from a certain point of view when the military had reached up on Meteor

906
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,260
Road and so forth.

907
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:26,700
So there is just so much rich testimony to pursue.

908
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:32,140
The Kexburg case has also seen so much coverage as we saw with Kexburg, the new Roswell, and

909
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:37,620
Kexburg the Untold Story and Kexburg the Unsolved Mysteries episode in Stan Gordon's

910
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,380
1993 documentary.

911
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,020
There has been so much coverage on this case.

912
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:48,580
That is why I tried to take a more focused approach on breaking down the crash, focusing

913
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:53,460
on a select few witnesses, focusing on the overall story, and kind of narrowing in on

914
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:59,020
what happened to the craft, the bell, after the case, as well as focusing on Eric Walker

915
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,140
and Lyndon B. Johnson.

916
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:05,140
Now those of you familiar with the case will know there are a couple things I didn't discuss

917
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,140
here.

918
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:11,180
One of these was D. Glock, the alleged Nazi wonder weapon that was shaped the exact same

919
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:16,060
shape as the Kexburg bell, a similar shape to the Liberty bell, and that is because I

920
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:20,820
would like to cover that and cover sort of Nick Cook's work in the hunt for zero point

921
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:24,140
and the Nazi connection to UAP in a whole nother video.

922
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:30,100
I also left out claims of Kexburg and affirmation of Kexburg from the witness Clifford Stone

923
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:34,380
who testified in the 2001 NPC conference under Stephen Greer.

924
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:38,340
I did this because of course Clifford Stone carries with him a little bit of controversy

925
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:44,740
so I want to analyze his claims and his merits before I put them into a Kexburg case in their

926
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,140
own video.

927
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:49,580
Now what were your favorite parts of this investigation?

928
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:54,380
For me, I must say I just I adore Jim Romansky.

929
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,500
I think he's an incredible witness, probably my favorite eyewitness of any case, the way

930
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,860
in which he passionately talks about the case and any interview he has, especially Montell

931
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:03,860
Williams.

932
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:09,020
I really appreciate his demeanor, I think he offers valuable insights into this case and

933
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:13,700
especially the Montell Williams show where he discusses kind of how his children faced

934
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:17,740
issues with his experience at Kexburg.

935
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:22,300
Also I hope everybody enjoyed kind of the oblique look into the blue berets.

936
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,260
I think that's one of the most crucial aspects of this investigation.

937
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:29,100
They need to be investigated much more and I will continue to do so over the course of

938
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,700
my videos.

939
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:34,900
Investigate there the incident Fort McGuire Dix as Leonard Stringfield supposed blue

940
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,140
beret insider has claimed.

941
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:42,180
Try to kind of focus in on the security police and Air Force police aspect of the blue berets

942
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:47,580
and see if these guys might be used as a rapid reaction unit for kind of domestic or even

943
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,980
foreign crash retrieval efforts.

944
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:53,260
Also of course I've talked about it in many videos and he's a person I view a sort of

945
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:58,060
a linchpin to the whole UAP phenomena, Dr. Eric A Walker.

946
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:02,740
Of course in this video we saw, we talked about this in the Sarbakar video but we ran

947
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:08,860
over his claims about saying he was in fact the Kexburg case and that he did know about

948
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:15,940
Majestic 12 and Robert Sarbakar was correct in terms of Dr. Eric A Walker being a crucial

949
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:18,380
member in UFO crash retrieval.

950
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:23,300
But what was new to me here was the UARC the university affiliated research center in the

951
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,860
ARL at Penn State University.

952
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:29,420
I think there's some great connections there to explore and I will continue to do so as

953
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:30,420
well.

954
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:35,340
Also I found the Lyndon B Johnson connections with Dr. Eric Walker as well as Johnson's

955
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:38,420
meeting scheduled the day after Kexburg fascinating.

956
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:43,220
Now if you look in the show notes and you can also find these PDFs posted in my discord

957
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:46,900
if you don't want to go to the link of Grant Cameron's files but you will see all of the

958
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,260
files I reference because I really recommend following along.

959
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:55,140
I just gave a brief sample of some of the content we went over in this video but there's

960
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:58,860
pages and pages and pages of Grant Cameron covering this case.

961
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:03,500
I also really recommend reading crash retrievals one through seven string fields work and seeing

962
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:07,020
how he approached the Kexburg case over a span of ten years.

963
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:12,740
It's really fascinating to see him kind of reference uncle the alleged insider he talked

964
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:18,540
to a through a media intermediary with and just him a interview Pete who is now of course

965
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:23,980
James Jim Romansky interview Myron and so forth speaking of Myron I find this witness

966
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,580
so interesting.

967
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:31,700
Initially I found it to be quite a red flag that Myron initially approached Stan Gordon

968
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:39,940
in the late 80s and also spoke to Leonard Stringfield and it wasn't until 1992 1993

969
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:44,340
for Stan Gordon's newest documentary that Myron touched on the topic of bodies when

970
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:49,820
he had only commented on what a personnel at the base had said to him before about it

971
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:52,780
being a hot issue for autopsies.

972
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:56,940
I think this case is a little different than something like the 1955 Del Rio case with

973
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:02,540
Robert Willingham as Robert Willingham initially stated he saw no such bodies and then changed

974
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:07,740
his tone in about the Jeff Rents episode maybe in 2008 2012 I want to say around the time

975
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:12,660
of the the book by Noah Torres came out.

976
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:16,740
Watching Myron was very interesting because that was a late pop up in my research seen

977
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:20,860
his interview in the 1993 Stan Gordon documentary.

978
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:26,300
He of course as he claimed felt much fear and that's why he kind of omitted the topic

979
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:33,060
of bodies before now there are a couple other witnesses who claim or are adjacent to body

980
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:37,860
claims here such as Don Sebastian I didn't cover him just because I didn't see how his

981
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:43,740
story really really gelled with other witnesses because he described when he approached the

982
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:48,220
scene and saw military men and was kind of hiding around observing the military operations

983
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:54,460
he heard a loud scream from the forest no other individual in the present area has also admitted

984
01:12:54,460 --> 01:13:00,100
hearing this scream so I left that out what did you guys think of the Kecksburg case I

985
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:03,980
want to know everybody's thoughts this of course is such a famous case of course I

986
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:08,420
think it's pretty self-evident this crash case has something very tangible something

987
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:12,620
that actually crashed in the woods in Kecksburg and this was not a meteor as Blue Book claimed

988
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:17,980
I think the the discussion of the chaff discovered alongside the meteor where the Blue Book team

989
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:24,060
from the 660 second radar squadron is extremely interesting I also am unsure about the claims

990
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:29,660
of Soviet capsule or American capsule I think there's plenty of evidence and discussion to

991
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:37,020
dispute the landing of a human-made space object I was really excited to relay this bell shape to

992
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:43,340
the infographics whistleblower and that reddit whistleblower post all too often in crash cases

993
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:48,780
we mainly hear about saucers or egg shapes so it's really cool to focus some attention on this

994
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:56,300
kind of almost a liberty bell shaped craft with strange hieroglyphs hieroglyphic writings on it

995
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:02,220
I think it's it's such a unique type of craft especially as described by many of the witnesses

996
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:08,060
just big enough to fit an individual maybe two the off-white the off-yellow bronze-ish color

997
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:14,140
and the fact this alongside other craft descriptions seems like it was made out of a single piece of

998
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:20,220
metal like pouring liquid metal into a cast I love this case right now I lean towards this

999
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:25,340
being a legitimate UAP retrieval case I think there's a lot of evidence here a lot more evidence

1000
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:30,220
that needs to be pursued of course the only thing missing from this case with all of the

1001
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:36,700
witness testimony with Johnson with Walker with with with all the witnesses after the fact is some

1002
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,420
official documents and those of course are very scant in this case because apparently NASA lost

1003
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:47,500
them in 1987 but again let me know what you guys think I want to appreciate every single person

1004
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,740
here watching this video thank you so much for giving me your time I can't believe you guys will

1005
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:57,660
sit through about an hour and a half I think at this time video please remember to leave a like

1006
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:02,780
and subscription means the most leave some comments let me know what you think remember guys I have a

1007
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:07,740
patreon I don't charge for any extra content I don't gate keep content on there only support

1008
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:12,620
what you think the channel is worth we got big things coming for the channel of course regular

1009
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:17,020
viewers will know that we're doing about one live a week I want to start doing some more interviews

1010
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:23,340
on the channel too I know right now that interviews I've had usually take three weeks or so to conjure

1011
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:28,140
up because there's so much editing involved I do want to do some pure interviews as well but of

1012
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:32,940
course I'll be in the lab working on my my interview skills because I can get very tripped up with my

1013
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:37,340
words as you all know but thank you so much for watching guys I will catch everybody on the next

1014
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:41,900
show thank you
