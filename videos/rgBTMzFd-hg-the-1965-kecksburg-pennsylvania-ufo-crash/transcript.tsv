0	2900	It didn't start or end with Roswell.
2900	8140	The 20th century of the United States saw several now infamous alleged UFO crash cases
8140	13180	that feature rich paper trails, a wealth of witnesses, and endless mystery.
13180	18260	Today we travel to the Midwest of the continental United States to a sleepy town in Pennsylvania
18260	19740	named Kecksburg.
19740	25620	We're on the evening of December 9th, 1965, something from the sky crashed into the nearby
25620	31840	woods, sending the town and the U.S. military into a frenzy, leading to one of the most
31840	36740	discussed and debated UFO crash retrieval cases of all time.
36740	38420	Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb.
38420	44880	Today we finally visit one of my most requested crash retrieval cases, the 1965 Kecksburg
44880	47100	Pennsylvania UFO crash.
47100	51380	Kecksburg has long been a favorite case in life due to the exhausting lists of local
51380	56660	witnesses, extensive press coverage, and fascinating ties to Blue Book and Project
56660	57660	Moondust.
57660	62220	What, if anything, crashed into the woods that cold winter evening.
62220	67540	Was it a meteor as Blue Book claimed, a Soviet satellite like many debunkers have claimed,
67540	73540	or indeed a craft of non-human intelligence as described by numerous eyewitnesses?
73540	78180	In a quick note here guys, excellent research has been conducted by respected ufologists
78180	79380	on this case.
79380	83260	I will primarily be referencing the work of the most seasoned Kecksburg investigator
83260	88380	Stan Gordon and the legend with whom Gordon shared much of his research and witnesses,
88380	94420	Leonard Stringfield.
94420	100580	In the early evening of December 9th, 1965, thousands of residents across Michigan, Indiana,
100580	106220	Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, and Canada observed a fiery brilliant glow
106220	111580	streak across the sky, a ball of fire leaving a smoke trail, estimated to be visible for
111580	114940	20 minutes after the passing of the object.
114940	118980	Numerous ground-based civilians and pilots initially thought the object to be an aircraft
118980	123620	in peril, especially due to pieces of the object seemingly detaching and falling over
123620	126460	Lapeer, Michigan, and Alleria, Ohio.
126460	130780	The material would later be recognized and studied within the official Blue Book report
130780	132060	on Kecksburg.
132060	137380	As noted by Clark McClelland, UFO researcher and former NASA Apollo space program member,
137380	142860	as well as Dr. Paul Anir, professor of astronomy, the object would make a change of course roughly
142860	146900	25 degrees when traveling over Alleria, Ohio.
146900	151380	Similar calculations showed the object to be between 40 and 60 miles in altitude when
151380	153340	first observed over Michigan.
153340	157860	McClelland estimated the speed of the glowing object based on the distance of witness observations
157860	163260	to be traveling at roughly 17 miles per minute or 1,062 miles per hour.
163260	170500	For reference, meteors traveled between 25 and 144,000 miles an hour, so even if McClelland's
170500	175940	calculations were off by a factor of 10, the object was still traveling at much slower
175940	179140	speeds than a meteor in Earth's atmosphere.
179140	184740	Around 4.45 pm, the object plunged into the woods of Kecksburg, Pennsylvania.
184740	189820	The object made a turn between Greensburg and La Trobe and was reported from local communities
189820	191760	as it moved towards the south.
191760	195980	Near Laurelville, the object turned again and began to track northeast towards the Kecksburg
195980	199300	area where it reportedly impacted into the woods.
199300	203340	Closely tracking the object, Project Blue Book dispatched a three-man Air Force team
203340	209940	from the 662nd Radar Squadron at the Oakdale Army installation near Pittsburgh to investigate.
209940	214500	The squadron was operating under control of the Aerospace Defense Command.
214500	219060	These orders were presumably given by Major Hector Quintanilla, who took the reins of Blue
219060	221060	Book in 1963.
221060	225520	The 33-page report on Kecksburg from Blue Book has Quintanilla's name all over the
225520	230940	memorandum for record, and it is important to note of Blue Book's conclusion of Kecksburg.
230940	234460	Under the major, the case was designated as a meteor.
234460	239340	And quickly worth mentioning, Blue Book states the three-man team found no materials at the
239340	240340	crash site.
240500	244300	Blue Book curiously marks this case under ACME, Pennsylvania.
244300	245780	Why is this?
245780	249520	Researchers are not sure, but one possibility is the Air Force personnel interviewed witnesses
249520	252340	who lived nearby in the town of ACME.
252340	257420	And speaking of Quintanilla, let's pay special attention to April 5, 1966, where the United
257420	262020	States Air Force Major lied before the House Armed Services Committee, stating that Blue
262020	265460	Book had no radar cases that were unexplained.
265460	269580	Scientific advisor to Blue Book, J. Allen Heineck, revealed this deception by providing
269580	277340	three such cases, 1951 Goose Bay, 1956 Lakinheath, and 1957 Shrevaport.
277340	281460	Although town residents argue to this day over what crashed in the woods that night,
281460	287180	the town witnesses agree within an hour of the impact military forces swarmed the area
287180	292580	almost as quickly as the arrival of Penn State Police and the Kecksburg Volunteer Fireman.
292580	295900	Twenty-eight years, I'm a fireman here at Kecksburg.
295900	302820	It does me good as a young, old fireman now that now we know that something did happen.
302820	305340	The military was here.
305340	309060	Everybody here is correct in what they've seen and what they heard.
309060	314820	I think because of the lay of the land and the terrain, there was different points of
314820	320500	vision from wherever they were at that point.
320500	324660	The outcome of our town meeting, a majority consensus that something big did happen in
324660	330580	Kecksburg on December 9th, 1965, and that despite the official report to the contrary,
330580	332060	soldiers were on site.
332060	336420	Regardless of USAF and Blue Book denying a presence of more than three men at Kecksburg,
336420	341060	a statement that will later be contradicted by Dr. Eric A. Walker, Kecksburg residents
341060	347460	gave descriptions of multiple types of military men, US Army soldiers equipped with M1 rifles,
347460	352820	USAF personnel with blue fatigues and blue berets, and men in civilian clothing seemingly
352820	358140	barking out orders and some witnesses even described men in hazmat suits labelling them
358140	360020	as moon suits.
360020	364380	There are also myriad local press articles like these from the Pittsburgh Press on December
364380	369220	10th that also contradict the military's denial of a presence at Kecksburg.
369220	374340	The description of Air Force men may be paramount to investigating this crash recovery case.
374460	379980	Referred to as blue berets, Leonard Stringfield made numerous mentions to a UFO crash recovery
379980	385420	intelligence team stemming from the Air Force donned in blue fatigues and blue berets.
385420	390140	In crash retrievals of the third kind, a case study of alleged UFOs and occupants in military
390140	391140	custody.
391140	395580	Stringfield stated he had been made aware from other military forces of a rapid reaction
395580	401220	special forces unit named blue berets who can quote, operate secretly and effectively
401220	405540	by using diversionary tactics to prevent public interference, end quote.
405540	410500	This unit was housed at certain military bases as rapid reaction units in a constant state
410500	414460	of ready to address downed or crashed UFOs.
414460	418220	Stringfield even stated to have met a former member of the elite blue berets when visiting
418220	421660	the University of Dade City, Florida for a lecture quote.
421660	426040	We talked about the elite force, its makeup and functions and some of his experiences
426040	428740	in Vietnam behind enemy lines.
428740	432820	Although he had never participated in a UFO crash retrieval, he was aware that one of
432820	435740	his fellow members had the experience.
435740	440220	Details were scanty, but Cameron calls that his friend referred to his participation in
440220	444780	the recovery of a quote unquote big head from an alien craft and quote.
444780	449820	In UFO crash retrieval status report for fatal encounters at Fort Dix, McGuire Stringfield
449820	454580	met with a man named Jeff Morse who claimed to be a former blue beret.
454580	459940	Morse would tell Stringfield in 1985 to 1987 about an incident at Fort McGuire Air Force
459940	464940	Base in which a non-human entity was shot to death by US forces.
464940	469220	Quite a bit to discuss about the blue berets, so maybe we will save that for another video.
469220	473060	But I do want to mention Air Force blue berets were made famous with the creation of the
473060	480380	USAF 1041 security police squadron, which operated during 1965 to 1967.
480380	486140	The 1041s and their blue berets were implemented in Operation Safe Side in which the Air Force
486140	492440	deployed a highly trained unit of combat security police known as active defense to repel raids
492440	494480	on air bases in Vietnam.
494480	498420	But the origins of USAF personnel and blue fatigues and blue berets can be traced back
498420	503780	to 1956 with the creation of the strategic air command elite guard under General Curtis
503780	507140	LeMay, who I've spoken about many times.
507140	513580	The SAC elite guards operated as air police from 1956 to 1966 within the time of our Kecksburg
513580	517860	case, serving as part of the US Air Force and US Department of Defense.
517860	522180	The blue beret SAC elite guard were tasked with providing security at headquarters of
522180	524900	strategic air command of the US Air Force.
524900	529180	One such SAC base is Lockbourne Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio.
529180	532420	Remember the mention of this base as we will later discuss a witness who claimed to have
532420	536780	briefly guarded the crashed UAP from Kecksburg at Lockburn AFB.
536780	540700	Let's get back to Kecksburg and analyze the events around the time of an object crashing
540700	541940	in the woods.
541940	546940	With news media starting to swirl about stories of a fireball crashing in the area, local
546940	552620	news director John Murphy out of WHJB Greensburg, Pennsylvania received a call from a startled
552620	557340	mother who claimed she and her children had observed a fiery object fall into the woods
557340	560860	where a cloud of blue smoke began rising after impact.
588340	593380	Murphy, a key player in this story moving forward, arrived to the woods and investigated
593380	599020	the scene for some time before Carl Metz, a state police fire marshal, and another investigator
599020	600740	arrived to the scene.
600740	605180	The two investigators entered the woods and upon returning and being questioned by Murphy,
605180	610140	told Murphy, quote, you better get your information from the army, end quote.
610140	614820	Murphy would then arrive to the state police barracks in Greensburg for more information,
614820	618420	where he observed army and Air Force men swarming the location.
644820	668340	Murphy would interview many town residents about what they saw and experienced in Kecksburg
668340	673220	the evening of December 9th, and excitedly pieced together a radio documentary titled
673220	674900	Object in the Woods.
674900	679660	Curiously, Murphy's wife and other WHJB employees would state Murphy was approached
679660	683940	by men at the station leading to a radical alteration of his program.
683940	688700	Murphy would broadcast a heavily censored version of his documentary, starting the event
688700	690260	with an odd disclaimer.
703220	717100	And state that many witnesses whose testimony had been taped no longer wish to air their
717100	734460	statements due to fear of reprisals from the U.S. Army.
734460	763140	Stan Gordon would even go so far as to state he had received notarized documents from station
763140	768980	employees, claiming USG elements were confiscating news tapes of eyewitness accounts and were
768980	772540	not allowing said account to be broadcasted.
772540	776820	John Murphy would tragically die in a hit and run incident shortly after the event,
776820	780660	and never claimed publicly to have entered the woods and to have seen what crashed in
780660	781980	Kecksburg.
781980	786580	But in 2003, John's wife claimed he had told her of entering the woods and witnessed
786580	789780	a strange metallic object on the ground.
789780	794620	What was this object observed by so many and that later witnesses would state was transported
794620	799660	out of the woods in the early morning of December 10th by army trucks covered by a tarp.
799660	809180	Fortunately, we have numerous witness testimony to analyze.
809180	814020	There was no tail section, there was no motors, there was no windows, there was no doors.
814020	816700	There was big enough for a grown person to stand up in.
816700	821780	It had like Egyptian writing, like backwards writing on it, stars and circles and dashes
821780	823420	and lines and things like that.
823420	825620	It looked like an acorn.
825620	826620	It was really weird.
826620	831380	A first hand witness questioned at length by both Stan Gordon and Leonard Stringfield
831380	835420	is James, often referred to as Jim Romansky.
835420	839660	Romansky served as a volunteer fireman whose company was dispatched to Kecksburg to assist
839660	843580	with the search of what was thought to be a downed aircraft.
844060	847900	Romansky first approached Gordon in 1987 to tell his story.
847900	852780	He had previously feared ridicule for years, but wanted to finally give his testimony.
852780	858100	On the night of 1965, with the search teams combing the woods, Romansky heard via walkie
858100	861100	talkie the crash site had been discovered.
861100	866060	Upon arriving to the scene, the fireman witnessed an object half buried in the ground.
866060	870580	This object appeared to have descended into the forest at a 30 degree angle, breaking
870580	875140	tree limbs before impacting the ground and leaving a 25 foot long trench.
875140	877540	There were no signs of fire in the area.
877540	882260	I want you to describe what you saw when you arrived in this field where the supposed downed
882260	883260	aircraft was.
883260	889860	Well, first of all, we were in a field hunting for it as downed aircraft and the first rescue
889860	894140	team already found it and radioed into the fire hall, gave the coordinates and it was
894140	897340	down in front of us and we high-tailed it out of our search area and went down into
897340	898340	there.
898340	907660	And we got there expecting a smashed up airplane, wings, fuselage, etc., no such character.
907660	911460	Came down into the woods and here's its humongous piece of metal laying there.
911460	918100	I mean this thing, I've described time and time again as a very large, egg-corn shaped
918100	919860	object.
919860	924380	The front of it, or I presume was the front of it, was pushed down into the dirt where
924380	928060	the way it came in and landed after it took out the top of the trees and brush and everything
928060	929940	coming in.
929940	936220	Came back in an oblong shape, around the bottom was what I call a bumper and then the bottom
936220	939340	was perfectly flat, no signs of propulsion or anything.
939340	944100	There was no doors, no windows, there was no ways of getting in this thing, at least
944100	945500	none that I've seen.
945500	948980	There was no seams on it, no rivets, nothing.
948980	952340	The only thing I've seen was this bumper around it and had these real strange markings
952340	960340	on it which I've often referred to as similar to the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.
960340	967260	So as a volunteer fireman we did what we were supposed to do, find the crash site, do a preliminary
967260	971020	investigation for survivors who treated anybody which we didn't because there was none that
971020	972020	we could see.
972020	974180	There was no way of getting into this object.
974180	979180	The object appeared to be a large metallic acorn or bell measuring 10 to 12 feet in length,
979180	981100	8 to 10 feet in diameter.
981100	984780	The raised ring area measured about 8 to 10 inches wide.
984780	989820	The wingless, seamless and rivetless object was described as Romansky as a bronze off
989820	991340	gold color.
991340	995700	As a seasoned machinist, Romansky stated the object almost looked like it had been made
995700	1001300	from a liquid metal mold and told researcher Stan Gordon, quote, never in my life have
1001300	1005540	I seen the color of that metal in any shape or form, end quote.
1005540	1009220	The presence of the described hieroglyphic writing has been a point of contention for
1009220	1010700	the Kecksburg case.
1010700	1014980	With some believing the object to be a Soviet space capsule and the writing to be Russian
1014980	1019420	Cyrillic, Romansky described the writing as quote, characters of broken and straight
1019420	1022940	lines, dots, rectangles and circles, end quote.
1022940	1027100	Romansky would even explicitly state to Leonard Stringfield, he was familiar with the Russian
1027100	1030820	language and the markings he observed were not Russian.
1030820	1039300	My dad is originally from Kiev and I went to him one time and I said, dad, I says you
1039300	1043620	could read and write Polish and Russian, he says, yeah, I said, write me something in
1043620	1044620	both dialects.
1044620	1045620	He says, what?
1045620	1046980	I said, just write me anything.
1046980	1052420	The Polish and Russian writing that I seen doesn't come nowhere near.
1052420	1057980	I think it imperative to include much of Jim's testimony on the 1993 Montell-William show
1057980	1063100	due to his fiery and passionate demeanor and discussion of how his presence at the Kecksburg
1063100	1067460	case affected his children's time in the U.S. armed services.
1067460	1072020	The first team had already radioed in his position, were there 10, 15 minutes all talking
1072020	1077500	around doing a preliminary search, wondering what we discovered.
1077500	1084140	Two gentlemen come down through the woods, trench coats on, ramrod stiff, crew cut, alright,
1084140	1085500	this is a restricted area.
1085500	1088500	You're not ordered to get out of here, oh wait a minute, I'm a civilian.
1088500	1094100	You ain't going to order me nothing, but as a fireman I'm being relieved from what I'm
1094100	1095100	doing.
1095100	1096100	So I got out of there.
1096340	1101060	We're going out through the woods, we didn't go no more to 15, 20 feet, and I know from
1101060	1107060	me to you, here come the military, full uniforms, equipment, marching right down through the
1107060	1108060	woods with a flashlight.
1108060	1111940	This is December, late in the evening, it's cold, it's wet.
1111940	1114740	How far away were you from a military base?
1114740	1119740	Well, the closest base that I knew of was Pittsburgh, which is approximately 45 miles
1119740	1120740	to the west.
1120740	1125060	So, within 15 minutes of your arrival at the site, the military was there.
1125060	1126060	You got it.
1126060	1128860	Okay, alright, alright, now what did they say to you after this happened?
1128860	1132060	I mean, I know there were several members, the report I saw on Unsolved Mysteries, several
1132060	1135740	members of the community were there, right, other people were part of the community were
1135740	1138660	there and present and were all told to leave.
1138660	1143420	There was no press or media at the immediate crash site.
1143420	1149300	What I didn't know up on top of the hill, because I'd come in through the side, the
1149300	1155060	military had taken over a farmhouse, I mean from what I understand, military brass.
1155060	1162060	They took over up there, did all their orders and whatever they were doing from up there
1162060	1167540	and that's where I presume that the military who came down through the woods came from
1167540	1172060	because when we went out, we had to walk back to the fire hall, which was approximately
1172060	1177460	the way we had to go, I'd say a good mile, but by the time we got back to the fire hall,
1177460	1181940	it was wall to wall military, I mean there was trucks and jeeps and cars, there was guards
1181940	1182940	on the door.
1182940	1186420	Anybody said to you, I don't want you talking about this, don't say a word about this or
1186420	1193460	what they did, what they did, I mean these people virtually told us just to shut up,
1193460	1195660	get to your vehicles and be quiet.
1195660	1200500	I have a daughter and a son that both went into the military, within the last two or
1200500	1201500	three years.
1201500	1205220	One went into the Marine Corps, one went into U.S. Air Force.
1205220	1209500	My daughter come to me from the United States Marine Corps and she said, Dad, your name
1209500	1213540	can come up on a computer as my father, I had to sign a statement saying I would never
1213540	1219220	ask a request for any information from Kecksburg, my son had to sign two statements.
1219220	1220220	About you, about yourself?
1220220	1221220	Pardon?
1221220	1223420	Any information about yourself?
1223420	1226260	Your daughter had to sign a paper that says she would not ask for any information about
1226260	1227260	you?
1227260	1231220	Not about me, but about Kecksburg, because my name would come up as her father.
1231220	1232220	Okay, but you know what?
1232220	1237860	Then, no wait a minute Montel, then my son in the U.S. Air Force had to sign two papers.
1237860	1241340	Jim, wait, get to, just jump to the chase, because part of the chase here is the fact
1241340	1244340	that I spent, I'm telling you, I had some of the highest clearances this country has
1244340	1245340	to offer.
1245340	1249540	I've been through files on top of files on top of files, I still ain't seen nothing
1249540	1250540	yet.
1250540	1251540	Period.
1251540	1252540	Period.
1252540	1253540	Period.
1253540	1254540	You didn't have the need to know.
1254540	1255540	Yeah, but that's also not true.
1255540	1258660	Now my son goes in the Air Force and they tell him he can't even request to go to Wright
1258660	1263980	Patterson Air Force base for duty, because I seen something and that's where my UFO was
1263980	1264980	sent today.
1264980	1268900	Maybe his M.O.S. was something that they didn't have a qualification for it, right
1268900	1269900	pattern.
1269900	1270900	His M.O.S. has nothing to do with it.
1270900	1271900	Okay, all right, hold on a minute.
1271900	1275180	The government is covering this up, they don't want no one to know, they don't want no one
1275180	1279980	to get access to anything, because they're afraid people will find out the truth.
1279980	1284300	During his time spent with Stan Gordon, Romansky would take the researcher to the exact site
1284300	1285620	of the crash.
1285620	1290900	This site would line up identically to the description of our next witness, Bill Bullybush,
1290900	1295020	due to the best of our knowledge had no interaction with Romansky.
1295020	1300300	Bill Bullybush was driving his car in the afternoon of December 9th, 1965, where he observed
1300300	1302980	the object streaking over the sky.
1302980	1307300	Bill stated, quote, the object appeared to hesitate over the Loraville area, then made
1307300	1311580	a turn and then began to travel northeast towards Kecksburg, end quote, where he then
1311580	1313420	saw it descending.
1313420	1317020	Witnessing the object's descent, Bill turned his car and went to the top of the hill now
1317020	1321900	called Meteor Road, where he observed blue lights flashing in the woods.
1321900	1326180	As the sky was getting dark, Bullybush claimed to walk into the woods to the crash site, where
1326180	1330940	he looked upon a metallic acorn shaped object embedded into the soil.
1330940	1336460	The object featured the same strange writing noticed by Romansky, and Bullybush noted blue
1336460	1349940	arcing light emanating from the object at intervals.
1349940	1355940	Bullybush's description of the object supports the theory that it was probably not a meteorite.
1355940	1361460	I was working on a 64 Corvair at home.
1361460	1368980	I happened to see this red ball of fire going across, get come up and went towards the mountain,
1368980	1371500	just like if it was radio controlled.
1371500	1377300	It made a figure eight, and it came right down in here, and Bully landed right in here,
1377300	1380660	knocked the top of the trees out.
1380660	1383260	It stunk like rotten eggs.
1383260	1384260	You could smell it.
1384740	1389260	And then just like sizzling and like sparks coming, just like if it was cooling off, it
1389260	1390580	was red hot.
1390580	1394540	Bullybush is the only witness I'm aware of to describe the presence of a smell.
1394540	1399460	The description of a strong smell, in this case rotten eggs, a.k.a. a sulfuric smell,
1399460	1404740	reminds me closely of the strong ammonia smell witnesses described in the 1997 Virginia
1404740	1405740	Brazil case.
1405740	1410500	Bill Bullybush, who fled the woods when he heard the fireman approaching, independently
1410500	1413380	described a nearly identical object.
1413380	1414740	I could see it.
1414740	1415740	Pretty good.
1415740	1421700	There was no welding, no windows, no nothing on it, and none on the back was a ring, and
1421700	1426860	it had like Egyptian writing on it, and I couldn't figure out what it was.
1426860	1430340	From his statements, we can piece together, Bullybush left the scene upon the arrival
1430340	1434700	of the fire crew, who witnessed the object for a span of 15 minutes until the men described
1434700	1437500	by Romansky ordered the fireman to leave.
1437500	1441620	And we do have a witness who states he observed the craft and retrieval crew departing the
1441620	1442620	woods.
1442620	1447940	In the early 1990s, I witnessed Jerry Betters, a Pittsburgh jazz musician, came forward with
1447940	1449340	his testimony.
1449340	1455940	At 41 years old in 1965, Betters lived near the area of Kecksburg in a town called Murrisville.
1455940	1460620	Jerry noticed the now infamous fireball, which agitated the horses he was feeding and surrounding
1460620	1462060	dogs.
1462060	1466340	Upon hearing the news report of the object crashing in Kecksburg, Jerry phoned his friends
1466340	1469820	to pick him up and head to the town for a look.
1469820	1472820	Later with the area, the men found themselves on a private lane.
1472820	1477420	After rounding a slight turn, Jerry stated he was halted by a military roadblock.
1477420	1482180	The soldiers halting traffic appeared to wear army fatigues with cloth berets, but other
1482180	1487300	soldiers equipped with rifles and helmets stood at attention behind the roadblock.
1487300	1492060	Betters noticed a number of quote unquote military brass officers, well-dressed civilians,
1492060	1496140	and scattered army star emblazoned jeeps and personnel trucks.
1496140	1499860	Jerry's attention was commanded towards a large cab and flatbed trailer.
1499860	1504700	He noticed a domed or acorn-shaped object that was uncovered and being hauled away from
1504700	1505700	the woods.
1505700	1508780	Quickly, a tarp was placed over the object.
1508780	1512380	Betters noted the truck seemed to have trouble traversing up through the field.
1512380	1517140	Jerry Betters also described the truck and his encounter in a notarized document.
1542380	1570780	We
1570780	1575580	do have other witnesses who claim to have been held at gunpoint by the attending military
1575580	1576580	forces.
1576580	1605060	The individual is local resident David Newhouse.
1605060	1618540	In fact, there are dozens of witness testimony from Kecksburg locals and nearby citizens
1618540	1620880	we could analyze all day.
1620880	1625600	Like that of then teenager Bill Weaver, who noticed four men exit a light-colored box
1625600	1631060	truck dressed in quote unquote moon suits and head towards the crash area, or then 14-year-old
1631060	1636220	Mike Slater, who stated an army officer told Mike and his friend they could do a great
1636220	1641420	service to their country by sending curious crash seekers wrong directions.
1641420	1646180	We even have witnesses who state they observed the craft after it was taken out of the field,
1646180	1652900	and we will address these shortly.
1652900	1658020	A bell-shaped craft big enough to fit a man with strange hieroglyphic writing was described
1658020	1662700	by many civilian witnesses the night of December 9th, 1965.
1662700	1666380	It is interesting how Blue Book contended the object was a meteor and that nothing was
1666380	1671740	found at the crash site after all of the witness testimony and trajectory and speed calculations
1671740	1676780	conducted while the object was in the air that are not consistent with meteor travel.
1676780	1681100	As mentioned earlier, Blue Book did receive some fragmented material that was seen to
1681100	1685180	fall off of the craft, sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
1685300	1689940	Blue Book declared this material as chaff, which is quote, material dropped by aircraft
1689940	1695300	to confuse radar complexes when participating in interdiction exercises, end quote.
1695300	1699820	The conclusion of a meteor with presence of this said chaff leads to further inconsistencies
1699820	1701740	in Blue Book's reporting.
1701740	1705700	Early skeptics of Kecksburg stated the craft may have been the remains of Soviet spacecraft
1705700	1707300	Cosmos 96.
1707300	1713020	This conclusion was not supported in a 1965 NASA press release, which stated Cosmos 96
1713020	1718180	had decayed and landed in Canada roughly 13 hours prior to the Kecksburg event.
1718180	1723260	This NASA briefing says, quote, other analyses of the spacecraft orbit definitively indicate
1723260	1727260	it could not have been the Cosmos 96 spacecraft, end quote.
1727260	1731660	Stan Gordon further concluded the Kecksburg event was not the result of Cosmos 96 when
1731660	1735700	he received documents through FOIA requests from both the U.S. Space Command and Naval
1735700	1741220	Surveillance Center, which verified Cosmos 96 entered the atmosphere at roughly 3.18
1742020	1746380	Eastern Standard Time over Canada on December 9, 1965.
1746380	1750940	Some such as NASA mission specialist James Oberg maintained the object was a capsule
1750940	1754620	of Soviet origin recovered in secrecy for its heat shielding.
1754620	1759700	Joining us now from Houston is spaceflight engineer and author James Oberg, who has studied
1759700	1764140	the reported sighting in Kecksburg and has his own theory about what landed there in
1764140	1766140	1965.
1766220	1772340	Mr. Oberg, first of all, do you believe that something crashed in Kecksburg in 1965 and
1772340	1774180	was it a UFO?
1774180	1777820	If it's anything, it might be something a lot more Earth-like.
1777820	1781020	It might be a spacecraft from Russia and not from Mars.
1781020	1785700	It turns out we do know that a Russian probe fell back to Earth that day, and it was a
1785700	1786860	special kind of probe.
1786860	1789020	It was one of their probes to the planet Venus.
1789020	1792740	It failed, was trapped in Earth orbit, and eventually fell out of orbit.
1792740	1796940	What might have been on that Russian space probe that the U.S. would have been so interested
1796940	1797940	in?
1797940	1801540	Oh, the most important thing about the probe would be the heat shield, how thick it was,
1801540	1805900	what material it was made out of, how heavy it was, and once we knew that, we could then
1805900	1809180	analyze how big their warheads would be in their ICBMs.
1809180	1814580	But in this clip, it is necessary to mention Oberg is still mentioning Cosmos 96.
1814580	1820100	Others have wondered if the craft was indeed a Gemini or Orion capsule expelled in the area,
1820100	1825020	such as Assistant Chief of Kecksburg Fire Department Jim Mays, who got within 75 yards
1825020	1827580	of the object but didn't get a clear view.
1827580	1831940	But the idea of a man-made space capsule crashing into the Midwest of the continental
1831940	1837820	United States was further discredited in this May 2000 Leslie Keen conference titled, Combating
1837820	1843420	Media Ridicule and Searching for Evidence on the 1965 Kecksburg Crash Case.
1843420	1849100	Some of you may know journalist Leslie Keen as the writer of the 2017 New York Times article
1849100	1854300	bringing the Pentagon UAP videos and OSAP slash ATIP to the public zeitgeist.
1854300	1859100	In this conference, Keen discussed her correspondence with Nicholas Johnson, NASA Chief Scientist
1859100	1862460	for Orbital Debris at the NASA Johnson Space Center.
1862460	1867980	Johnson analyzed the orbital data of the Soviet Venus probe Cosmos 96 and determined the object
1867980	1872820	could not have landed in Kecksburg near 5 p.m. December 9, 1965.
1872820	1877620	Furthermore, Johnson stated no man-made space object landed in Pennsylvania on the day of
1877620	1878620	the crash.
1878620	1883940	So I was able to contact an important scientist from NASA, probably the leading expert in
1883940	1888900	the world on this issue and he was named Nicholas Johnson, he's the Chief Scientist for Orbital
1888900	1891220	Debris at the NASA Johnson Space Center.
1891220	1896500	He was able to obtain the coordinates of Cosmos 96 so that he could calculate if part of it
1896500	1900620	had kept stayed in orbit after the crash that happened that morning, could it have landed
1900620	1905100	in Pennsylvania and he was able to determine absolutely not, made the statement for us
1905100	1908540	that it is impossible that that could have been Cosmos 96.
1908540	1913540	And the more interesting statement he made was that in fact there is no man-made object
1913540	1919380	that came down over Pennsylvania at 5 o'clock on that day, there's no man-made object and
1919380	1924260	he said that he has the databases and the knowledge to determine, even if it had been
1924260	1927140	some kind of secret experiment he would be aware of it.
1927140	1931980	He was also able to eliminate the project Corona which was a project that was dropping
1931980	1938260	these canisters, it was sending out these spy satellites to Russia, photographing things
1938260	1943140	from the sky flying back over the United States and dropping canisters which were then retrieved.
1943140	1946340	Some people have thought that that might have been what it was, he was also able to eliminate
1946340	1947340	that.
1947340	1951340	Keen's work on retrieving official Kecksburg documents is truly fascinating.
1951340	1956740	In the early 2000s working with the Coalition of Freedom of Information, CFI, Keen took
1956740	1963460	legal action towards NASA for stonewalling files on Kecksburg and in 2007 she won.
1963460	1968140	A settlement in October of 2007 required NASA to provide hundreds of never-before-seen
1968140	1972660	documents to Keen and CFI while paying all legal fees.
1972660	1976740	NASA's search for documents on the craft was completed by August 2009, where NASA
1976740	1982820	posted 220 pages of Moondust documents with zero relation to Kecksburg.
1982820	1987140	According to a NASA Public Affairs document, quote, NASA sent its files to the National
1987140	1990940	Archives for Safekeeping two years after the Kecksburg incident.
1990940	1996500	In 1996, the National Archives told NASA that the files had been marked as lost since
1996500	1999020	1987, end quote.
1999020	2002500	We won't spend any time on Moondust, but if you have never heard of the program I
2002500	2006860	highly recommend watching my video on Moondust which covers this program in depth along with
2006860	2012380	its fellow programs UFO and Blue Fly, tasked with recovering descended foreign space vehicles
2012380	2014020	during the Cold War.
2014020	2019520	It is a very strange convenience that files relating to Kecksburg were lost forever.
2019520	2024500	But let's explore what witnesses like Romansky, Bullybush, Betters, and myriad other witnesses
2024500	2049240	describe crashing into the woods that cold evening.
2049240	2053480	Many will remember when I covered this infographics crash retrieval operator video that contained
2053480	2056260	a fascinating first-hand testimony.
2056260	2062160	Very rarely do well-known UFO sightings describe a bell or acorn-shaped craft, certainly not
2062160	2066920	one that is bronze, 10 to 12 feet high with strange writing along the base.
2066920	2071160	But as it turns out, there are a wealth of similar sightings we can analyze.
2071160	2076800	Let's take a look at this December 2, 1952 Blue Book case into Quincy, Louisiana, where
2076800	2082320	multiple eyewitnesses observed an acorn-shaped object emitting pink, green, red, and yellow
2082320	2086960	lights moving up and down in altitude for a period of two and a half hours.
2086960	2092240	We can also analyze this November 10, 1956 Blue Book case in Massachusetts, where both
2092240	2097680	civilian and military sources observed an acorn shape featuring a white base, red side,
2097680	2099040	and green glow.
2099040	2102680	Blue Book labeled this case as probably the planet Venus.
2102680	2108160	On August 23, 1957, Blue Book reported a sighting of a bell-shaped object climb and
2108160	2111280	move out of eyesight of observers in New Jersey.
2111280	2116320	The case was explained away as a weather balloon from Philadelphia Municipal Airport.
2116320	2121600	Around the time of Kecksburg, November 1965 to be exact, residents in Manhattan, New York
2121600	2126760	reported to Blue Book of a bell-shaped UFO hovering above Manhattan during an electricity
2126760	2128140	blackout.
2128140	2132080	There are over half a dozen other Blue Book cases I can reference off the top of my head
2132280	2137720	like a 7-8 foot bell changing colors in 1965 seen over Bunky, Louisiana.
2137720	2142360	In the video description, you can find additional Blue Book cases featuring bell or acorn-shaped
2142360	2148200	UFOs from 1957, 1954, 1965, and 1957.
2148200	2152280	But I would like to draw your attention to a now-deleted Reddit entry titled, quote,
2152280	2158240	I worked on a team that dealt with NHI technology and left in 2018, end quote.
2158240	2163440	This alleged Reddit whistleblower is another in a long line of enigmatic, anonymous individuals
2163440	2168320	who make astonishing claims on Reddit, 4chan, or other message boards before deleting their
2168320	2174040	profiles, leaving users debating endlessly to the validity of their entries.
2174040	2178680	I will save exploring this testimony for a full video as I find this post fascinating,
2178680	2183240	but to summarize this post, the leaker became disgruntled and sought to vent about his career
2183240	2188080	within an agency that dealt with issues related to non-human intelligence.
2188080	2191600	One paragraph of this perplexing post caught my attention, quote,
2191600	2196360	Later I worked in a facility, within a facility, just like the one I had tried to inspect.
2196360	2198160	It stored a craft.
2198160	2202640	Being near the craft for extended periods of time is extremely dangerous, especially if
2202640	2205000	it is being experimented on with power.
2205000	2210320	I didn't observe any injuries to anyone while I was there, but all sorts of long-term nasty
2210320	2213960	injuries were relayed to me through rumors and warnings.
2213960	2217080	The craft was shaped like a dreidel without the handle.
2217080	2220840	There was a large exterior piece that went missing when it was recovered.
2220840	2227600	The theory is it acted as a stabilizer, although some argue it was a crude weapon, end quote.
2227600	2230560	Before we break this down, the anonymous poster also said, quote,
2230560	2233200	The shape was directly informed by its purpose.
2233200	2237080	Every shape is custom-molded in a metallic material that would revolutionize the way
2237080	2239620	we travel if we had it, end quote.
2239620	2243720	This method of molding sounds extremely similar to the statements of first-hand Kecksburg
2243720	2255880	witness and machinist Jim Romansky.
2255880	2260960	Discussion of peril to human bodies and cognition when in proximity to UAP is being heavily
2260960	2266840	explored in 2024, and has even been mentioned in a graphic in Lou Elizondo's book Eminent.
2266840	2271360	The craft description, a dreidel without its handle, sounds almost identical to the craft
2271360	2275240	Romansky, Bully Bush, Betters, and others described.
2275240	2280360	The Reddit user also states a large exterior piece went missing when the craft was recovered.
2280360	2285280	While remember back to our 1965 fireball, witnesses discussed pieces falling off of
2285280	2287600	the blazing fireball in the sky.
2287600	2291720	Blue Book even claimed to have retrieved pieces of chaff from the object.
2291720	2297200	Interesting, I am once again drawn to whistleblower Stephen Lovekin, who claimed a special classified
2297200	2301480	portion of Blue Book had actually recovered debris from the Roswell wreckage.
2301480	2306360	Lastly, the writing described as hieroglyphics reminds me of three other cases.
2306360	2311320	The writing on the Roswell debris described by primary witness Jesse Marcel Sr.
2311320	2316720	The writing along the lip of a craft craft, Danny Sheehan observed photos of, in the classified
2316720	2320240	files of Blue Book while under order from President Jimmy Carter.
2320240	2324640	And the writings that appeared to project off of what was considered recovered weapon technology
2324640	2333440	by witness RA at the Offworld Technologies Division.
2333440	2338560	I will discuss Dr. Eric A. Walker only briefly as I have already covered him in my majestic
2338560	2343280	documents project with Ryan Wood and in my Robert Sarbacher and the early days of the
2343280	2345400	UFO crash retrieval video.
2345400	2349920	Robert Sarbacher, physicist and member of the U.S. Joint Research and Development Board
2349920	2355480	named Dr. Eric A. Walker in an interview with Stanton Freedman, implicating Dr. Walker as
2355480	2361400	an integral member to UFO crash retrieval and UFO study alongside Dr. Vannevar Bush.
2361400	2368200	Dr. Eric A. Walker was the president of Penn State University from 1956 to 1971, a member
2368200	2372480	of many defense boards including chairman of the Institute for Defense Analysis and the
2372480	2377520	executive secretary of the Defense Research Board from 1950 to 1951.
2377520	2382560	Throughout the 1980s, Walker would be contacted by numerous UFO researchers, such as William
2382560	2387600	Steinman and Habib Henry Asadahel, a pseudonym for Armin Victorian.
2387600	2392160	Walker would confirm attendance at meetings centered on UFO crash and body retrieval efforts
2392160	2398920	in 1949 to 1950, discuss the validity of MJ-12, comment on the difficulty of breakthroughs
2398920	2403680	in UFO reverse engineering and make all sorts of cryptic statements on needing to understand
2403680	2407040	ESP to become involved with UFO programs.
2407040	2410960	Let's break down this conversation between Armin Victorian and Walker, where Kecksburg
2410960	2416160	is referenced, and before we do an interesting note, primary Kecksburg researcher Stan Gordon
2416160	2421360	did state there was a report of someone fitting Dr. Walker's description at the crash site.
2421360	2425240	In the interview, Walker states he went to the Kecksburg crash site with two men from
2425240	2427480	the military that were not on duty.
2427480	2430600	He also went with a fellow colleague of his.
2430600	2435360	When asked if it was a UFO recovered, Walker states, quote, I cannot comment on that.
2435360	2438120	I cannot tell you, end quote.
2438120	2442160	Walker would not comment on if he was at the crash site for long, but did state he and
2442160	2445400	the other men did not prepare any reports.
2445400	2447720	Two men from the military, but not on duty.
2447720	2453320	So we can rule out here that these were the three USAF Blue Book personnel from the 662nd
2453320	2456080	radar squadron dispatched to the crash site.
2456080	2460960	Could Walker and his mentioned off-duty military companions possibly be the men in civilian
2460960	2465840	clothes referenced by numerous eyewitnesses or possibly the men in trench coats who ordered
2465840	2469160	Romansky and the firemen away from the UFO?
2469160	2472960	And we must ask, why did Walker not prepare any reports?
2472960	2478120	Can we take Walker's refusal to comment on the presence of a UFO as an admission that
2478120	2482320	non-human technology did in fact crash in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania?
2482320	2487040	And last part here, Walker mentions a colleague of his accompanying him to the crash site.
2487040	2492400	In 1965, Walker was serving as president of Pennsylvania State University, a shadowy
2492400	2494840	witness I covered and spoke to as TB.
2494840	2499880	I highly recommend watching my UFO witness list redacted video to analyze his entire
2499880	2500880	story.
2500880	2506680	According to alleged emails with Dr. Stephen Greer, TB stated UFO program USAPs, unacknowledged
2506680	2513120	special access programs, are embedded within UARCs, university affiliated research centers
2513120	2514960	for the Department of Defense.
2514960	2520760	As it turns out, Pennsylvania State University does indeed have a UARC, the Applied Research
2520760	2522960	Laboratory for the US Navy.
2522960	2527280	In fact, Walker would help create the Applied Research Center at the behest of the US Navy
2527280	2533160	in 1945 following World War II, where Dr. Walker moved 100 engineers from Harvard to Penn
2533160	2534360	State.
2534360	2540720	Not only was this ARL awarded the largest research contract in Penn State history, $2.1 billion
2540720	2541720	from the Navy.
2541800	2547720	The ARL also currently specializes in prototyping novel power and energy systems, electrooptics
2547720	2549400	and directed energy.
2549400	2554200	Could Walker and his colleague have been tasked with investigating the Kexburg crash for UAP
2554200	2559880	programs stemming from Penn State University's Affiliated Research Center, the Applied Research
2559880	2561720	Laboratory?
2561720	2572520	In his 2024 book Eminent, Lou Elizondo named Lyndon B. Johnson amongst Truman, Eisenhower,
2572520	2578280	JFK, Carter, Reagan, H.W. Bush, and Trump, as presidents who were briefed into sum to
2578280	2580640	all of the UFO phenomenon.
2580640	2585200	This statement by Elizondo plus his relationship with Dr. Eric Walker, who self-admitted he
2585200	2589720	was present at the Kexburg crash, leads us to do some serious investigation into Lyndon
2589720	2595040	B. Johnson, who served in office from 1963 to 1969.
2595040	2601040	We can see in the luncheon in the White House, dated August 3, 1964, Eric A. Walker amongst
2601040	2604640	other colleague presidents met with Lyndon B. Johnson.
2604640	2609040	Walker was also the only university president to be invited by Johnson to attend the Clean
2609040	2613120	Air Act signing in the White House in 1967.
2613120	2618040	But we can also find a handful of letters between Walker and Johnson, such as this September
2618040	2623880	10, 1964 letter in which the president writes Walker thanking him profusely for his service
2623880	2628240	as a member of the Board of Visitors to the U.S. Military Academy.
2628240	2632800	Some unreferenced actions recommended by Walker were to be instated by the Secretary of Defense
2632800	2634520	at Johnson's request.
2634520	2638920	This report very well may have nothing to do with UAP, but Johnson and Walker were close
2638920	2641520	enough to exchange personal letters.
2641520	2647520	Let's also analyze the September 24, 1964 letter addressed to Dr. Walker from Johnson,
2647520	2652440	Dr. Walker to personally recommend a university student to honor as a young leader.
2652440	2658120	Or how about this May 18, 1966 letter dated after the Kecksburg incident in which Johnson
2658120	2663040	again profusely thanks Walker for his service as a member and chairman of the National Science
2663040	2664200	Board.
2664200	2668520	One Dr. Hornig is mentioned here, pay attention to that name for later.
2668520	2672960	In this letter, Lyndon B. Johnson cryptically says, quote, I should also like to thank you
2672960	2677680	for the unstinting manner in which you served your government in other areas, including
2677680	2681840	your recent tenure as a board of the Defense Science Board, end quote.
2681840	2686720	Just how deep was this relationship between the president and a man associated with USG
2686720	2688720	crash retrieval efforts?
2688720	2693020	Johnson also had a provable interest in UFOs during his time in the U.S. Senate before
2693020	2694280	his presidency.
2694280	2699320	In this article titled, Lyndon B. Johnson Calls for UFO Alert, we can see Johnson attempted
2699320	2705000	to institute a military subcommittee to report UFO sightings personally to him.
2705000	2709880	Johnson even wrote to Major Donald Kehoe, an excellent ufologist and author of the Flying
2709880	2716340	Saucer Conspiracy in 1960 thanking Kehoe for delivering documented evidence on UFOs.
2716340	2721520	With all of this interest in UFOs and his relationship with the shadowy Dr. Eric Walker,
2721520	2727280	what was Johnson doing during and after the December 9, 1965 Kecksburg event and how much
2727280	2728880	did he know?
2728880	2734080	In his 2024 release of all of his research files, Grant Cameron has supplied incredibly
2734080	2738960	crucial documents discussing Johnson's actions and meetings around the time of the Kecksburg
2738960	2740080	crash.
2740080	2746040	Here we find President Lyndon B. Johnson's schedule for December 9 through the 11, 1965.
2746040	2750440	Since the time of the Kecksburg event occurred around 4 to 5 p.m. Eastern Standard, we will
2750440	2755000	begin to analyze late appointments on the 9th and meetings the following day.
2755000	2759520	The evening of December 9, the President seemed to partake in many leisure activities,
2759520	2764000	dinner, driving around the Texas White House, watching the evening news, etc.
2764000	2769280	On the morning of December 10, 9.50 to be exact, solely an hour after waking, we see
2769280	2773800	a massive roster of guests arrive for an exhausting day of meetings.
2773800	2778940	The arrivals include the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or JCS as I'll refer to them, the Secretary
2778940	2784880	and Undersecretary of Defense, doctors such as the aforementioned Dr. Donald Hornig,
2784880	2789720	high-up USG officials, NASA Director James Webb, and more.
2789720	2795720	While no meetings this day make explicit mention of Kecksburg, Soviet spy satellites or ICBMs,
2795720	2800200	every single one of these names offer crucial insight and a key piece to the puzzle of the
2800200	2806360	Kecksburg mystery, and the possibility of a red-in President addressing a pressing UFO
2806360	2807840	crash retrieval.
2807840	2812100	Almost immediately upon the guests' arrival, the President began his meetings for over
2812100	2816460	two hours from 10.10 a.m. to 12.51 p.m.
2816460	2821580	Johnson met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bill Moyers, Joe Califano, Secretary McNamara,
2821580	2822820	and Secretary Vance.
2822820	2827100	There is a lot to break down here as each name warrants investigation.
2827100	2832900	The Joint Chiefs of Staff include US Navy Admiral Donald L. McDonald, who was in 1965
2832900	2838100	serving as the Chief of Naval Operations in General Wallace M. Green, commandant of the
2838100	2841940	US Marine Corps, not much to analyze about these gentlemen.
2841940	2847180	But during LBJ's presidency, USAF General J. P. McConnell served as Chief of Staff for
2847180	2848860	the US Air Force.
2848860	2855660	Upon taking his position on February 1, 1965, he relieved General Curtis LeMay.
2855660	2859980	If that name sounds familiar, we have discussed LeMay earlier in this video and at length
2859980	2865020	as the General who denied Senator Barry Goldwater to the Blue Room at Wright-Patterson Air Force
2865020	2870780	Base, and congratulated Harry B. Cooper for his work on the quote-unquote UFO program.
2870780	2874300	LeMay's ties to ufology are vast.
2874300	2879380	Also among the JCS was US Army General Earl Wheeler, who sat as the Chairman for the Joint
2879380	2884220	Chiefs of Staff, worth noting Wheeler shot to the top of the ranks of the US military
2884220	2889500	without much combat experience, eliciting criticism from many including none other than
2889500	2894420	General Curtis LeMay, who called Wheeler quote, Paulie Parrot, end quote.
2894420	2898820	A small detail worth noting after the meeting all of the Chiefs of Staff took a car ride
2898820	2902180	with Johnson, all but the under-qualified Wheeler.
2902180	2907000	The last Chief of Staff present in the early meetings is General Harold K. Johnson, Chief
2907000	2908980	of Staff for the US Army.
2908980	2913220	Johnson spearheaded the Eighth Calvary Regiment, which in Vietnam was a component of the First
2913220	2914700	Calvary Division.
2914700	2918820	The division I suspected in the Infographics whistleblower video to contain the soldiers
2918820	2921220	who witnessed the crashed UAP.
2921220	2926260	These Joint Chiefs of Staff were all overly qualified to be associated with the program
2926260	2930780	and briefed Johnson on the crashed UFO from the evening before, but this trail goes even
2930780	2931780	deeper.
2931780	2935900	As previously mentioned, including in the morning meetings were Bill Moyers, the personal
2935900	2941220	assistant to Lyndon B. Johnson, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Deputy Secretary
2941220	2946300	of Defense Cyrus Vance, and Naval Veteran Special Assistant of the Secretary and Deputy
2946300	2949380	Secretary of Defense Joe Califano.
2949380	2953580	Califano would attend many of the meetings with Johnson the day of the 10th, but here
2953580	2958500	let's make special notice to Califano's duty as a member of the Federal Radiation
2958500	2959500	Council.
2959500	2964460	Califano had a history of dealing with aerial collisions and crashes that required the Atomic
2964460	2970420	Energy Commission's involvement, such as this December 4th and 5th 1965 case of a midair
2970420	2972020	aircraft collision.
2972020	2976900	What is interesting to note here is a subsequent off-record meeting with Califano and Buford
2976900	2982940	Ellington, Director of the Office of Emergency Planning on December 13th, 1965, four days
2982940	2984300	after Kecksburg.
2984300	2988620	Why was this off-record meeting sent to Grant Cameron from the Lyndon B. Johnson Library
2988620	2991740	and Museum considered off-record?
2991740	2996660	Following the JCS car ride excluding Wheeler, the guests engaged in lunch before Johnson
2996660	3002620	met with McNamara, Vance, Bill Moyers, and Dr. Donald Hornig, as well as Secretary Orville
3002620	3003860	Freeman.
3003860	3008620	Donald Hornig served as Presidential Science Advisor to Johnson after also serving the
3008620	3010700	late John F. Kennedy Jr.
3010700	3015940	The Presidential Science Advisor was a position first held by Dr. Vannevar Bush to Franklin
3015940	3018220	D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman.
3018220	3021580	This should ring a bell to anybody familiar with the majestic documents.
3021580	3026740	The last member of this post-lunch meeting included Secretary Orville Freeman, U.S. Secretary
3026740	3031480	of Agriculture under Johnson from 1961 to 1969.
3031480	3036020	Why would a former Marine and Secretary of Agriculture be present at a meeting with three
3036020	3039720	Secretaries of Defense and the Science Advisor to the President?
3039720	3044600	What is even weirder here is the presence of James Webb alongside an Undersecretary
3044600	3045600	of Agriculture.
3045600	3051800	I take you to July 9th, 1947, just two days after the Roswell crash, where James Webb,
3051800	3056200	sitting as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, made late evening calls to Norris
3056200	3059260	E. Dodd, Undersecretary of Agriculture.
3059260	3063860	This may very well be a stretch here, but we must pursue all research angles, was Webb
3063860	3068180	discussing the Roswell event with Dodd and do positions like Secretary of Agriculture
3068180	3071940	entwine more with UAP programs than we might think.
3071940	3076220	I won't spend too much more time on the meetings as we have already discussed the significance
3076220	3079620	of most of the members in their grouping, and I have glossed over some of the other
3079620	3084540	interesting players like Dr. Glenn Seaborg, who was a Nobel Prize winning chemist and
3084540	3088620	atomic energy chairman, from 1961 to 1971.
3088620	3093620	I could make an entire video on the significance of this day of meetings, but the JCS and every
3093620	3098540	single individual summoned to Johnson's Texas residence the day after Kecksburg holds
3098540	3108980	massive importance and possibly signifies a day of briefings and meetings on the crash.
3108980	3113380	To further our investigation of Kecksburg, we can analyze multiple witnesses claiming
3113380	3117780	to have observed the Kecksburg bell after it was dragged from the woods that cold winter
3117780	3118780	night.
3118780	3124460	One such witness contacted Stan Gordon before the airing of a 1990 Unsolved Mysteries broadcast
3124460	3130020	on Kecksburg and provided detailed information on his experience with the Kecksburg craft.
3130020	3134260	According to this witness, as a member of the Air Force security team at Lockborn Air
3134260	3139140	Force Base near Columbus, Ohio, he guarded the object on the early morning of December
3139140	3145060	10, 1965, after the object had been transported from Pennsylvania.
3145060	3149140	According to this witness, after arriving on a truck, the craft was backed into a hangar
3149140	3152380	and security was greatly tightened around the base.
3152380	3157100	The object whose description matched the 10-12 foot bronze bell apparently stayed at the
3157100	3162020	base only a short time the morning of the 10th, before being transported to Wright-Patterson
3162020	3164300	Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio.
3164300	3168340	And we do have witnesses who claim to have observed the bell at Wright-Patt.
3168340	3173780	This witness, Myron, first contacted Stan Gordon after the airing of the 1990 Unsolved Mysteries
3173780	3179100	broadcast and was interviewed and investigated by the legendary Leonard Stringfield.
3179100	3183620	The trucker claimed the only reason he would discuss his experience was due to thinking,
3183620	3188660	quote, it would be okay to discuss what he saw since it was now on TV, end quote.
3188660	3192060	The word of Stringfield carries much weight for myself and others.
3192060	3196420	And regarding Myron, Stringfield stated in UFO crash retrievals, the Inner Sanctum status
3196420	3201860	reports six, quote, after a number of lengthy interviews and getting his testimony on videotapes
3201860	3207740	at his home by a medical friend and research associate, Dr. Brian Thompson, I feel convinced
3207740	3210660	of Myron's sincerity, end quote.
3210660	3213900	Stringfield's analysis of Kecksburg would remain extremely balanced.
3213900	3218740	We can take for example Stringfield's discussion of an insider known as Uncle, who spoke to
3218740	3225500	Stringfield through an intermediary, as noted in 1993 status report three, amassing the evidence.
3225500	3230860	Uncle told Stringfield he was on the right track with his research but cautioned of disinformation.
3230860	3236300	Among Uncle statements were claims of understanding alien biological structures, that UFOs were
3236300	3242220	of benign origin, and that the Kecksburg case involved a crashed spy plane, while the heavily
3242220	3247260	contested Fort Riley and Johannesburg, South Africa crash cases were true.
3247260	3251260	All this is to say that Stringfield did in fact note opinions against Kecksburg but
3251260	3254220	still pursued the case for well over a decade.
3254220	3258780	Anyways, back to Myron, as noted for the record by Stringfield, Myron stated he and
3258780	3264380	his cousin, J.S., worked for a family owned shale and tile brick business in Ohio.
3264380	3268380	Two or three days following the Kecksburg crash, the company was contracted for a large
3268380	3272420	order of special glazed bricks to Wright Patterson Air Force Base.
3272420	3276900	The customer, the U.S. Navy, according to Myron, sent a representative to the business
3276900	3279460	to select and inspect the bricks.
3279460	3283900	Myron claimed receipts of this transaction were lost when the business was sold to new
3283900	3284900	owners.
3284900	3289180	The specialty brick in question was a, quote, double glazed engineered brick, end quote.
3289180	3293260	Myron would later state the purpose of these bricks were to build a double thick, lead
3293260	3298580	lined protective structure around the Kecksburg UFO to protect against radiation.
3298580	3302740	The shipment of bricks was delivered at a designated gate where Myron and J.S. arrived
3302740	3304660	in different flatbed trucks.
3304660	3309360	Once outside Wright Pat, a two or three star general dressed in a blue uniform led the
3309360	3311780	delivery men to a warehouse ahead.
3311780	3316740	The destination for the bricks was a brick warehouse, 50 to 80 feet inside, accessible
3316740	3322180	by a narrow blacktop driveway surrounded by rows of offices and a power plant.
3322180	3327740	To quote Myron, nearby the building was a, quote, Army 35 foot long tri-axle lowboy
3327740	3330100	that I later learned transported the object.
3330100	3333820	A tarp was still draped over its midsection, end quote.
3333820	3338380	Myron noticed four or five frantic personnel outside the building, equipped with white
3338380	3344020	coveralls, visored headgear, rubber gloves and boots, and a Colt 45 pistol, quote, who
3344020	3347580	were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, end quote.
3347580	3351380	From Myron's point of view, the people inside the warehouse were solely concerned about the
3351380	3353260	object inside the building.
3353260	3357380	The personnel and delivery men unloaded the bricks by hand from trucks to pallets where
3357380	3362900	Myron noticed the men were navy, not air force by insignia on their uniforms.
3362900	3367020	During a break from unloading the shipment, Myron somehow managed to approach the warehouse's
3367020	3369700	door undetected and peer inside.
3369700	3374700	He observed metal scaffolding around a large, strange object with men at work.
3374700	3379300	Puzzling to Myron, parachute silks were suspended from the ceiling, partially enshrouding the
3379300	3383060	object, lit by one floodlight directed downward.
3383060	3388740	The object was bell shaped, measuring an estimated 10 feet tall and less than 10 feet wide, appearing
3388740	3395300	metallic with a dull copper or bronze color, but was charred or covered in a sooty residue.
3395300	3399500	During pursuing this mystery any further, irresistible, Myron asked one of the personnel
3399500	3402340	about his use of an acetylene torch.
3402340	3406460	Myron told Stringfield, quote, probably thinking that my presence there meant I had a proper
3406460	3407460	clearance.
3407460	3411900	The man who was wearing a visor told me he was trying to get inside, end quote.
3411900	3416460	Myron further explained to Stringfield the man told him all attempts to gain entry failed,
3416460	3419620	whether torch, diamond-headed drill bits, or acid.
3419620	3424620	This reminds me closely of the testimony of RB I covered in UFO whistleblowers, too,
3424620	3430140	who stated he guarded a hamburger-shaped saucer in 1963 for two weeks, where a science
3430140	3434980	team tried and failed with endless methods to gain entry to the craft.
3434980	3438340	Myron then went on to explain, quote, I was surprised when he told me that if there were
3438340	3443300	bodies inside, they might be too hot for the mortician to handle, end quote.
3443300	3447020	Bodies are always a contentious and interesting aspect of UAP retrieval.
3447020	3449540	We will address this point shortly.
3449540	3453740	Myron was then startled by the voice of a guard who said, forget what you've seen or
3453740	3457140	will lock you up and throw away the keys.
3457140	3463820	And we found the base, and they took us from the backside of the Wright-Patterson Air Base
3463820	3470620	all the way through the main part of the base, out the other side, down Maple Street, to
3470620	3476540	the old training center for World War II.
3476540	3479540	When I walked in and proceeded, I seen the bell shape.
3479540	3487020	It was sitting there on stelt, and it had a very big parachute or something draped down
3487020	3492020	over the top with a light up underneath the parachute, trying to cover this thing up so
3492020	3493700	no one could see it.
3493700	3498540	And you could see a ladder leaning against the bell before they were trying to get into
3498540	3502540	one of the openings.
3502540	3506740	And the guard said that he wasn't allowed to be in here, but how, I've already seen
3506740	3508580	everything in there.
3508580	3511540	So it didn't bother me when he ran me back out.
3511540	3518620	The spaceship looked like a large acorn, runs about 14 feet to the top and about 10
3518620	3526420	to 12 feet wide at the bottom with a collar on it that has writing on the collar.
3526420	3531940	And it had a triangle on it, and it looked like the triangle was put on there with a
3531940	3538940	welder by sticking the welder against the metal to shape the writing, and the writing
3538940	3542140	was all the way around the bell shape of it.
3542140	3548900	And the black, the bottom of the bell shape was completely black.
3548900	3555300	And around the top of the edges was smoke covered, and the space thing looked like it
3555300	3557620	was copper or bronze.
3557620	3561020	Stringfield contacted Myron's cousin on October 3, 1990.
3561020	3565980	J.S., as he'll be referred to, was reluctant to get involved due to family reasons.
3565980	3570860	He did confirm delivering glazed bricks to right pat with Myron, remembered guards wearing
3570860	3574300	protective clothing and a technician with a blow torch.
3574300	3578660	When Stringfield asked J.S. if he had seen the craft in the building, J.S. stated, quote,
3578660	3581260	I don't remember many details on that trip.
3581260	3585100	My partner probably knows more because he was more inquisitive.
3585100	3591020	Fast forward to 1991, Myron told Stringfield J.S. was willing to finally discuss his observations
3591020	3594540	that fateful December day in 1965.
3594540	3599820	On March 30 to April 1, 1991, Stringfield again interviewed J.S.
3599820	3602680	J.S. told Stringfield a new story.
3602680	3605860	He did in fact see the object the day before.
3605860	3607740	He and Myron went to right pat.
3607740	3612380	He had made the trip solo with an initial delivery of bricks and clearly recalled an
3612380	3618220	object shaped like the Liberty Bell sitting upright under a tarp aboard a low-boy trailer.
3618220	3623700	J.S. estimated the craft to be 8 to 10 feet tall and 8 to 10 feet wide, quote, I didn't
3623700	3628820	ask any questions, but it probably arrived a short time before I did, end quote.
3628820	3631460	J.S. discussed activity in the area.
3631460	3635900	Men wearing fatigued suits and there were armed guards, but he didn't see anyone carrying
3635900	3638380	any sort of rifle or machine gun.
3638380	3642980	Unlike the next day's trip, quote, there was nothing unusual at the entrance gate.
3642980	3647580	I gave the guard my identification and showed him my bill of landing and was directed to
3647580	3656140	the area for unloading near the big red brick building, end quote.
3656140	3661460	Like most cases, the discussion of bodies is the most controversial aspect of Kecksburg.
3661460	3666180	In his appearance in the 2003 annual crash retrieval conference proceedings, Stan Gordon
3666180	3669460	discussed the subject of bodies present at the crash.
3669460	3674500	To quote Stan, in more recent years I have heard rumors that are not widely known that
3674500	3679740	two small bodies were supposedly found at the impact location in 1965.
3679740	3684100	I have generally accepted this as hearsay since there has never been any evidence to
3684100	3685980	back up these claims.
3685980	3690540	One such testimony actually came from Myron, the trucker we just discussed, who spoke to
3690540	3693980	Gordon offering new details in 1998.
3693980	3697940	In poor health, Myron agreed to meet with Gordon for a documentary Gordon was working
3697940	3700820	on titled Kecksburg, the Untold Story.
3700820	3706220	Stan says the two were discussing what Myron saw in 1965, Myron suddenly mentioned something
3706220	3711620	which caused Stan and the video production crew to look at the man with astonishment.
3711620	3715700	Myron added to his previous testimony delivered to Gordon and Stringfield, stating when he
3715700	3720100	peeked inside the warehouse he observed the bell propped up by scaffolding, but he also
3720100	3724060	saw a body lying on a workbench in the same room.
3724060	3729180	Myron added this body was covered in a white sheet, measuring four to five feet tall.
3729180	3733620	The only feature seen was lizard-like skin from a left hand sticking out from under
3733620	3734620	the cover.
3734620	3738540	I walked in the building and seen the bell shape there and they was working on it.
3738540	3743260	I also seen an object laying on the workbench over there and the workbench runs about ten
3743260	3749660	to twelve feet long and about thirty-two inches wide and about three foot, about thirty-six
3749660	3751300	inches off the floor.
3751300	3757060	I seen the left hand of every what was in there sticking out underneath of the sterile
3757060	3764380	white pad and he only had three fingers, it was about four foot nine or four foot five
3764380	3772580	inches tall if it was standing up, but it looked like it weighed about eighty pounds
3772580	3779020	and it had dark green or brownish skin and it was just like a lizard.
3779020	3785340	I have no doubt in my mind that the body laid on that table and the left hand of him was
3785340	3792540	sticking out underneath of the white sterile pad that they had placed over him and he had
3792540	3798340	the three index finger and his skin looked like lizard.
3798340	3805820	I asked Myron why he waited so many years to divulge what he had seen in 1965.
3805820	3811300	Well for the reason I never said anything before because Uncle Sam said if it were to
3811300	3815860	ever leased out and they had to come and lock you up and throw the keys away or give you
3815860	3819780	a bullet to satisfy you, no one will ever talk about it.
3819780	3825980	Right now is the time to tell it before something drastic happens and my son, he is twenty-four
3825980	3831980	years old and he said why are you going to do it now and I said well I may not live till
3831980	3836380	tomorrow the next day to tell it so I'll tell it all tonight and be done with it.
3836380	3843300	The only thing I've got now is a bad heart and high blood pressure and sugar and on oxygen
3843300	3849860	once in a while and walking around taking nitroglycerin and all there is now I'm telling
3849860	3852820	you now because I may not be here tomorrow.
3852820	3858420	Why add this onto his story after nearly a decade after his initial testimony?
3858420	3863020	Another witness Joel contacted Stan after hearing local news covering Leslie Keane and
3863020	3866780	the CFI's attempts to pry free Kecksburg documentation.
3866780	3871820	Gordon would meet with Joel at his home in late 2002, seeing Joel go back and forth on
3871820	3875640	whether or not to proceed with the interview in fear of getting in trouble for what he
3875640	3876640	saw.
3876640	3880580	Joel claimed on the day of the Kecksburg crash he entered the woods to investigate the crash
3880580	3881580	film.
3881580	3886980	His attention was drawn to a metal object emanating bright clashes of colors like electricity.
3886980	3891700	Joel hid in the woods to observe army and air force personnel, men in civilian clothing
3891700	3894900	and men in suits and hats enter the crash area.
3894900	3899260	Joel claimed to have observed an army general hop on top of the metallic object with a probe
3899260	3902140	in his hand similar to an officer's billy club.
3902140	3905740	The general smacked the object and the tool flew out of his hands.
3905740	3910940	Gordon noted at this time Joel's expression changed to a far more somber and uncomfortable
3910940	3911940	tone.
3911940	3915980	Joel stated soon after striking the object a hatch opened that swung from right to left
3915980	3920340	at the front of the object, accompanied by a whirling hissing sound.
3920340	3925460	Joel described a scene what looked like quote two fingers in an unusually long arm and quote
3925460	3928340	inside the hatch before it closed again.
3928340	3932500	The concept of bodies may be supported by the testimony of Bill Weaver I mentioned earlier
3932500	3933500	in the video.
3933500	3938460	Weaver, a teenager, observed men exit a large light colored box truck in what he described
3938460	3939940	as moonsuits.
3939940	3945140	The men carried a box shaped device measuring four to five feet square resting upon a stretcher
3945140	3946460	with four handles.
3946460	3952340	A little while later there was a large truck pulled in, a light colored truck, a box van
3952340	3953340	type.
3953340	3955460	Out of it there was four guys come out.
3955460	3957820	They had what we call moonsuits at the time.
3957820	3961820	They were white cover all type suits.
3961820	3968380	They took a box out of there, a box maybe four or five foot square.
3968380	3974100	They carried down four handles and they carried that down to the object.
3974100	3977660	About just right after that there was a military man.
3977660	3983300	He came over to the car and he told us to leave and I got into an argument with him.
3983300	3987460	I told him I didn't, you know, I wanted to stay, I didn't want to leave.
3987460	3992060	He told me that he would confiscate my car if I didn't.
3992060	3993060	What's going on everybody?
3993060	3994060	It's UAP Gerb.
3994060	4000580	Thank you so much for joining me today as we took a deep dive into the 1965 Kexburg, Pennsylvania
4000580	4002060	UFO crash.
4002060	4006540	Now, what would you say if I told you today we just started to scratch the surface of
4006540	4007540	this case?
4007540	4012340	Like I mentioned earlier in the witnesses tab, there are so many witnesses who have more
4012340	4014260	to add to this story.
4014260	4019900	The reason I covered Bulabush, Romansky, Betters, Weaver and so forth is because I think their
4019900	4024940	testimonies offer the most complete picture and insight into the Kexburg story.
4024940	4029860	There are other residents who talk about a military base being set up in a home near
4029860	4033980	them, kind of like Romansky discussed in his interview on Montel Williams.
4033980	4037620	There's other witnesses who talk more about the military presence and how it might have
4037620	4041580	been obfuscated from a certain point of view when the military had reached up on Meteor
4041580	4043260	Road and so forth.
4043260	4046700	So there is just so much rich testimony to pursue.
4046700	4052140	The Kexburg case has also seen so much coverage as we saw with Kexburg, the new Roswell, and
4052140	4057620	Kexburg the Untold Story and Kexburg the Unsolved Mysteries episode in Stan Gordon's
4057620	4059380	1993 documentary.
4059380	4062020	There has been so much coverage on this case.
4062020	4068580	That is why I tried to take a more focused approach on breaking down the crash, focusing
4068580	4073460	on a select few witnesses, focusing on the overall story, and kind of narrowing in on
4073460	4079020	what happened to the craft, the bell, after the case, as well as focusing on Eric Walker
4079020	4081140	and Lyndon B. Johnson.
4081140	4085140	Now those of you familiar with the case will know there are a couple things I didn't discuss
4085140	4086140	here.
4086140	4091180	One of these was D. Glock, the alleged Nazi wonder weapon that was shaped the exact same
4091180	4096060	shape as the Kexburg bell, a similar shape to the Liberty bell, and that is because I
4096060	4100820	would like to cover that and cover sort of Nick Cook's work in the hunt for zero point
4100820	4104140	and the Nazi connection to UAP in a whole nother video.
4104140	4110100	I also left out claims of Kexburg and affirmation of Kexburg from the witness Clifford Stone
4110100	4114380	who testified in the 2001 NPC conference under Stephen Greer.
4114380	4118340	I did this because of course Clifford Stone carries with him a little bit of controversy
4118340	4124740	so I want to analyze his claims and his merits before I put them into a Kexburg case in their
4124740	4126140	own video.
4126140	4129580	Now what were your favorite parts of this investigation?
4129580	4134380	For me, I must say I just I adore Jim Romansky.
4134380	4138500	I think he's an incredible witness, probably my favorite eyewitness of any case, the way
4138500	4142860	in which he passionately talks about the case and any interview he has, especially Montell
4142860	4143860	Williams.
4143860	4149020	I really appreciate his demeanor, I think he offers valuable insights into this case and
4149020	4153700	especially the Montell Williams show where he discusses kind of how his children faced
4153700	4157740	issues with his experience at Kexburg.
4157740	4162300	Also I hope everybody enjoyed kind of the oblique look into the blue berets.
4162300	4165260	I think that's one of the most crucial aspects of this investigation.
4165260	4169100	They need to be investigated much more and I will continue to do so over the course of
4169100	4170700	my videos.
4170700	4174900	Investigate there the incident Fort McGuire Dix as Leonard Stringfield supposed blue
4174900	4177140	beret insider has claimed.
4177140	4182180	Try to kind of focus in on the security police and Air Force police aspect of the blue berets
4182380	4187580	and see if these guys might be used as a rapid reaction unit for kind of domestic or even
4187580	4189980	foreign crash retrieval efforts.
4189980	4193260	Also of course I've talked about it in many videos and he's a person I view a sort of
4193260	4198060	a linchpin to the whole UAP phenomena, Dr. Eric A Walker.
4198060	4202740	Of course in this video we saw, we talked about this in the Sarbakar video but we ran
4202740	4208860	over his claims about saying he was in fact the Kexburg case and that he did know about
4208940	4215940	Majestic 12 and Robert Sarbakar was correct in terms of Dr. Eric A Walker being a crucial
4215940	4218380	member in UFO crash retrieval.
4218380	4223300	But what was new to me here was the UARC the university affiliated research center in the
4223300	4225860	ARL at Penn State University.
4225860	4229420	I think there's some great connections there to explore and I will continue to do so as
4229420	4230420	well.
4230420	4235340	Also I found the Lyndon B Johnson connections with Dr. Eric Walker as well as Johnson's
4235340	4238420	meeting scheduled the day after Kexburg fascinating.
4238420	4243220	Now if you look in the show notes and you can also find these PDFs posted in my discord
4243220	4246900	if you don't want to go to the link of Grant Cameron's files but you will see all of the
4246900	4250260	files I reference because I really recommend following along.
4250260	4255140	I just gave a brief sample of some of the content we went over in this video but there's
4255140	4258860	pages and pages and pages of Grant Cameron covering this case.
4258860	4263500	I also really recommend reading crash retrievals one through seven string fields work and seeing
4263500	4267020	how he approached the Kexburg case over a span of ten years.
4267020	4272740	It's really fascinating to see him kind of reference uncle the alleged insider he talked
4272740	4278540	to a through a media intermediary with and just him a interview Pete who is now of course
4278540	4283980	James Jim Romansky interview Myron and so forth speaking of Myron I find this witness
4283980	4286580	so interesting.
4286580	4291700	Initially I found it to be quite a red flag that Myron initially approached Stan Gordon
4291700	4299940	in the late 80s and also spoke to Leonard Stringfield and it wasn't until 1992 1993
4299940	4304340	for Stan Gordon's newest documentary that Myron touched on the topic of bodies when
4304340	4309820	he had only commented on what a personnel at the base had said to him before about it
4309820	4312780	being a hot issue for autopsies.
4312780	4316940	I think this case is a little different than something like the 1955 Del Rio case with
4316940	4322540	Robert Willingham as Robert Willingham initially stated he saw no such bodies and then changed
4322540	4327740	his tone in about the Jeff Rents episode maybe in 2008 2012 I want to say around the time
4327740	4332660	of the the book by Noah Torres came out.
4332660	4336740	Watching Myron was very interesting because that was a late pop up in my research seen
4336740	4340860	his interview in the 1993 Stan Gordon documentary.
4340860	4346300	He of course as he claimed felt much fear and that's why he kind of omitted the topic
4346300	4353060	of bodies before now there are a couple other witnesses who claim or are adjacent to body
4353060	4357860	claims here such as Don Sebastian I didn't cover him just because I didn't see how his
4357860	4363740	story really really gelled with other witnesses because he described when he approached the
4363740	4368220	scene and saw military men and was kind of hiding around observing the military operations
4368220	4374460	he heard a loud scream from the forest no other individual in the present area has also admitted
4374460	4380100	hearing this scream so I left that out what did you guys think of the Kecksburg case I
4380100	4383980	want to know everybody's thoughts this of course is such a famous case of course I
4383980	4388420	think it's pretty self-evident this crash case has something very tangible something
4388420	4392620	that actually crashed in the woods in Kecksburg and this was not a meteor as Blue Book claimed
4392620	4397980	I think the the discussion of the chaff discovered alongside the meteor where the Blue Book team
4397980	4404060	from the 660 second radar squadron is extremely interesting I also am unsure about the claims
4404140	4409660	of Soviet capsule or American capsule I think there's plenty of evidence and discussion to
4409660	4417020	dispute the landing of a human-made space object I was really excited to relay this bell shape to
4417020	4423340	the infographics whistleblower and that reddit whistleblower post all too often in crash cases
4423340	4428780	we mainly hear about saucers or egg shapes so it's really cool to focus some attention on this
4428780	4436300	kind of almost a liberty bell shaped craft with strange hieroglyphs hieroglyphic writings on it
4436300	4442220	I think it's it's such a unique type of craft especially as described by many of the witnesses
4442220	4448060	just big enough to fit an individual maybe two the off-white the off-yellow bronze-ish color
4448620	4454140	and the fact this alongside other craft descriptions seems like it was made out of a single piece of
4454140	4460220	metal like pouring liquid metal into a cast I love this case right now I lean towards this
4460220	4465340	being a legitimate UAP retrieval case I think there's a lot of evidence here a lot more evidence
4465340	4470220	that needs to be pursued of course the only thing missing from this case with all of the
4470220	4476700	witness testimony with Johnson with Walker with with with all the witnesses after the fact is some
4476700	4481420	official documents and those of course are very scant in this case because apparently NASA lost
4481420	4487500	them in 1987 but again let me know what you guys think I want to appreciate every single person
4487500	4491740	here watching this video thank you so much for giving me your time I can't believe you guys will

4517020	4523340	on the channel too I know right now that interviews I've had usually take three weeks or so to conjure
4523340	4528140	up because there's so much editing involved I do want to do some pure interviews as well but of
4528140	4532940	course I'll be in the lab working on my my interview skills because I can get very tripped up with my
4532940	4537340	words as you all know but thank you so much for watching guys I will catch everybody on the next
