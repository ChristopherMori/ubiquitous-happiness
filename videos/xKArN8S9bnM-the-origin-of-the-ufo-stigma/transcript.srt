1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I've been studying UFOs. I've been studying UFOs. Did you know there are UFOs out here flying around? Unidentified UFOs.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This would be the place for them, Southern California.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It could be aliens, it could be balloons, or it could be alien balloons.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
President Obama says that there is footage and records of objects in the skies.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He's asked these unidentified aerial phenomenon and he says we don't know exactly what they are.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What do you think that it is?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I would ask him again. Thank you.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The reality of the unidentified aerial or submerged phenomena is not up for debate.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It is fact there are anomalous signatures that operate in our skies, oceans, and near-Earth orbit

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that exhibit strange and astounding characteristics including instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic velocity, anti-gravity, low observability, and transmedial travel.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Whether you recognize the phenomena as non-human in origin, or believe that these signatures are advanced hidden human technology,

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
or any combination of these is up to you in all of these warrant future investigation.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But no matter what you believe, you cannot deny the UFO study is looked at with ridicule, disdain, laughter, and has historically been treated as a joke.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But where did this UFO stigma come from and why is studying anomalous signatures on this planet looked at as silly?

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Why have civilian and military pilots historically been advised not to share UFO sightings,

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
fearing revocation of their flight status?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why is serious scientific investigation into UFOs laughed at as seen as a fruitless venture?

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
There are three things about this whole thing, Tom, that no one can deny.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There are incontrovertible points, even the grossest skeptic can't deny.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The first of all is that the UFO reports not only exist but persist.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
When I started with the Air Force, I thought that this was a fad and a few years would just disappear.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And it's global, we have reports now from 140 countries, practically as many countries as there are in the United Nations,

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and the most important of these three things is that many, unfortunately not all,

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
but many of the reports come from highly, highly credible, technically trained people, you see.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I am UAP Curb, guys, and today I wanted to do a review on the history of the UFO stigma

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and highlight how this narrative of UFO being nothing more than misidentified prosaic phenomena

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and only studied by tin foil conspiracies and whack jobs,

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
has in fact been pushed and perpetrated by our own United States government.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We could realistically start with the 1946 Kenneth Arnold saucer sightings or the Roswell crash of 1947,

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but you know me, let's start where our paper trail leads us.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So let's take a peek at the first official USG program, Investigating UFOs.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Project Sign began in 1948 and ran until 1949.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
United States Air Force General Nathan Twinning established this project,

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
initially naming Sign Project Saucer due to Lieutenant General Twinning's assertion that flying discs are, quote,

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
real and not visionary or fictitious, as seen in this letter to AAF commanding General George Shlugen.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The written sign report states that some UFO reports present actual objects, but origins are undeterminable.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Edward J. Ruppelt, future director of Project Blue Book and Grudge,

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
claimed Sign endorsed the interplanetary explanation for some of the unexplained signed sightings.

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If you know UAP Gerb, you know any official United States government UFO investigation can be traced to the DOE or parents,

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the AEC, the Atomic Energy Commission.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Well, get this, all sign reports were required to be sent to the Army and Navy Research and Development Board,

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
the USAF Scientific Advisory Group and the Atomic Energy Commission.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The program was shut down in 1949 by General Hoyt Vandenberg for, quote, lack of proof,

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
but the next official investigation into UFOs was commissioned the exact same year.

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Project Grudge ran throughout 1949 when it was officially terminated,

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
but Grudge records were updated up until 1999, featuring a full published report in 1960.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Reviewing the Grudge report is not the topic of this video, but seen as it is 707 pages of case analysis,

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
maybe I'll do a most interesting cases on Grudge reports video someday.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Anyways, USAF formed this program specifically intending to alleviate public anxiety over UFOs.

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Here we can see the first real breadcrumbs of the USG trying to alter public perception of UFOs.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Grudge was tasked to explain sightings away as balloons, conventional aircraft, optical illusions, planets, mass hallucinations, etc.,

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
such as in the case of the Lubbock lights, where four engineering slash STEM professors in Lubbock, Texas,

53
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
witnessed multiple flights of 20 to 30 lights traveling at incredible speeds in a perfect semi-circle formation.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Grudge infers and marks this case down to a flock of migrating birds,

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
even though this explanation is unsubstantiated and not shared by the professor witnesses.

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
J. Allen Heineck, the future Blue Book scientific advisor, stated that Project Grudge was, quote,

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
less science and more of a public relations campaign.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
In my association with Project Blue Book, I know very well that it was not a scientific project.

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I also know that they never, never would notify the media when an interesting case came up.

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They did everything they could to keep it down, so they definitely withheld information.

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You know, when I first interviewed Allen years ago, there was a theory going around that anybody who saw a flying saucer

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
was probably be followed by swamp gas somewhere in Louisiana and didn't know what he or she was seeing.

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We've had a lot of documentation since that time.

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I think one of the main things that has come out here that Peter has done

65
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
is to substantiate the credibility of many of the civilians.

66
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now, Project Blue Book ran from 1952 to 1969 and is where the true UFO stigma was born.

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Blue Book, of course, is the most well-known USG official UFO study

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and was founded to determine if UFOs were in fact a threat to national security

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and to scientifically analyze UFO data.

70
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Fun fact, from 1952 to 1969, Blue Book analyzed 12,618 UFO reports,

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
701 of which were classified as unexplained after extensive analysis.

72
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I've talked at length before about how J. Allen Heineck stated Blue Book was essentially a disinformation project

73
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and a distraction tool used to cover up and gloss over the UFO issue.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We won't tread on Heineck too much, but who was Heineck?

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Astrophysicist Dr. J. Allen Heineck served as the public advisor and scientific advisor to Project Blue Book

76
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and lives in infamy for self-admittedly participating in the UFO cover-up.

77
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
During the tenure of Project Blue Book, Heineck's dissatisfaction for the ridicule

78
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and planned debunking of credible UFO reports was a, quote, open secret,

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
but the doctors spoke openly about this after leaving Blue Book.

80
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you think back to the classic misexplanations of swamp gas and weather balloons,

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Heineck was one of the key individuals who pushed to deliver these hypotheses on a national stage.

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But how did Project Blue Book do this and how did they warp the entire American public perception on UFOs?

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:29,000
In December of 1952, one of the most famous mass UFO sightings in American history occurred over Washington, D.C., our nation's capital.

84
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Over a series of nights, a group of lights accompanied with radar signatures appeared over Washington, D.C.

85
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Many reported physical craft were seen, including the pilots of a B-52 bomber,

86
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and at the time serious consideration was put towards this case being the craft of E.T. Origin.

87
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This event often referred to as the Invasion of Washington,

88
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
where the Washington National Airport sightings took the nation by storm,

89
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
leading to 148 national newspapers covering the event in the following six-month period.

90
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What followed captivated our country even more?

91
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
On July of 1952, USAF Major General John Sanford, USAF Director of Intelligence,

92
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and USAF Director of Operations Roger M. Ramey,

93
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
yes, the same General Ramey that ordered Jesse Marcell to pose with fake wreckage to curb the Roswell crash,

94
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
held a press conference at the Pentagon.

95
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
During the conference, Sanford explains the way the bulk of UFO reports,

96
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
quote, to their own satisfaction as hoaxes,

97
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
erroneously identified friendly aircraft as meteorological or electric phenomena, or as light aberration.

98
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
However, he goes on to quote,

99
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There have been a certain percentage of this volume of reports that have been made by credible observers of relatively incredible things.

100
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Sanford then referenced the DC incident by saying that in no way were the sightings related to any secret development by any department of the United States.

101
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But in 1953, the USG and CIA walked back and flipped Sanford's statements on their head

102
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
by forming the Robertson Panel.

103
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Under the guise of mass panic and to alter public reaction to UFOs as stated by Dr. Heineck himself,

104
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:26,000
physicist and CIA consultant Howard P. Robertson was directed to review all Air Force case files on UFOs from Project Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book.

105
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, and by the way, at this same time behind the scenes,

106
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
the Tell Memorial Institute, who has a storied connection to UFO, especially material analysis around the 50s,

107
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
was commissioned to separately review all Air Force case files.

108
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Anyways, the panel met for a series of four formal meetings and conducted such riveting analysis as

109
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
reviewing 23 of 2,331 provided USAF UFO cases on record,

110
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
watching two films of UFOs and comparing them to seagulls,

111
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
discussing the problems inherent to monitoring UFO sightings,

112
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and finally meeting with USAF Major Dewey J. Fornette.

113
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Fornette spoke to the panel that for a year he had coordinated UFO affairs for the Pentagon and supported the extraterrestrial hypothesis for some unexplained cases.

114
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The panel spent the rest of that fourth day discussing that meeting.

115
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The Robertson panel concluded that all national security agencies should strip UFOs of, quote, special status,

116
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and suggest to the public that there is no legitimate evidence of their existence.

117
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,000
However, signatory to the report Thornton L. Page admits on the 3rd of October in 1993 that the chairman told members ahead of the meeting

118
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
to debunk all UFO reports presented to them, and to, quote, reduce public concern.

119
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And what's also really important to note is that the Robertson panel was held a month after USAF Colonel Donald L. Bauer

120
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,000
forbade Captain Edward J. Ruppelt from visiting the CIA Office of Special Investigations to share information on compelling UFO data.

121
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So what we can derive here is the Robertson's panel's conclusions were predetermined in order to devalue UFOs

122
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and attribute them to nonsense and misidentified prosaic phenomena.

123
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
In fact, Dr. Heineck quotes that the panel was handed down the unwritten law of the Air Force.

124
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't rock the boat, play it cool, and don't get the public excited.

125
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What is awfully curious here is that after UFOs had been publicly denounced, the subsequent year, 1953, USAF issues Regulation 200-2.

126
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
This piece restricts UFO reporting procedures and supersedes the former AFL 200-5.

127
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
This means all confirmed UFO reports were to be sent to the Air Force Intelligence and not Blue Book.

128
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This included reports by USAF personnel, and this keeps credible sightings from both Congress and the American people.

129
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,000
On the 5th of April 1966, Congress held its first closed session on UFOs in a hearing by the House Armed Services Committee.

130
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Former President and at the time Congressman Gerald Ford noted the ridicule he received for arranging the hearings,

131
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,000
quote, as I expected some persons have ridiculed my call for a congressional investigation into unidentified flying objects.

132
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Part of Ford's reasoning for calling for the hearings was dissatisfaction in Heineck's explanations of UFOs as swamp gas or weather balloons,

133
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
particularly the 1966 Dexter, Michigan mass UFO citing Heineck devalued as swamp gas.

134
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:59,000
On the panels had Blue Book head from 63 to 69, USAF Major Hector Quintanilla, J. Allen Heineck, and Secretary of the Air Force Harold D. Brown.

135
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
On this panel, Quintanilla tells the House Armed Services Committee that Project Blue Book had, quote,

136
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:15,000
no radar cases that are unexplained, explaining the vast majority of radar detections away as temperature inversions or just misidentified phenomena.

137
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This was an irrefutable lie seen as Blue Book reports show numerous radar unknowns alongside corroborating witness testimony.

138
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This lie was later pointed out by Dr. Heineck himself who pointed out several anomalous radar detections that stumped Blue Book including 1951 Goose Bay, 1956,

139
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Lake and Heath, and 1957 Shrevaport.

140
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Due to his dissatisfaction as being used as a, quote, puppet of the Air Force, who, quote,

141
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:55,000
only says what the Air Force wants me to say, Heineck prepared a surprise statement for the hearings requesting the USAF commission a civilian panel of physical and social scientists

142
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:05,000
to examine the UFO problem critically for the express purpose of determining whether a major problem exists.

143
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Both Heineck and physicist James E. McDonald requested but were denied a seat on this panel.

144
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Instead, in the summer of 1966 physicist Edward Condon of the University of Colorado Boulder, my rival university, so I don't like them, was selected.

145
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Condon was well known amongst the scientific community for his tenacious work on the House Un-American Activities Committee and a suitable candidate for the job.

146
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And I'm sure the modest sum of $313,000 for a year's work didn't hurt.

147
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Condon received multiple requests to brief the committee by retired USMC Major Donald Keyhoe, ARPO, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization,

148
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
NICAP, McDonald, and Heineck, all of whom agreed to share any and all research files on UFOs.

149
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Condon declined many of these offers. The committee moved very slowly, hampered by the apparent lack of funds and methodology.

150
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Lacking subject matter expertise, and strangely enough, committee members usually worked without coordination with one another.

151
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In late 1967, Condon stated in a public lecture he thought the government should not study UFOs because the subject matter was nonsense,

152
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
adding, quote, but I'm not supposed to reach that conclusion for another year.

153
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This is a very strange statement seen as, in this time, Condon has been contracted to investigate UFOs, not have a conclusion.

154
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:49,000
In 1967, the aforementioned James E. McDonald made public a 1966 memo written by the Condon Committee's second-in-command, Robert J. Lowe,

155
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
who wrote to two University of Colorado admins that they could expect the study to demonstrate that UFO observations had no basis in reality.

156
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Conclusions before findings. This trick memo was written by Lowe, who was a hardened skeptic heading into the committee,

157
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and the paper trail does in fact exist that he served in the CIA before teaching at CU Boulder.

158
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Quote, the trick would be, I think, to describe the project so that, to the public, it would appear a totally objective study,

159
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:30,000
but to the scientific community would present the image of a group of non-believers trying their best to be objective but having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer.

160
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
One way to do this would be to stress investigation, not the physical phenomena,

161
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
but rather of the people who do the observing, the psychology and sociology of persons and groups who report seen UFOs.

162
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If the emphasis were put here, rather than on examination of the old question of the physical reality of the saucer,

163
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I think the scientific community would quickly get the message.

164
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
This trick, by the alleged CIA asset and second in command to the Condon Committee, Robert Lowe,

165
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
perfectly details the UFO stigma and how it would operate moving forward.

166
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Forget the citing, no matter how credible, question the psychology of the observer.

167
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The final nails in the coffin of serious UFO study would be hammered in by the release of the Condon Report

168
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and subsequent Condon Report review by the National Academy of Sciences.

169
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The Condon Report released as a book, both hardcover and soft, to be consumed by the public.

170
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
In his conclusions and recommendations, Condon stated, quote,

171
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Our general conclusion is that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge.

172
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Careful consideration of the record, as it is available to us, leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs

173
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby.

174
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He recommends that the Air Force and USG at large shut down and prohibit any investigation into UFOs.

175
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The report seemingly does away with the scientific method to explain all cases away as conventional or natural explanations.

176
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
James E. McDonald calls the report inadequate and said, quote,

177
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It represents an examination of only a tiny fraction of the most puzzling UFO reports of the past two decades

178
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and that its level of scientific argument is wholly unsatisfactory.

179
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Both McDonald and Heineck publicly stated that the committee ignored key evidence

180
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and could not explain 25 to 30% of the cases examined.

181
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Because the Condon committee was unable to explain one quarter of the cases that were submitted that they studied.

182
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm curious, and I think everyone is now thinking the obvious question.

183
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
How did they handle that in their report, the ones they couldn't explain?

184
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Well, very nicely and very adroitly, I use the word.

185
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Dr. Condon wrote this summary and completely neglected the contents of the report.

186
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The report received almost universal praise from the news media,

187
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,000
with many magazines, journals and newspapers publishing approving reviews or positive editorials of the Condon report.

188
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Some of these compared any continued belief in UFOs to those who believe the earth is flat

189
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
or believe in ghosts and Bigfoot or other supernatural or unsubstantiated phenomena.

190
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Others predicted that the interest in UFOs would die in a few generations

191
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and only be dimly remembered as a candle flick in the darkness.

192
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Science, the official publication of the American Association for Advancement of Science said,

193
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:53,000
quote, the Colorado study is unquestionably the most thorough and sophisticated investigation of the nebulous UFO phenomena ever conducted.

194
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
In 1969, the National Academy of Sciences wrote a review of the committee,

195
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
citing Condon's work as sound, approving of his methodology,

196
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and agreeing in his assertions that there should be no more formal investigation into UFO.

197
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
In 1970, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics

198
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
made official statements agreeing with Condon's suggestion

199
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Little of value had been uncovered by scientific UFO studies.

200
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,000
UFOs were now lumped in the same boat as ghosts, Bigfoot and other fringe topics or conspiracy,

201
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
a subject to be scoffed and laughed at instead of disgust and studied.

202
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
UFO was now synonymous with tinfoil hat conspiracists instead of the accredited physicists

203
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
like Heineck and McDonald who wished for nothing more than to study UFO.

204
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Sine, Grudge, Blue Book, the Robertson Panel and the Condon Committee

205
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
were all guised as serious investigation into UFOs,

206
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
truly used to publicly discredit the phenomena while real research went on behind the scenes.

207
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
All of these tools culminated in 1969 so the USG could say, quote,

208
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
UFOs do not exist and we do not study them.

209
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
However, of course we know that this is not true

210
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and this stigma was created for the purposeful distraction to take eyes off the UFO study.

211
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
There are times in your life where you have been worried to speak to a certain person

212
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
or people's about UFO or judge somebody because they've brought up UFO

213
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
or thought, maybe I shouldn't talk about this.

214
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's no secret the UFO phenomena has a massive stigma around it associated with conspiracy,

215
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
with whack jobs, with ghosts and Bigfoot.

216
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And as we've seen in this video, that's very real and very planned.

217
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The sophisticated disinformation campaigns Grudge talks about here is those in effect.

218
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Project Sine, Project Grudge, Blue Book, the Robertson Panel, the Condon Committee,

219
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,000
all of these have been used as tools to ridicule the study of anomalous things in our skies.

220
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's absurd, absolutely absurd, all under the guise of scientific research.

221
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I hope you learned something today.

222
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I certainly did.

223
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Making this video, there was a ton of research to go into it.

224
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I got to read the whole Grudge and Blue Book reports,

225
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
a ton of interesting cases I want to cover.

226
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But I will put every case I can in the video description.

227
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Many of them I have are PDFs.

228
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So if you'd like to get them all yourself, please email me at uapgerb.com or join my Discord in the description.

229
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I will actually have a channel for all of the case files.

230
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But did I miss anything in this video?

231
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Or anything else I should have covered?

232
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
How did you beat the UFO stigma in your personal life?

233
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
How did you overcome this woo and begin talking about it freely?

234
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I know that I overcame this stigma from very early on when I pieced together that hey,

235
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
UFOs are being studied by the United States government both publicly and in the shadows.

236
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So why are they being shamed?

237
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's fascinating and unfortunately this stigma has been wildly successful.

238
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So thank you guys, I appreciate you joining me.

239
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Please remember to like and subscribe.

240
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I will catch everybody on the next UAP Gerb Show.

241
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Bye.
