0	7000	I've been studying UFOs. I've been studying UFOs. Did you know there are UFOs out here flying around? Unidentified UFOs.
10000	12000	This would be the place for them, Southern California.
12000	18000	It could be aliens, it could be balloons, or it could be alien balloons.
19000	27000	President Obama says that there is footage and records of objects in the skies.
27000	34000	He's asked these unidentified aerial phenomenon and he says we don't know exactly what they are.
34000	36000	What do you think that it is?
36000	39000	I would ask him again. Thank you.
39000	45000	The reality of the unidentified aerial or submerged phenomena is not up for debate.
45000	52000	It is fact there are anomalous signatures that operate in our skies, oceans, and near-Earth orbit
52000	66000	that exhibit strange and astounding characteristics including instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic velocity, anti-gravity, low observability, and transmedial travel.
66000	74000	Whether you recognize the phenomena as non-human in origin, or believe that these signatures are advanced hidden human technology,
74000	79000	or any combination of these is up to you in all of these warrant future investigation.
79000	89000	But no matter what you believe, you cannot deny the UFO study is looked at with ridicule, disdain, laughter, and has historically been treated as a joke.
89000	97000	But where did this UFO stigma come from and why is studying anomalous signatures on this planet looked at as silly?
97000	103000	Why have civilian and military pilots historically been advised not to share UFO sightings,
103000	106000	fearing revocation of their flight status?
106000	112000	Why is serious scientific investigation into UFOs laughed at as seen as a fruitless venture?
112000	117000	There are three things about this whole thing, Tom, that no one can deny.
117000	121000	There are incontrovertible points, even the grossest skeptic can't deny.
121000	125000	The first of all is that the UFO reports not only exist but persist.
125000	129000	When I started with the Air Force, I thought that this was a fad and a few years would just disappear.
129000	137000	And it's global, we have reports now from 140 countries, practically as many countries as there are in the United Nations,
137000	142000	and the most important of these three things is that many, unfortunately not all,
142000	148000	but many of the reports come from highly, highly credible, technically trained people, you see.
148000	154000	I am UAP Curb, guys, and today I wanted to do a review on the history of the UFO stigma
154000	160000	and highlight how this narrative of UFO being nothing more than misidentified prosaic phenomena
160000	164000	and only studied by tin foil conspiracies and whack jobs,
164000	170000	has in fact been pushed and perpetrated by our own United States government.
174000	182000	We could realistically start with the 1946 Kenneth Arnold saucer sightings or the Roswell crash of 1947,
182000	186000	but you know me, let's start where our paper trail leads us.
186000	193000	So let's take a peek at the first official USG program, Investigating UFOs.
193000	198000	Project Sign began in 1948 and ran until 1949.
198000	202000	United States Air Force General Nathan Twinning established this project,
202000	209000	initially naming Sign Project Saucer due to Lieutenant General Twinning's assertion that flying discs are, quote,
209000	216000	real and not visionary or fictitious, as seen in this letter to AAF commanding General George Shlugen.
216000	224000	The written sign report states that some UFO reports present actual objects, but origins are undeterminable.
224000	228000	Edward J. Ruppelt, future director of Project Blue Book and Grudge,
228000	234000	claimed Sign endorsed the interplanetary explanation for some of the unexplained signed sightings.
234000	242000	If you know UAP Gerb, you know any official United States government UFO investigation can be traced to the DOE or parents,
242000	244000	the AEC, the Atomic Energy Commission.
244000	251000	Well, get this, all sign reports were required to be sent to the Army and Navy Research and Development Board,
251000	257000	the USAF Scientific Advisory Group and the Atomic Energy Commission.
257000	264000	The program was shut down in 1949 by General Hoyt Vandenberg for, quote, lack of proof,
264000	272000	but the next official investigation into UFOs was commissioned the exact same year.
272000	278000	Project Grudge ran throughout 1949 when it was officially terminated,
278000	286000	but Grudge records were updated up until 1999, featuring a full published report in 1960.
286000	293000	Reviewing the Grudge report is not the topic of this video, but seen as it is 707 pages of case analysis,
293000	298000	maybe I'll do a most interesting cases on Grudge reports video someday.
298000	307000	Anyways, USAF formed this program specifically intending to alleviate public anxiety over UFOs.
307000	314000	Here we can see the first real breadcrumbs of the USG trying to alter public perception of UFOs.
314000	323000	Grudge was tasked to explain sightings away as balloons, conventional aircraft, optical illusions, planets, mass hallucinations, etc.,
323000	329000	such as in the case of the Lubbock lights, where four engineering slash STEM professors in Lubbock, Texas,
329000	338000	witnessed multiple flights of 20 to 30 lights traveling at incredible speeds in a perfect semi-circle formation.
338000	342000	Grudge infers and marks this case down to a flock of migrating birds,
342000	348000	even though this explanation is unsubstantiated and not shared by the professor witnesses.
348000	354000	J. Allen Heineck, the future Blue Book scientific advisor, stated that Project Grudge was, quote,
354000	360000	less science and more of a public relations campaign.
360000	368000	In my association with Project Blue Book, I know very well that it was not a scientific project.
368000	374000	I also know that they never, never would notify the media when an interesting case came up.
374000	380000	They did everything they could to keep it down, so they definitely withheld information.
380000	386000	You know, when I first interviewed Allen years ago, there was a theory going around that anybody who saw a flying saucer
386000	390000	was probably be followed by swamp gas somewhere in Louisiana and didn't know what he or she was seeing.
390000	392000	We've had a lot of documentation since that time.
392000	397000	I think one of the main things that has come out here that Peter has done
397000	401000	is to substantiate the credibility of many of the civilians.
401000	409000	Now, Project Blue Book ran from 1952 to 1969 and is where the true UFO stigma was born.
409000	414000	Blue Book, of course, is the most well-known USG official UFO study
414000	419000	and was founded to determine if UFOs were in fact a threat to national security
419000	422000	and to scientifically analyze UFO data.
422000	430000	Fun fact, from 1952 to 1969, Blue Book analyzed 12,618 UFO reports,
430000	436000	701 of which were classified as unexplained after extensive analysis.
436000	442000	I've talked at length before about how J. Allen Heineck stated Blue Book was essentially a disinformation project
442000	448000	and a distraction tool used to cover up and gloss over the UFO issue.
448000	452000	We won't tread on Heineck too much, but who was Heineck?
452000	459000	Astrophysicist Dr. J. Allen Heineck served as the public advisor and scientific advisor to Project Blue Book
459000	465000	and lives in infamy for self-admittedly participating in the UFO cover-up.
465000	469000	During the tenure of Project Blue Book, Heineck's dissatisfaction for the ridicule
469000	474000	and planned debunking of credible UFO reports was a, quote, open secret,
474000	478000	but the doctors spoke openly about this after leaving Blue Book.
478000	483000	If you think back to the classic misexplanations of swamp gas and weather balloons,
483000	489000	Heineck was one of the key individuals who pushed to deliver these hypotheses on a national stage.
489000	499000	But how did Project Blue Book do this and how did they warp the entire American public perception on UFOs?
499000	509000	In December of 1952, one of the most famous mass UFO sightings in American history occurred over Washington, D.C., our nation's capital.
509000	517000	Over a series of nights, a group of lights accompanied with radar signatures appeared over Washington, D.C.
517000	522000	Many reported physical craft were seen, including the pilots of a B-52 bomber,
522000	528000	and at the time serious consideration was put towards this case being the craft of E.T. Origin.
528000	531000	This event often referred to as the Invasion of Washington,
531000	535000	where the Washington National Airport sightings took the nation by storm,
535000	541000	leading to 148 national newspapers covering the event in the following six-month period.
541000	544000	What followed captivated our country even more?
544000	550000	On July of 1952, USAF Major General John Sanford, USAF Director of Intelligence,
550000	553000	and USAF Director of Operations Roger M. Ramey,
553000	559000	yes, the same General Ramey that ordered Jesse Marcell to pose with fake wreckage to curb the Roswell crash,
559000	561000	held a press conference at the Pentagon.
561000	565000	During the conference, Sanford explains the way the bulk of UFO reports,
565000	569000	quote, to their own satisfaction as hoaxes,
569000	576000	erroneously identified friendly aircraft as meteorological or electric phenomena, or as light aberration.
576000	578000	However, he goes on to quote,
578000	586000	There have been a certain percentage of this volume of reports that have been made by credible observers of relatively incredible things.
586000	599000	Sanford then referenced the DC incident by saying that in no way were the sightings related to any secret development by any department of the United States.
599000	606000	But in 1953, the USG and CIA walked back and flipped Sanford's statements on their head
606000	609000	by forming the Robertson Panel.
609000	615000	Under the guise of mass panic and to alter public reaction to UFOs as stated by Dr. Heineck himself,
615000	626000	physicist and CIA consultant Howard P. Robertson was directed to review all Air Force case files on UFOs from Project Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book.
626000	630000	Oh, and by the way, at this same time behind the scenes,
630000	638000	the Tell Memorial Institute, who has a storied connection to UFO, especially material analysis around the 50s,
638000	642000	was commissioned to separately review all Air Force case files.
642000	650000	Anyways, the panel met for a series of four formal meetings and conducted such riveting analysis as
650000	656000	reviewing 23 of 2,331 provided USAF UFO cases on record,
656000	660000	watching two films of UFOs and comparing them to seagulls,
660000	664000	discussing the problems inherent to monitoring UFO sightings,
664000	668000	and finally meeting with USAF Major Dewey J. Fornette.
668000	678000	Fornette spoke to the panel that for a year he had coordinated UFO affairs for the Pentagon and supported the extraterrestrial hypothesis for some unexplained cases.
678000	682000	The panel spent the rest of that fourth day discussing that meeting.
682000	689000	The Robertson panel concluded that all national security agencies should strip UFOs of, quote, special status,
689000	694000	and suggest to the public that there is no legitimate evidence of their existence.
694000	703000	However, signatory to the report Thornton L. Page admits on the 3rd of October in 1993 that the chairman told members ahead of the meeting
703000	710000	to debunk all UFO reports presented to them, and to, quote, reduce public concern.
710000	716000	And what's also really important to note is that the Robertson panel was held a month after USAF Colonel Donald L. Bauer
716000	725000	forbade Captain Edward J. Ruppelt from visiting the CIA Office of Special Investigations to share information on compelling UFO data.
725000	732000	So what we can derive here is the Robertson's panel's conclusions were predetermined in order to devalue UFOs
732000	737000	and attribute them to nonsense and misidentified prosaic phenomena.
737000	745000	In fact, Dr. Heineck quotes that the panel was handed down the unwritten law of the Air Force.
745000	750000	Don't rock the boat, play it cool, and don't get the public excited.
750000	762000	What is awfully curious here is that after UFOs had been publicly denounced, the subsequent year, 1953, USAF issues Regulation 200-2.
762000	769000	This piece restricts UFO reporting procedures and supersedes the former AFL 200-5.
769000	776000	This means all confirmed UFO reports were to be sent to the Air Force Intelligence and not Blue Book.
776000	787000	This included reports by USAF personnel, and this keeps credible sightings from both Congress and the American people.
787000	796000	On the 5th of April 1966, Congress held its first closed session on UFOs in a hearing by the House Armed Services Committee.
796000	803000	Former President and at the time Congressman Gerald Ford noted the ridicule he received for arranging the hearings,
803000	811000	quote, as I expected some persons have ridiculed my call for a congressional investigation into unidentified flying objects.
811000	820000	Part of Ford's reasoning for calling for the hearings was dissatisfaction in Heineck's explanations of UFOs as swamp gas or weather balloons,
820000	827000	particularly the 1966 Dexter, Michigan mass UFO citing Heineck devalued as swamp gas.
827000	839000	On the panels had Blue Book head from 63 to 69, USAF Major Hector Quintanilla, J. Allen Heineck, and Secretary of the Air Force Harold D. Brown.
839000	845000	On this panel, Quintanilla tells the House Armed Services Committee that Project Blue Book had, quote,
845000	855000	no radar cases that are unexplained, explaining the vast majority of radar detections away as temperature inversions or just misidentified phenomena.
855000	863000	This was an irrefutable lie seen as Blue Book reports show numerous radar unknowns alongside corroborating witness testimony.
863000	874000	This lie was later pointed out by Dr. Heineck himself who pointed out several anomalous radar detections that stumped Blue Book including 1951 Goose Bay, 1956,
874000	878000	Lake and Heath, and 1957 Shrevaport.
878000	884000	Due to his dissatisfaction as being used as a, quote, puppet of the Air Force, who, quote,
884000	895000	only says what the Air Force wants me to say, Heineck prepared a surprise statement for the hearings requesting the USAF commission a civilian panel of physical and social scientists
895000	905000	to examine the UFO problem critically for the express purpose of determining whether a major problem exists.
905000	912000	Both Heineck and physicist James E. McDonald requested but were denied a seat on this panel.
912000	923000	Instead, in the summer of 1966 physicist Edward Condon of the University of Colorado Boulder, my rival university, so I don't like them, was selected.
923000	932000	Condon was well known amongst the scientific community for his tenacious work on the House Un-American Activities Committee and a suitable candidate for the job.
932000	939000	And I'm sure the modest sum of $313,000 for a year's work didn't hurt.
939000	949000	Condon received multiple requests to brief the committee by retired USMC Major Donald Keyhoe, ARPO, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization,
949000	956000	NICAP, McDonald, and Heineck, all of whom agreed to share any and all research files on UFOs.
956000	965000	Condon declined many of these offers. The committee moved very slowly, hampered by the apparent lack of funds and methodology.
965000	973000	Lacking subject matter expertise, and strangely enough, committee members usually worked without coordination with one another.
973000	983000	In late 1967, Condon stated in a public lecture he thought the government should not study UFOs because the subject matter was nonsense,
983000	987000	adding, quote, but I'm not supposed to reach that conclusion for another year.
987000	998000	This is a very strange statement seen as, in this time, Condon has been contracted to investigate UFOs, not have a conclusion.
998000	1009000	In 1967, the aforementioned James E. McDonald made public a 1966 memo written by the Condon Committee's second-in-command, Robert J. Lowe,
1009000	1018000	who wrote to two University of Colorado admins that they could expect the study to demonstrate that UFO observations had no basis in reality.
1018000	1026000	Conclusions before findings. This trick memo was written by Lowe, who was a hardened skeptic heading into the committee,
1026000	1031000	and the paper trail does in fact exist that he served in the CIA before teaching at CU Boulder.
1031000	1039000	Quote, the trick would be, I think, to describe the project so that, to the public, it would appear a totally objective study,
1039000	1050000	but to the scientific community would present the image of a group of non-believers trying their best to be objective but having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer.
1051000	1056000	One way to do this would be to stress investigation, not the physical phenomena,
1056000	1064000	but rather of the people who do the observing, the psychology and sociology of persons and groups who report seen UFOs.
1064000	1071000	If the emphasis were put here, rather than on examination of the old question of the physical reality of the saucer,
1071000	1075000	I think the scientific community would quickly get the message.
1075000	1081000	This trick, by the alleged CIA asset and second in command to the Condon Committee, Robert Lowe,
1081000	1086000	perfectly details the UFO stigma and how it would operate moving forward.
1086000	1091000	Forget the citing, no matter how credible, question the psychology of the observer.
1095000	1102000	The final nails in the coffin of serious UFO study would be hammered in by the release of the Condon Report
1102000	1107000	and subsequent Condon Report review by the National Academy of Sciences.
1107000	1114000	The Condon Report released as a book, both hardcover and soft, to be consumed by the public.
1114000	1118000	In his conclusions and recommendations, Condon stated, quote,
1118000	1126000	Our general conclusion is that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge.
1126000	1133000	Careful consideration of the record, as it is available to us, leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs
1133000	1139000	probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby.
1139000	1147000	He recommends that the Air Force and USG at large shut down and prohibit any investigation into UFOs.
1147000	1155000	The report seemingly does away with the scientific method to explain all cases away as conventional or natural explanations.
1155000	1160000	James E. McDonald calls the report inadequate and said, quote,
1160000	1167000	It represents an examination of only a tiny fraction of the most puzzling UFO reports of the past two decades
1167000	1171000	and that its level of scientific argument is wholly unsatisfactory.
1171000	1176000	Both McDonald and Heineck publicly stated that the committee ignored key evidence
1176000	1180000	and could not explain 25 to 30% of the cases examined.
1180000	1187000	Because the Condon committee was unable to explain one quarter of the cases that were submitted that they studied.
1187000	1191000	I'm curious, and I think everyone is now thinking the obvious question.
1191000	1194000	How did they handle that in their report, the ones they couldn't explain?
1194000	1199000	Well, very nicely and very adroitly, I use the word.
1199000	1205000	Dr. Condon wrote this summary and completely neglected the contents of the report.
1205000	1209000	The report received almost universal praise from the news media,
1209000	1217000	with many magazines, journals and newspapers publishing approving reviews or positive editorials of the Condon report.
1217000	1224000	Some of these compared any continued belief in UFOs to those who believe the earth is flat
1224000	1229000	or believe in ghosts and Bigfoot or other supernatural or unsubstantiated phenomena.
1229000	1234000	Others predicted that the interest in UFOs would die in a few generations
1234000	1238000	and only be dimly remembered as a candle flick in the darkness.
1238000	1244000	Science, the official publication of the American Association for Advancement of Science said,
1244000	1253000	quote, the Colorado study is unquestionably the most thorough and sophisticated investigation of the nebulous UFO phenomena ever conducted.
1253000	1259000	In 1969, the National Academy of Sciences wrote a review of the committee,
1259000	1264000	citing Condon's work as sound, approving of his methodology,
1264000	1269000	and agreeing in his assertions that there should be no more formal investigation into UFO.
1269000	1274000	In 1970, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics
1274000	1278000	made official statements agreeing with Condon's suggestion
1278000	1283000	Little of value had been uncovered by scientific UFO studies.
1283000	1291000	UFOs were now lumped in the same boat as ghosts, Bigfoot and other fringe topics or conspiracy,
1291000	1296000	a subject to be scoffed and laughed at instead of disgust and studied.
1296000	1303000	UFO was now synonymous with tinfoil hat conspiracists instead of the accredited physicists
1303000	1308000	like Heineck and McDonald who wished for nothing more than to study UFO.
1308000	1313000	Sine, Grudge, Blue Book, the Robertson Panel and the Condon Committee
1313000	1317000	were all guised as serious investigation into UFOs,
1317000	1323000	truly used to publicly discredit the phenomena while real research went on behind the scenes.
1323000	1329000	All of these tools culminated in 1969 so the USG could say, quote,
1329000	1333000	UFOs do not exist and we do not study them.
1333000	1337000	However, of course we know that this is not true
1337000	1344000	and this stigma was created for the purposeful distraction to take eyes off the UFO study.
1359000	1364000	There are times in your life where you have been worried to speak to a certain person
1364000	1369000	or people's about UFO or judge somebody because they've brought up UFO
1369000	1372000	or thought, maybe I shouldn't talk about this.
1372000	1379000	It's no secret the UFO phenomena has a massive stigma around it associated with conspiracy,
1379000	1383000	with whack jobs, with ghosts and Bigfoot.
1383000	1388000	And as we've seen in this video, that's very real and very planned.
1388000	1393000	The sophisticated disinformation campaigns Grudge talks about here is those in effect.
1393000	1399000	Project Sine, Project Grudge, Blue Book, the Robertson Panel, the Condon Committee,
1399000	1407000	all of these have been used as tools to ridicule the study of anomalous things in our skies.
1407000	1412000	It's absurd, absolutely absurd, all under the guise of scientific research.
1412000	1414000	I hope you learned something today.
1414000	1416000	I certainly did.
1416000	1418000	Making this video, there was a ton of research to go into it.
1418000	1421000	I got to read the whole Grudge and Blue Book reports,
1421000	1423000	a ton of interesting cases I want to cover.
1423000	1427000	But I will put every case I can in the video description.
1427000	1429000	Many of them I have are PDFs.
1429000	1436000	So if you'd like to get them all yourself, please email me at uapgerb.com or join my Discord in the description.
1436000	1439000	I will actually have a channel for all of the case files.
1439000	1442000	But did I miss anything in this video?
1442000	1444000	Or anything else I should have covered?
1444000	1448000	How did you beat the UFO stigma in your personal life?
1448000	1451000	How did you overcome this woo and begin talking about it freely?
1451000	1457000	I know that I overcame this stigma from very early on when I pieced together that hey,
1457000	1462000	UFOs are being studied by the United States government both publicly and in the shadows.
1462000	1465000	So why are they being shamed?
1465000	1470000	It's fascinating and unfortunately this stigma has been wildly successful.
1470000	1472000	So thank you guys, I appreciate you joining me.
1472000	1474000	Please remember to like and subscribe.
1474000	1477000	I will catch everybody on the next UAP Gerb Show.
1477000	1478000	Bye.
