  \ for full case files from this investigation \n\nEven in 2024, when someone mentions\
  \ UFOs in private or professional circles, they are often scoffed at and met with\
  \ ridicule. Historically, mentioning a UAP sighting by a commercial or military\
  \ pilot has been a death sentence, and politicians/military personnel avoid any\
  \ mention of unidentified craft to maintain \"sound mind\".\n\nBut where and why\
  \ did this stigma begin? Was it conducted purposefully to alter public perception\
  \ of the phenomena? In today's video, we will walk through the carefully conducted\
  \ disinformation campaign orchestrated by the USG, CIA, and USG Military throughout\
  \ the 1950s and 1960s to lump the study of UFO and \"flying saucer\" with the likes\
  \ of paranormal topics such as ghosts, bigfoot, Illuminati conspiracy, etc. \n\n\
  By leveraging the USG and USAF official UFO investigation studies - Sign, Grudge,\
  \ and Blue Book, as well as orchestrating the famous Robertson Panel and Condon\
  \ Committee, all scientific investigation ability was stripped of UFOs and the subject\
  \ became pseudoscience. \n\nOf course, we know even with the termination of Project\
  \ Blue Book in 1969, the USG maintained rigid study into UFO until the present day....\
