00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I've been studying UFOs. I've been studying UFOs. Did you know there are UFOs out here flying around? Unidentified UFOs.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
This would be the place for them, Southern California.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
It could be aliens, it could be balloons, or it could be alien balloons.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
President Obama says that there is footage and records of objects in the skies.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
He's asked these unidentified aerial phenomenon and he says we don't know exactly what they are.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
What do you think that it is?

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
I would ask him again. Thank you.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
The reality of the unidentified aerial or submerged phenomena is not up for debate.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
It is fact there are anomalous signatures that operate in our skies, oceans, and near-Earth orbit

00:52.000 --> 01:06.000
that exhibit strange and astounding characteristics including instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic velocity, anti-gravity, low observability, and transmedial travel.

01:06.000 --> 01:14.000
Whether you recognize the phenomena as non-human in origin, or believe that these signatures are advanced hidden human technology,

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
or any combination of these is up to you in all of these warrant future investigation.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
But no matter what you believe, you cannot deny the UFO study is looked at with ridicule, disdain, laughter, and has historically been treated as a joke.

01:29.000 --> 01:37.000
But where did this UFO stigma come from and why is studying anomalous signatures on this planet looked at as silly?

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
Why have civilian and military pilots historically been advised not to share UFO sightings,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
fearing revocation of their flight status?

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
Why is serious scientific investigation into UFOs laughed at as seen as a fruitless venture?

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
There are three things about this whole thing, Tom, that no one can deny.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
There are incontrovertible points, even the grossest skeptic can't deny.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
The first of all is that the UFO reports not only exist but persist.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
When I started with the Air Force, I thought that this was a fad and a few years would just disappear.

02:09.000 --> 02:17.000
And it's global, we have reports now from 140 countries, practically as many countries as there are in the United Nations,

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
and the most important of these three things is that many, unfortunately not all,

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
but many of the reports come from highly, highly credible, technically trained people, you see.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
I am UAP Curb, guys, and today I wanted to do a review on the history of the UFO stigma

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
and highlight how this narrative of UFO being nothing more than misidentified prosaic phenomena

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
and only studied by tin foil conspiracies and whack jobs,

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
has in fact been pushed and perpetrated by our own United States government.

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
We could realistically start with the 1946 Kenneth Arnold saucer sightings or the Roswell crash of 1947,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
but you know me, let's start where our paper trail leads us.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
So let's take a peek at the first official USG program, Investigating UFOs.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Project Sign began in 1948 and ran until 1949.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
United States Air Force General Nathan Twinning established this project,

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
initially naming Sign Project Saucer due to Lieutenant General Twinning's assertion that flying discs are, quote,

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
real and not visionary or fictitious, as seen in this letter to AAF commanding General George Shlugen.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.000
The written sign report states that some UFO reports present actual objects, but origins are undeterminable.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Edward J. Ruppelt, future director of Project Blue Book and Grudge,

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
claimed Sign endorsed the interplanetary explanation for some of the unexplained signed sightings.

03:54.000 --> 04:02.000
If you know UAP Gerb, you know any official United States government UFO investigation can be traced to the DOE or parents,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
the AEC, the Atomic Energy Commission.

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
Well, get this, all sign reports were required to be sent to the Army and Navy Research and Development Board,

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
the USAF Scientific Advisory Group and the Atomic Energy Commission.

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
The program was shut down in 1949 by General Hoyt Vandenberg for, quote, lack of proof,

04:24.000 --> 04:32.000
but the next official investigation into UFOs was commissioned the exact same year.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
Project Grudge ran throughout 1949 when it was officially terminated,

04:38.000 --> 04:46.000
but Grudge records were updated up until 1999, featuring a full published report in 1960.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
Reviewing the Grudge report is not the topic of this video, but seen as it is 707 pages of case analysis,

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
maybe I'll do a most interesting cases on Grudge reports video someday.

04:58.000 --> 05:07.000
Anyways, USAF formed this program specifically intending to alleviate public anxiety over UFOs.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
Here we can see the first real breadcrumbs of the USG trying to alter public perception of UFOs.

05:14.000 --> 05:23.000
Grudge was tasked to explain sightings away as balloons, conventional aircraft, optical illusions, planets, mass hallucinations, etc.,

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
such as in the case of the Lubbock lights, where four engineering slash STEM professors in Lubbock, Texas,

05:29.000 --> 05:38.000
witnessed multiple flights of 20 to 30 lights traveling at incredible speeds in a perfect semi-circle formation.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Grudge infers and marks this case down to a flock of migrating birds,

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
even though this explanation is unsubstantiated and not shared by the professor witnesses.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
J. Allen Heineck, the future Blue Book scientific advisor, stated that Project Grudge was, quote,

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
less science and more of a public relations campaign.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
In my association with Project Blue Book, I know very well that it was not a scientific project.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
I also know that they never, never would notify the media when an interesting case came up.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
They did everything they could to keep it down, so they definitely withheld information.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
You know, when I first interviewed Allen years ago, there was a theory going around that anybody who saw a flying saucer

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
was probably be followed by swamp gas somewhere in Louisiana and didn't know what he or she was seeing.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
We've had a lot of documentation since that time.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
I think one of the main things that has come out here that Peter has done

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
is to substantiate the credibility of many of the civilians.

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
Now, Project Blue Book ran from 1952 to 1969 and is where the true UFO stigma was born.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
Blue Book, of course, is the most well-known USG official UFO study

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
and was founded to determine if UFOs were in fact a threat to national security

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
and to scientifically analyze UFO data.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
Fun fact, from 1952 to 1969, Blue Book analyzed 12,618 UFO reports,

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
701 of which were classified as unexplained after extensive analysis.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
I've talked at length before about how J. Allen Heineck stated Blue Book was essentially a disinformation project

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
and a distraction tool used to cover up and gloss over the UFO issue.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
We won't tread on Heineck too much, but who was Heineck?

07:32.000 --> 07:39.000
Astrophysicist Dr. J. Allen Heineck served as the public advisor and scientific advisor to Project Blue Book

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
and lives in infamy for self-admittedly participating in the UFO cover-up.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
During the tenure of Project Blue Book, Heineck's dissatisfaction for the ridicule

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
and planned debunking of credible UFO reports was a, quote, open secret,

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
but the doctors spoke openly about this after leaving Blue Book.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
If you think back to the classic misexplanations of swamp gas and weather balloons,

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
Heineck was one of the key individuals who pushed to deliver these hypotheses on a national stage.

08:09.000 --> 08:19.000
But how did Project Blue Book do this and how did they warp the entire American public perception on UFOs?

08:19.000 --> 08:29.000
In December of 1952, one of the most famous mass UFO sightings in American history occurred over Washington, D.C., our nation's capital.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
Over a series of nights, a group of lights accompanied with radar signatures appeared over Washington, D.C.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Many reported physical craft were seen, including the pilots of a B-52 bomber,

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
and at the time serious consideration was put towards this case being the craft of E.T. Origin.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
This event often referred to as the Invasion of Washington,

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
where the Washington National Airport sightings took the nation by storm,

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
leading to 148 national newspapers covering the event in the following six-month period.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
What followed captivated our country even more?

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
On July of 1952, USAF Major General John Sanford, USAF Director of Intelligence,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
and USAF Director of Operations Roger M. Ramey,

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
yes, the same General Ramey that ordered Jesse Marcell to pose with fake wreckage to curb the Roswell crash,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
held a press conference at the Pentagon.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
During the conference, Sanford explains the way the bulk of UFO reports,

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
quote, to their own satisfaction as hoaxes,

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
erroneously identified friendly aircraft as meteorological or electric phenomena, or as light aberration.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
However, he goes on to quote,

09:38.000 --> 09:46.000
There have been a certain percentage of this volume of reports that have been made by credible observers of relatively incredible things.

09:46.000 --> 09:59.000
Sanford then referenced the DC incident by saying that in no way were the sightings related to any secret development by any department of the United States.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
But in 1953, the USG and CIA walked back and flipped Sanford's statements on their head

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
by forming the Robertson Panel.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
Under the guise of mass panic and to alter public reaction to UFOs as stated by Dr. Heineck himself,

10:15.000 --> 10:26.000
physicist and CIA consultant Howard P. Robertson was directed to review all Air Force case files on UFOs from Project Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Oh, and by the way, at this same time behind the scenes,

10:30.000 --> 10:38.000
the Tell Memorial Institute, who has a storied connection to UFO, especially material analysis around the 50s,

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
was commissioned to separately review all Air Force case files.

10:42.000 --> 10:50.000
Anyways, the panel met for a series of four formal meetings and conducted such riveting analysis as

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
reviewing 23 of 2,331 provided USAF UFO cases on record,

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
watching two films of UFOs and comparing them to seagulls,

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
discussing the problems inherent to monitoring UFO sightings,

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
and finally meeting with USAF Major Dewey J. Fornette.

11:08.000 --> 11:18.000
Fornette spoke to the panel that for a year he had coordinated UFO affairs for the Pentagon and supported the extraterrestrial hypothesis for some unexplained cases.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
The panel spent the rest of that fourth day discussing that meeting.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
The Robertson panel concluded that all national security agencies should strip UFOs of, quote, special status,

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
and suggest to the public that there is no legitimate evidence of their existence.

11:34.000 --> 11:43.000
However, signatory to the report Thornton L. Page admits on the 3rd of October in 1993 that the chairman told members ahead of the meeting

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
to debunk all UFO reports presented to them, and to, quote, reduce public concern.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
And what's also really important to note is that the Robertson panel was held a month after USAF Colonel Donald L. Bauer

11:56.000 --> 12:05.000
forbade Captain Edward J. Ruppelt from visiting the CIA Office of Special Investigations to share information on compelling UFO data.

12:05.000 --> 12:12.000
So what we can derive here is the Robertson's panel's conclusions were predetermined in order to devalue UFOs

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
and attribute them to nonsense and misidentified prosaic phenomena.

12:17.000 --> 12:25.000
In fact, Dr. Heineck quotes that the panel was handed down the unwritten law of the Air Force.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
Don't rock the boat, play it cool, and don't get the public excited.

12:30.000 --> 12:42.000
What is awfully curious here is that after UFOs had been publicly denounced, the subsequent year, 1953, USAF issues Regulation 200-2.

12:42.000 --> 12:49.000
This piece restricts UFO reporting procedures and supersedes the former AFL 200-5.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
This means all confirmed UFO reports were to be sent to the Air Force Intelligence and not Blue Book.

12:56.000 --> 13:07.000
This included reports by USAF personnel, and this keeps credible sightings from both Congress and the American people.

13:07.000 --> 13:16.000
On the 5th of April 1966, Congress held its first closed session on UFOs in a hearing by the House Armed Services Committee.

13:16.000 --> 13:23.000
Former President and at the time Congressman Gerald Ford noted the ridicule he received for arranging the hearings,

13:23.000 --> 13:31.000
quote, as I expected some persons have ridiculed my call for a congressional investigation into unidentified flying objects.

13:31.000 --> 13:40.000
Part of Ford's reasoning for calling for the hearings was dissatisfaction in Heineck's explanations of UFOs as swamp gas or weather balloons,

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
particularly the 1966 Dexter, Michigan mass UFO citing Heineck devalued as swamp gas.

13:47.000 --> 13:59.000
On the panels had Blue Book head from 63 to 69, USAF Major Hector Quintanilla, J. Allen Heineck, and Secretary of the Air Force Harold D. Brown.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
On this panel, Quintanilla tells the House Armed Services Committee that Project Blue Book had, quote,

14:05.000 --> 14:15.000
no radar cases that are unexplained, explaining the vast majority of radar detections away as temperature inversions or just misidentified phenomena.

14:15.000 --> 14:23.000
This was an irrefutable lie seen as Blue Book reports show numerous radar unknowns alongside corroborating witness testimony.

14:23.000 --> 14:34.000
This lie was later pointed out by Dr. Heineck himself who pointed out several anomalous radar detections that stumped Blue Book including 1951 Goose Bay, 1956,

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Lake and Heath, and 1957 Shrevaport.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
Due to his dissatisfaction as being used as a, quote, puppet of the Air Force, who, quote,

14:44.000 --> 14:55.000
only says what the Air Force wants me to say, Heineck prepared a surprise statement for the hearings requesting the USAF commission a civilian panel of physical and social scientists

14:55.000 --> 15:05.000
to examine the UFO problem critically for the express purpose of determining whether a major problem exists.

15:05.000 --> 15:12.000
Both Heineck and physicist James E. McDonald requested but were denied a seat on this panel.

15:12.000 --> 15:23.000
Instead, in the summer of 1966 physicist Edward Condon of the University of Colorado Boulder, my rival university, so I don't like them, was selected.

15:23.000 --> 15:32.000
Condon was well known amongst the scientific community for his tenacious work on the House Un-American Activities Committee and a suitable candidate for the job.

15:32.000 --> 15:39.000
And I'm sure the modest sum of $313,000 for a year's work didn't hurt.

15:39.000 --> 15:49.000
Condon received multiple requests to brief the committee by retired USMC Major Donald Keyhoe, ARPO, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization,

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
NICAP, McDonald, and Heineck, all of whom agreed to share any and all research files on UFOs.

15:56.000 --> 16:05.000
Condon declined many of these offers. The committee moved very slowly, hampered by the apparent lack of funds and methodology.

16:05.000 --> 16:13.000
Lacking subject matter expertise, and strangely enough, committee members usually worked without coordination with one another.

16:13.000 --> 16:23.000
In late 1967, Condon stated in a public lecture he thought the government should not study UFOs because the subject matter was nonsense,

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
adding, quote, but I'm not supposed to reach that conclusion for another year.

16:27.000 --> 16:38.000
This is a very strange statement seen as, in this time, Condon has been contracted to investigate UFOs, not have a conclusion.

16:38.000 --> 16:49.000
In 1967, the aforementioned James E. McDonald made public a 1966 memo written by the Condon Committee's second-in-command, Robert J. Lowe,

16:49.000 --> 16:58.000
who wrote to two University of Colorado admins that they could expect the study to demonstrate that UFO observations had no basis in reality.

16:58.000 --> 17:06.000
Conclusions before findings. This trick memo was written by Lowe, who was a hardened skeptic heading into the committee,

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
and the paper trail does in fact exist that he served in the CIA before teaching at CU Boulder.

17:11.000 --> 17:19.000
Quote, the trick would be, I think, to describe the project so that, to the public, it would appear a totally objective study,

17:19.000 --> 17:30.000
but to the scientific community would present the image of a group of non-believers trying their best to be objective but having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
One way to do this would be to stress investigation, not the physical phenomena,

17:36.000 --> 17:44.000
but rather of the people who do the observing, the psychology and sociology of persons and groups who report seen UFOs.

17:44.000 --> 17:51.000
If the emphasis were put here, rather than on examination of the old question of the physical reality of the saucer,

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
I think the scientific community would quickly get the message.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
This trick, by the alleged CIA asset and second in command to the Condon Committee, Robert Lowe,

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
perfectly details the UFO stigma and how it would operate moving forward.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
Forget the citing, no matter how credible, question the psychology of the observer.

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
The final nails in the coffin of serious UFO study would be hammered in by the release of the Condon Report

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
and subsequent Condon Report review by the National Academy of Sciences.

18:27.000 --> 18:34.000
The Condon Report released as a book, both hardcover and soft, to be consumed by the public.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
In his conclusions and recommendations, Condon stated, quote,

18:38.000 --> 18:46.000
Our general conclusion is that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
Careful consideration of the record, as it is available to us, leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby.

18:59.000 --> 19:07.000
He recommends that the Air Force and USG at large shut down and prohibit any investigation into UFOs.

19:07.000 --> 19:15.000
The report seemingly does away with the scientific method to explain all cases away as conventional or natural explanations.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
James E. McDonald calls the report inadequate and said, quote,

19:20.000 --> 19:27.000
It represents an examination of only a tiny fraction of the most puzzling UFO reports of the past two decades

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
and that its level of scientific argument is wholly unsatisfactory.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
Both McDonald and Heineck publicly stated that the committee ignored key evidence

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
and could not explain 25 to 30% of the cases examined.

19:40.000 --> 19:47.000
Because the Condon committee was unable to explain one quarter of the cases that were submitted that they studied.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
I'm curious, and I think everyone is now thinking the obvious question.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
How did they handle that in their report, the ones they couldn't explain?

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
Well, very nicely and very adroitly, I use the word.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
Dr. Condon wrote this summary and completely neglected the contents of the report.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
The report received almost universal praise from the news media,

20:09.000 --> 20:17.000
with many magazines, journals and newspapers publishing approving reviews or positive editorials of the Condon report.

20:17.000 --> 20:24.000
Some of these compared any continued belief in UFOs to those who believe the earth is flat

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
or believe in ghosts and Bigfoot or other supernatural or unsubstantiated phenomena.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
Others predicted that the interest in UFOs would die in a few generations

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
and only be dimly remembered as a candle flick in the darkness.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
Science, the official publication of the American Association for Advancement of Science said,

20:44.000 --> 20:53.000
quote, the Colorado study is unquestionably the most thorough and sophisticated investigation of the nebulous UFO phenomena ever conducted.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
In 1969, the National Academy of Sciences wrote a review of the committee,

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
citing Condon's work as sound, approving of his methodology,

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
and agreeing in his assertions that there should be no more formal investigation into UFO.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
In 1970, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
made official statements agreeing with Condon's suggestion

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
Little of value had been uncovered by scientific UFO studies.

21:23.000 --> 21:31.000
UFOs were now lumped in the same boat as ghosts, Bigfoot and other fringe topics or conspiracy,

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
a subject to be scoffed and laughed at instead of disgust and studied.

21:36.000 --> 21:43.000
UFO was now synonymous with tinfoil hat conspiracists instead of the accredited physicists

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
like Heineck and McDonald who wished for nothing more than to study UFO.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
Sine, Grudge, Blue Book, the Robertson Panel and the Condon Committee

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
were all guised as serious investigation into UFOs,

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
truly used to publicly discredit the phenomena while real research went on behind the scenes.

22:03.000 --> 22:09.000
All of these tools culminated in 1969 so the USG could say, quote,

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
UFOs do not exist and we do not study them.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
However, of course we know that this is not true

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
and this stigma was created for the purposeful distraction to take eyes off the UFO study.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
There are times in your life where you have been worried to speak to a certain person

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
or people's about UFO or judge somebody because they've brought up UFO

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
or thought, maybe I shouldn't talk about this.

22:52.000 --> 22:59.000
It's no secret the UFO phenomena has a massive stigma around it associated with conspiracy,

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
with whack jobs, with ghosts and Bigfoot.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
And as we've seen in this video, that's very real and very planned.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
The sophisticated disinformation campaigns Grudge talks about here is those in effect.

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
Project Sine, Project Grudge, Blue Book, the Robertson Panel, the Condon Committee,

23:19.000 --> 23:27.000
all of these have been used as tools to ridicule the study of anomalous things in our skies.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
It's absurd, absolutely absurd, all under the guise of scientific research.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I hope you learned something today.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I certainly did.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Making this video, there was a ton of research to go into it.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
I got to read the whole Grudge and Blue Book reports,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
a ton of interesting cases I want to cover.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
But I will put every case I can in the video description.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Many of them I have are PDFs.

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
So if you'd like to get them all yourself, please email me at uapgerb.com or join my Discord in the description.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
I will actually have a channel for all of the case files.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
But did I miss anything in this video?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Or anything else I should have covered?

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
How did you beat the UFO stigma in your personal life?

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
How did you overcome this woo and begin talking about it freely?

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
I know that I overcame this stigma from very early on when I pieced together that hey,

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
UFOs are being studied by the United States government both publicly and in the shadows.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
So why are they being shamed?

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
It's fascinating and unfortunately this stigma has been wildly successful.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
So thank you guys, I appreciate you joining me.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Please remember to like and subscribe.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
I will catch everybody on the next UAP Gerb Show.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Bye.
