00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Until recently, UFOs have been seen as anomalous craft operating in deep space, near Earth orbit,

00:08.000 --> 00:12.360
within Earth's atmosphere, and occasionally, whether purposefully or due to a mysterious

00:12.360 --> 00:15.480
crash, touching our planet's surface.

00:15.480 --> 00:20.120
But a fascinating aspect of the trans-medium capabilities of these craft has long been

00:20.120 --> 00:21.560
forgotten.

00:21.560 --> 00:25.480
Until Commander David Fraver's sighting of the tic-tac, which seemingly communicated

00:25.480 --> 00:30.600
with something churning under the water's surface, military footage showing UAP entering

00:30.600 --> 00:36.840
or leaving Earth's waters, in the incredible efforts of Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet.

00:36.840 --> 00:41.320
What's up guys, it's UAPGurb, and today I want to cover the history and some famous

00:41.320 --> 00:48.520
historical sightings of one of the most overlooked aspects of the phenomenon, undersea UFOs,

00:48.520 --> 00:51.600
or unidentified submerged objects.

00:51.600 --> 00:56.640
The idea UFOs are not only operating in our skies, but also the most unexplored regions

00:56.640 --> 01:00.360
of our planet is both profound and somewhat disturbing.

01:00.360 --> 01:04.600
So let's not waste time, let's get right into it.

01:04.600 --> 01:11.400
Shockingly, the study of USOs is not a recent undertaking.

01:11.400 --> 01:17.800
In fact, we can head all the way back to the early days of Project Blue Book in 1951.

01:17.800 --> 01:23.280
USAF Major Dewey Fernet, Blue Book member, undertook one project interloper with the

01:23.280 --> 01:25.360
aid of the US Navy.

01:25.360 --> 01:31.040
The goal of this project was to investigate both aerial and undersea UAP.

01:31.040 --> 01:35.400
Regardless of serving as a sitting Blue Book member, Fernet's operation interloper was

01:35.400 --> 01:41.600
curiously an extra governmental investigation, meaning it was exempt from all Freedom of Information

01:41.600 --> 01:43.440
Act requests.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.880
Whether this was directed by USG Elements or not, I'm not quite sure.

01:47.880 --> 01:53.360
However, in 1953, interloper briefed the CIA, but the project's findings never reached

01:53.360 --> 01:55.440
Congress or the American people.

01:55.440 --> 02:02.760
Today, only three case files remain from Fernet's project, cases 26, 27, and 28.

02:02.760 --> 02:08.440
Case 26 covers US Navy Lieutenant George P. Williams, who alongside with his nine-man

02:08.440 --> 02:14.720
crew in their Navy Fleet Logistics Air Wing plane, observed a trans-medium UFO depart

02:14.720 --> 02:20.040
the ocean and traverse the skies between Kefalvik, Iceland, and Newfoundland.

02:20.040 --> 02:24.520
The object, initially mistaken for a ship, rose from beneath the clouds and approached

02:24.520 --> 02:28.640
the Navy aircraft at a, quote, terrifying closing rate.

02:28.640 --> 02:33.720
The object hovered near the air wing's port site before disappearing at alarming speeds.

02:33.720 --> 02:39.280
The object was described as elliptical or cigar-shaped, measuring a minimum of 200 feet

02:39.280 --> 02:42.920
with a red-orange glow along the periphery.

02:42.920 --> 02:48.320
The other two surviving cases do not fit our investigation today, but still check this out.

02:48.320 --> 02:53.600
Case 27 highlights the experience of a South African Airways constellation craft en route

02:53.600 --> 02:56.160
from London to Johannesburg.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.960
Near the Kenya border, the airplane crossed over the crater of a long-extinct volcano where

03:00.960 --> 03:05.960
the pilots noticed a silvery disk stationed deep within the crater.

03:05.960 --> 03:11.840
The disk took off at a high rate of speed straight up and out of sight of the craft.

03:11.840 --> 03:17.200
Next we can look at the 24th of April, 1952, where the Air Force Technical Intelligence

03:17.200 --> 03:26.220
Center is written by AFOIN-XSG, regarding the possible connection of submarine contacts.

03:26.220 --> 03:31.220
This letter addressed to one Colonel Dunn attaches nine reports of submarine contacts

03:31.220 --> 03:37.260
with UFOs, specifically flying disks, with the assistance of ONI, the Office of Naval

03:37.260 --> 03:38.260
Intelligence.

03:38.260 --> 03:43.860
Unfortunately, these reports are unavailable, but what is interesting are the Navy UFO sightings

03:43.860 --> 03:46.260
listed in the 1950s.

03:46.260 --> 03:52.260
This information is relayed in Timothy Goode's book, Need to Know, UFOs, the Military and

03:52.260 --> 03:53.260
Intelligence.

03:53.300 --> 03:57.340
This information is supplied by respected ufologist Leonard Stringfield, who I covered

03:57.340 --> 03:59.820
in the Kingman Air of Zona Crash.

03:59.820 --> 04:06.540
Stringfield was informed of thousands of ONI UAP reports from 1952 to 1956.

04:06.540 --> 04:12.340
But I skipped over this mysterious sender of the nine reports, AFOIN-XSG.

04:12.340 --> 04:19.100
AFOIN is the Air Force Office of Intelligence, and we can assume that this SG is a special

04:19.100 --> 04:20.100
group.

04:20.100 --> 04:25.860
Curiously, we can look back to Edward J. Ruppel, a man I have talked about extensively, who

04:25.860 --> 04:29.460
served as director of Project Grudge and Blue Book.

04:29.460 --> 04:34.820
Ruppel stated that AFOIN was conducting a more complete investigation of UFOs parallel

04:34.820 --> 04:38.700
to Blue Book in the later uncovered Battelle's Project Stork.

04:38.700 --> 04:44.900
Ruppel stated AFOIN's technical capabilities branch and collection control branch were specific

04:44.900 --> 04:47.820
offices doing UFO related work.

04:47.820 --> 04:52.220
Was this Air Force special group tasked with investigating the nine USO reports one of

04:52.220 --> 04:56.180
the US government's real secret UFO investigation groups?

04:56.180 --> 04:57.820
To me, it appears likely.

04:57.820 --> 05:03.580
In 1979, Kufan, the computer UFO network, filed FOIA requests for information on the

05:03.580 --> 05:05.660
mysterious special group.

05:05.660 --> 05:11.380
All requests were denied under executive order, citing the national security need to maintain

05:11.380 --> 05:12.780
classification.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.740
The trail here in the 1950s goes much deeper as well.

05:16.740 --> 05:24.100
In 1954, JANAP, the Joint Army Navy Air Force Publication, published Directive 146C, where

05:24.100 --> 05:30.740
both Airborne and Waterborne UFO were to be reported under service, communication instructions

05:30.740 --> 05:34.180
for reporting vital intelligence sightings, and Merrant.

05:34.180 --> 05:37.380
I'm guessing this means maritime intelligence.

05:37.380 --> 05:42.100
This meant both civilians and pilots were prohibited from discussing officially reported

05:42.100 --> 05:43.100
sightings.

05:43.100 --> 05:48.940
As service and Merrant sightings were subject to the Communications Act of 1934 and espionage

05:48.940 --> 05:54.740
laws, violators would receive a prison sentence and a $10,000 fine.

05:54.740 --> 05:58.340
And if you've watched a single one of my videos, you probably know I talk often about

05:58.340 --> 06:01.420
USAF Regulation 200-2.

06:01.420 --> 06:05.940
So I expect everybody knows that by heart, but if you don't, this regulation restricted

06:05.940 --> 06:09.980
all official UFO reporting to be sent to ATIC and not Blue Book.

06:10.380 --> 06:17.940
Well, in that same year, 1954, January 23rd, to be precise, the US Navy issued OPNAV, the

06:17.940 --> 06:24.500
Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Directive 3820, which required UAP sightings referenced

06:24.500 --> 06:30.620
as flying object reports, to be sent to the Director of ATIC, the Director of USAF Intelligence,

06:30.620 --> 06:32.980
and the Director of Naval Intelligence.

06:32.980 --> 06:37.180
This report, which we can find a copy of in Donald Keyho's book, The Flying Saucer

06:37.180 --> 06:41.500
Conspiracy, directly cites JANAP-146C.

06:41.500 --> 06:49.940
With the implementation of 1953's USAF Regulation 200-2, OPNAV Directive 3820, and JANAP-146C,

06:49.940 --> 06:55.460
we enter the slow descent into the dark ages of UFO reporting, starting with explanations

06:55.460 --> 06:57.740
of swamp gas and weather balloons.

06:57.740 --> 07:02.820
So our paper trail here becomes relatively sparse, and we have to start to rely on claims

07:02.820 --> 07:09.780
of USO studies and experiences.

07:09.780 --> 07:15.260
We must travel all the way to 1985, where ufologist Jacques VallÃ©e claims in Forbidden

07:15.260 --> 07:21.260
Science Pacific Heights, a collection of his personal journals, that a source at NARCAP,

07:21.260 --> 07:25.980
the National Aviation Reporting Center on anomalous phenomena, told him that a large

07:25.980 --> 07:31.540
collection of UFO and USO files were being stored at Norton Air Force Base.

07:31.660 --> 07:37.300
Norton has historically been associated with UAP or NHI research, such as being named by

07:37.300 --> 07:43.420
Stephen Greer and the disclosure project in his alleged briefing to Congress in 1996.

07:43.420 --> 07:47.980
But let's move on to a really curious rabbit hole from 2017.

07:47.980 --> 07:53.700
Of course, with an absence of official documentation, this story should be taken with some skepticism.

07:53.700 --> 07:57.180
But let's tackle the claims by astronomer Mark Dantonio.

07:57.180 --> 08:02.500
With Dantonio, president of FX Models, a company with naval contracts was taken for a ride

08:02.500 --> 08:07.140
in a naval submarine as a thank you for his company's contract work.

08:07.140 --> 08:12.460
While undersea, the sonar team picked up what they called a fast mover, traveling at several

08:12.460 --> 08:13.780
hundred knots.

08:13.780 --> 08:18.060
For reference, most submarines and torpedoes travel at roughly 40 knots.

08:18.060 --> 08:23.780
The commanding officer told the sonar operator to, quote, log it and dog it, end quote, essentially

08:23.780 --> 08:25.900
bury in the encounter.

08:25.900 --> 08:31.100
And years later, Mark asked a senior naval figure about the fast mover program.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.260
I bet you can all guess the response.

08:33.260 --> 08:36.540
Sorry, Mark, I can't talk about that program.

08:36.540 --> 08:41.060
These two Dantonio essentially confirmed the program's existence, especially since the

08:41.060 --> 08:46.420
figure told Mark that USOs were common and that there was a program in place to classify

08:46.420 --> 08:51.460
and log and determine the speed of them, but those reports go into a vault.

08:51.460 --> 08:55.260
Of course, remember, this is all just alleged testimony, we have no way to prove this right

08:55.300 --> 08:56.740
now.

08:56.740 --> 09:02.480
But the year of 2022 is where chatter around USO became much louder and really made its

09:02.480 --> 09:04.820
way into the public zeitgeist.

09:04.820 --> 09:09.260
I'd like to take a look at the published notes of Oak Shannon, a figure I haven't mentioned

09:09.260 --> 09:11.700
since the Wilson Davis memo video.

09:11.700 --> 09:16.740
Shannon, former manager of special projects at Los Alamos National Laboratories and Department

09:16.740 --> 09:21.260
of Energy Nuclear Physicists, confirmed the authenticity of the Wilson Davis memo, but

09:21.260 --> 09:23.260
that's not our focus for today.

09:23.260 --> 09:28.860
These notes, published in 2022, recall Oak's time at the Advanced Theoretical Working Group,

09:28.860 --> 09:34.660
held at BDM's International's McLean Secure Facility, and classified using DOE controls

09:34.660 --> 09:36.460
in 1985.

09:36.460 --> 09:41.340
These notes contain some fascinating information and I highly recommend reading them.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.620
You already know, just check the show notes.

09:43.620 --> 09:48.620
But alongside mention of some UFO hotspots such as Mount Hayes, Alaska, Shannon jots

09:48.620 --> 09:54.780
down the Navy has intelligence on an underwater UFO hotspot near Gulfo San Matisse off the

09:54.780 --> 09:56.700
coast of Argentina.

09:56.700 --> 10:02.320
And we can also look at ex-CIA operative John Ramirez, the man who made the Galactic Federations

10:02.320 --> 10:07.700
claims famous, who in 2022 claimed he had heard rumors of a relationship between the

10:07.700 --> 10:13.980
Office of Naval Research and the CIA Office of Scientific and Weapons Research slash WINPAC,

10:13.980 --> 10:19.500
the Weapons Intelligence Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Center, where USO materials

10:19.500 --> 10:22.900
are recovered and transferred to the CIA.

10:22.900 --> 10:27.900
Interesting connections here, seen as there are some insane CIA UAP rabbit holes, but I

10:27.900 --> 10:34.980
want to save this for a more focused video on the topic.

10:34.980 --> 10:40.740
And now we get to absolutely the most credible figure to speak on USO, who featured on Sol's

10:40.740 --> 10:48.260
November 2023 panel, Timothy Galladette, retired US Navy Rear Admiral, former assistant secretary

10:48.260 --> 10:53.140
of commerce for oceans and atmosphere within the US Department of Commerce, and former

10:53.140 --> 10:57.340
administrator of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

10:57.340 --> 11:03.060
Here I am an ocean scientist for three and a half decades, and I sit in a lot of meetings

11:03.060 --> 11:09.220
with leading ocean scientists still today, but it just it kind of mystifies me that more

11:09.220 --> 11:15.300
people are intellectually curious about what the story of the century is, and that's these,

11:15.300 --> 11:17.540
these that are occurring in the water.

11:17.540 --> 11:22.300
On a fascinating news nation interview with Ross Coltart, Galladette has made some profound

11:22.300 --> 11:23.300
statements such as,

11:23.300 --> 11:29.580
We're being visited by non-human intelligence with technology we really don't understand,

11:29.580 --> 11:32.660
and with intentions we don't understand it all either.

11:32.660 --> 11:36.860
Now that really has surprised me to hear that from a former very high ranking flag officer

11:36.860 --> 11:42.100
in the US Navy to actually say you're stating categorically that you believe NHI, non-human

11:42.100 --> 11:43.580
intelligence, are real.

11:43.580 --> 11:44.580
Absolutely.

11:44.580 --> 11:50.580
I think it's about time that we do disclose that we, we are in contact with non-human intelligence.

11:50.580 --> 11:55.380
There is so much of interest I want to cover on the Rear Admiral, such as his Sol Foundation

11:55.380 --> 12:00.960
discussion surrounding viewing the gimbal and go fast videos, but having them mysteriously

12:00.960 --> 12:03.220
removed from his inbox.

12:03.220 --> 12:09.000
Or how in his recent tweet, Galladette comments on the Sol Cal anomaly, possibly USO related

12:09.000 --> 12:11.020
being scrubbed from Google Earth.

12:11.020 --> 12:16.700
But let's focus now on his 2024 Sol published white paper, Beneath the Surface.

12:16.700 --> 12:20.520
We may learn more about UAP by looking in the ocean.

12:20.520 --> 12:25.620
This excellent paper was written by Galladette, and besides highlighting the obvious threat

12:25.620 --> 12:30.640
to maritime security, the paper frames the importance of USO's study as an unprecedented

12:30.660 --> 12:36.820
opportunity for maritime science and the subject should be elevated to national research priorities.

12:36.820 --> 12:43.940
Galladette calls for action to uncover the unknown unknowns associated with UAP and USO's

12:43.940 --> 12:49.500
due to the concerning non-reaction of the DOD regarding unidentified objects with unexplainable

12:49.500 --> 12:52.620
characteristics entering US water space.

12:52.620 --> 12:57.900
In the executive summary of the piece, the Rear Admiral makes a beautiful statement quote.

12:57.900 --> 13:04.280
Yet, however concerning the security implications of UAP are, the scientific ramifications are

13:04.280 --> 13:10.800
nothing short of world changing, pilots, credible observers, and calibrated military instrumentation

13:10.800 --> 13:16.720
have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air sea interface in ways

13:16.720 --> 13:19.720
not possible for anything made by humans.

13:19.720 --> 13:24.960
And several pieces of congressional legislation support these observations by defining UAP

13:24.960 --> 13:27.360
as trans-medium vehicles.

13:27.360 --> 13:32.420
The stunning implication is that engineering, material science, and physics beyond the state

13:32.420 --> 13:36.300
of the art are needed to produce and operate these objects.

13:36.300 --> 13:41.460
This knowledge could transform such fields as air and maritime transportation, energy

13:41.460 --> 13:48.180
generation, agriculture, communication, computing, manufacturing, space travel, virtually every

13:48.180 --> 13:52.660
imaginable economic sector, not to mention defense.

13:52.660 --> 13:57.720
Another study of UAP may lead to discoveries that make those of the scientific revolution

13:57.720 --> 14:02.120
in the 17th and 18th centuries look like baby steps.

14:02.120 --> 14:06.760
Throughout this paper, Gallaudet draws attention to the massive disparity between investigating

14:06.760 --> 14:12.140
UAP operating in our skies and UAP operating within our oceans.

14:12.140 --> 14:17.200
This is especially highlighted in the abysmal Aero Historical Report Volume 1, which makes

14:17.200 --> 14:23.820
a grand total of zero references to any cases or whistleblowers having to do with USO or

14:23.820 --> 14:26.020
maritime situations.

14:26.020 --> 14:30.460
As I mentioned in the opening statement of this video, and this is really cool to see,

14:30.460 --> 14:37.140
Gallaudet mentioned the Tic Tac case as observed in 2004 by the Navy FA-18F Super Hornets where

14:37.140 --> 14:43.100
the pilots observed the UAP hovering just above roiling ocean whitewater, possibly indicating

14:43.100 --> 14:45.580
a larger UAP below the surface.

14:45.580 --> 14:52.120
Other cases highlighted in this paper include the Trans-Medium UAP, filmed in 2013 in Aguadilla,

14:52.120 --> 14:57.640
Puerto Rico, captured by US Customs and Border Protection Thermal Imaging Systems.

14:57.640 --> 15:04.400
Quote, over three minutes the object appeared to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 mph.

15:04.400 --> 15:09.160
Enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum

15:09.160 --> 15:14.920
underwater velocity of 95 mph, and at one point split into two parts before entering

15:14.920 --> 15:16.460
the water again.

15:16.460 --> 15:21.980
The SCU authorities concluded that no known aircraft, naval vessel, projectile, or human

15:21.980 --> 15:26.140
made technology possesses these characteristics or capabilities.

15:26.140 --> 15:31.900
Gallaudet also draws from a body of literature to state that USO and Trans-Medium UAP are

15:31.900 --> 15:37.620
just as diverse as those spotted traversing the skies, quote, luminous orbs, silver and

15:37.620 --> 15:43.380
gray discs, and triangular and cigar shaped objects with various lighting conditions.

15:43.400 --> 15:48.520
First lighted craft are often seen under the sea surface without ever emerging, end quote.

15:48.520 --> 15:53.040
The paper also touches on a fascinating case I have never heard of that occurred off the

15:53.040 --> 15:59.760
coast of Shelburne Harbor, Nova Scotia in 1960, and no this isn't Shag Harbor in 1967,

15:59.760 --> 16:03.200
however the two are located extremely close.

16:03.200 --> 16:08.360
This case covers the encounters of several Royal Canadian Navy divers who participated

16:08.360 --> 16:13.420
in a US Canadian joint minesweeping exercise where the divers claimed to have observed

16:13.420 --> 16:16.980
two disc shaped craft on the seabed.

16:16.980 --> 16:22.380
Not only did the divers say they observed occupants attempting to repair one of the craft, but

16:22.380 --> 16:24.580
also recorded footage of the event.

16:24.580 --> 16:29.660
Wisely, Gallaudet thought this story pretty nonsensical or unbelievable until recent US

16:29.660 --> 16:32.100
military whistleblower revelations.

16:32.100 --> 16:35.940
I really recommend reading this whole paper, just check the show notes.

16:35.940 --> 16:39.160
The Rear Admiral wrote an excellent piece that deserves attention.

16:44.040 --> 16:48.920
After covering the sole paper, I would like to discuss just a handful of fascinating military

16:48.920 --> 16:52.280
USO cases that have caught my eye throughout history.

16:52.280 --> 16:58.680
In the same year of 2022, Lou Elizondo discussed a fascinating military USO encounter while

16:58.680 --> 17:01.440
being interviewed by astronaut Terry Virts.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.440
Check this out.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.620
I'll tell you, some of this stuff was absolutely riveting.

17:05.620 --> 17:16.740
Let's talk about the stuff, I'll share with you one interesting event that occurred.

17:16.740 --> 17:18.780
It's pretty incredible.

17:18.780 --> 17:22.980
You have, I'm not going to go into too much detail, I want people to know who it is.

17:22.980 --> 17:28.820
The person is kind of very cagey about this, but you have a helicopter going out of a Caribbean

17:28.840 --> 17:34.320
island on a regular basis because the Navy likes to test fire some of its cruise missile

17:34.320 --> 17:36.240
technology and whatnot.

17:36.240 --> 17:40.720
What will happen is that after the cruise missile runs out of fuel, it falls into the

17:40.720 --> 17:45.680
splashes into the ocean, it will sink and then at a certain time it rises up and we

17:45.680 --> 17:47.840
go and fetch it.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.240
We analyze it for telemetry and things like that.

17:51.240 --> 17:56.800
Long story short, helicopter crew goes out to recover one of these things as they are

17:56.860 --> 18:02.780
recovering it the first time, the missile, they're pulling up and something, what was

18:02.780 --> 18:09.900
described round and circular about the size of a small island, black, dark color starts

18:09.900 --> 18:11.220
rising to the surface.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.420
It doesn't break the water, but it starts rising to the surface.

18:14.420 --> 18:17.020
They thought, wow, that's really, really peculiar.

18:17.020 --> 18:22.500
Well, the next month goes around and they go out to retrieve this, another missile that

18:22.500 --> 18:24.500
was test fired.

18:24.520 --> 18:30.160
This time we've got a frogman hanging down from the rope about to latch on to the missile

18:30.160 --> 18:34.880
and this thing starts coming out of the water again and if you know about the Puerto Rican

18:34.880 --> 18:39.200
trench out there, you've talked about water that's 22,000 feet deep.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.200
It's the second deepest part of the ocean.

18:41.200 --> 18:45.600
The thing starts rising up and it's starting to come to the surface.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.640
The frogman is literally trying to climb the rope.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.560
They're doing an emergency ascent.

18:50.620 --> 18:55.420
It's absolutely panic at the disco, freaking out, what the hell is that, what's going on

18:55.420 --> 19:03.300
and as they start to pull up, it sucks the missile under water and then disappears, never

19:03.300 --> 19:05.300
to be seen again.

19:05.300 --> 19:10.060
And David Fraver's Tic Tac Encounter isn't the only time the US Navy and military has

19:10.060 --> 19:12.060
encountered these.

19:12.060 --> 19:17.940
In 2010, USN Petty Officer John Bowman saw a Tic Tac shaped object from the flight deck

19:17.940 --> 19:24.120
of the USS Carl Vinson off the coast of Haiti, quote, I was staring into the water from above

19:24.120 --> 19:30.520
when a large fat white Tic Tac object, approximately 20 feet in length, suddenly appeared in my

19:30.520 --> 19:35.920
view below me, moving right and darted into the depths as fast as it appeared.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.280
I couldn't really comprehend what I saw.

19:38.280 --> 19:42.880
It was definitely a solid object, but when it descended, it's forward and rapidly collapsed

19:42.880 --> 19:47.440
in on itself and disappeared and quote, Bowman reported this sighting to his supervising

19:47.440 --> 19:50.980
officer but was not debriefed and not to file a report.

19:50.980 --> 19:55.300
The officer told him that everybody sees weird things in the ocean.

19:55.300 --> 19:59.780
Everybody knows the famous Tic Tac sighting seen from the USS Nimitz in 2004, but did

19:59.780 --> 20:04.620
you know in 1991, the same vessel had a USO encounter?

20:04.620 --> 20:10.380
Petty Officer Kevin Thomas claimed to have seen a quote, huge black triangle, end quote,

20:10.380 --> 20:15.780
near one kilometer in length, lift out of the ocean and shoot vertically into the sky

20:15.960 --> 20:21.000
when he was left on deck after the ship was ordered to darken and clear decks.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.520
Thomas claimed to have witnessed no water dripping off the craft, nor sound made by

20:25.520 --> 20:26.800
the craft.

20:26.800 --> 20:31.840
The next day, men in civilian clothes appeared and interviewed Thomas on board the Nimitz

20:31.840 --> 20:35.680
asking why he was outside and what he saw.

20:35.680 --> 20:39.400
Thomas said not a peep due to fear of being disciplined.

20:39.400 --> 20:43.560
This story needs to be approached with some skepticism because full transparency at the

20:43.580 --> 20:47.780
moment, I am unable to uncover Thomas' service record.

20:47.780 --> 20:51.140
And here I just wanted to cover a handful of these USO cases.

20:51.140 --> 20:56.420
If for my next video, you guys would like to see me tackle solely a list of USO cases

20:56.420 --> 21:00.460
officially reported throughout Blue Book and other channels, let me know.

21:00.460 --> 21:04.180
I personally really want to make that video so if the interest is there, I will absolutely

21:04.180 --> 21:09.460
tackle it.

21:09.460 --> 21:14.480
And lastly guys, I just wanted to cover a series of very controversial images taken

21:14.480 --> 21:18.680
in March of 1971 from the USS Trepang.

21:18.680 --> 21:25.000
These images purport to show the vessels encounter with at least two forms of UAP slash USOs,

21:25.000 --> 21:28.240
a triangle and cigar shaped craft.

21:28.240 --> 21:33.520
Debate has circled endlessly since these photos first appeared, some arguing they are legitimate,

21:33.520 --> 21:37.720
some arguing their hoaxes, and some arguing the images are real but depict engagement

21:37.780 --> 21:40.020
with test barrage balloons.

21:40.020 --> 21:43.740
And I do have to add there are some people who think all or some of these photos are

21:43.740 --> 21:49.140
an example of Feta Morgana, a complex mirage appearing above the horizon.

21:49.140 --> 21:54.180
The story goes these images first appeared in a French magazine called Top Secret.

21:54.180 --> 21:58.700
The original scans of the images were sent to investigator Alex Mistretta.

21:58.700 --> 22:05.420
Allegedly, the Trepang station between Iceland and Jan Mayen Island in March of 1971, led

22:05.440 --> 22:10.720
by Admiral Dean Reynolds Sackett, happened upon the USOs by accident.

22:10.720 --> 22:15.760
Officer John Clica initially spotted the objects with the onboard periscope.

22:15.760 --> 22:20.680
Some of these images seem to be harmless snapshots of the objects hovering, entering, or leaving

22:20.680 --> 22:25.760
the water, while others appear to show the objects in distress, unknown if this was due

22:25.760 --> 22:28.200
to engagement with the Trepang.

22:28.200 --> 22:33.480
Well we can actually confirm that the USS Trepang was indeed in the Arctic at this time,

22:33.540 --> 22:39.340
especially near Blue Nose Arctic Circle during November of 1971, and we can confirm this

22:39.340 --> 22:41.620
was the only vessel in the region.

22:41.620 --> 22:47.260
I cannot find any information on if attack submarines carry balloons for training exercises,

22:47.260 --> 22:52.660
solely this joint USN CIA document on testing balloon launches from submarines that was

22:52.660 --> 22:58.260
conducted in 1955, so this does cast doubt on the balloon training exercise theory for

22:58.260 --> 23:03.300
me, especially due to the fact there are no live fire records by the submarine at this

23:04.120 --> 23:05.120
time.

23:05.120 --> 23:10.280
Investigator and Navy pilot Steve Murillo was able to speak to Admiral Sackett.

23:10.280 --> 23:14.520
Admiral Sackett was gracious enough to take multiple phone calls, but steered away from

23:14.520 --> 23:16.320
the UFO question.

23:16.320 --> 23:21.160
The Admiral stated he did not see anything unusual on board the Trepang, nor did anyone

23:21.160 --> 23:22.160
else.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.860
He only, quote, saw ice.

23:24.860 --> 23:29.600
The alleged spotter from the periscope, John Clica, whose identity we can also confirm,

23:29.600 --> 23:31.560
was also contacted.

23:31.560 --> 23:37.020
He stated he found the investigation interesting, and did not know what the pictures represented.

23:37.020 --> 23:41.100
So these two statements essentially kill the training range story for me.

23:41.100 --> 23:46.740
We are left with likely a hoax or the real deal, but the Admiral and Clica either cannot

23:46.740 --> 23:50.380
break security oaths or were unaware of these signatures.

23:50.380 --> 23:55.380
Unfortunately, one of the best images of the lot shows signs of tampering, credit to Wim

23:55.380 --> 23:57.700
Van Utrecht for this discovery.

23:57.700 --> 24:01.440
To my knowledge, this is the only such example of photo tampering.

24:01.440 --> 24:05.640
Though he is extremely skeptical on these images, I tend to agree with the thesis of

24:05.640 --> 24:11.520
John Greenwald here, that this altered image does not discredit the validity of the other

24:11.520 --> 24:12.520
images.

24:12.520 --> 24:16.400
John states many publications will enhance photographs for print.

24:16.400 --> 24:21.160
This is done to improve visual appeal, and since the original images does indeed differ

24:21.160 --> 24:27.160
somewhat in aspect from the magazine image, I find this hypothesis to be pretty plausible.

24:27.160 --> 24:32.620
So are these images of the triangle, cigar, and possibly an egg-shaped UAP interacting

24:32.620 --> 24:35.460
with our oceans real or a hoax?

24:35.460 --> 24:40.140
Personally, I'm undecided, I need to do more investigation into this case, but the

24:40.140 --> 24:42.980
images are perplexing to say the least.

24:42.980 --> 24:46.460
Hey guys, thank you so much for joining me today as we took this dive into the history

24:46.460 --> 24:49.460
and fascinating aspects of USO.

24:49.460 --> 24:56.380
In my opinion, throughout history USO have been severely overlooked until 2022 and onward.

24:56.380 --> 25:00.720
Thank you Timothy Gallaudet, one of the biggest inspirations for this video.

25:00.720 --> 25:07.600
I find that I've never ever ever anywhere seen the history of USO study covered.

25:07.600 --> 25:12.500
Now here at my channel, and probably many other channels too, we go in depth into Project

25:12.500 --> 25:16.760
Blue Book, The Robertson Panel, The Condon Report, all of these aspects throughout history

25:16.760 --> 25:21.680
of UFO being studied openly or secretly, but you never hear about USOs.

25:21.680 --> 25:25.880
So I just really wanted to touch on this fascinating aspect of the phenomenon.

25:25.880 --> 25:33.020
And if you guys want, I really want to make that kind of video on some famous and underrepresented

25:33.020 --> 25:34.020
USO cases.

25:34.020 --> 25:38.180
I want to pull directly from Blue Book and Grudge and Sine and look from there, find some

25:38.180 --> 25:39.180
credible reports.

25:39.180 --> 25:40.660
That's a video that really excites me.

25:40.660 --> 25:44.420
So if you guys want to see that, let me know in the comments below.

25:44.420 --> 25:48.420
Please remember to like and subscribe and if you think about it, join the Patreon, I'm

25:48.420 --> 25:52.780
not going to gatekeep any of my content, only pay for what you think the content is worth.

25:53.440 --> 25:57.680
And for those of you who are into the sport, how about that 300 card guys?

25:57.680 --> 26:02.360
That Holloway Gachie finish was one of the most wild things I've ever seen.

26:02.360 --> 26:05.400
I'm happy my boy Yuri Prohaska got the win.

26:05.400 --> 26:09.640
And choosing Jamal Hill aged like a gross cheese.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.800
So that didn't end up too well.

26:11.800 --> 26:12.800
Hope him the best.

26:12.800 --> 26:13.800
He's a great fighter.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.160
But let me know what you guys think about this next video and some other video ideas

26:17.160 --> 26:18.640
you guys want to see.

26:18.900 --> 26:22.020
I'm recording this the day after the Kona Blue files came out.

26:22.020 --> 26:25.100
So I will definitely be taking a look at those and reporting back to you guys.

26:25.100 --> 26:28.020
So thank you so much and I'll catch everybody next time.
