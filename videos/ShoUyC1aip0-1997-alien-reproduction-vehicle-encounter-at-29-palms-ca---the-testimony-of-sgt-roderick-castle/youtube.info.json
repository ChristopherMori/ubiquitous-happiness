    "description": "Exploring the witness testimony of USMC Sgt Roderick Castle and his harrowing experience during the USMC Hunter Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment in Southern California from 02-14 March 1997. While Castle and his fellow VMA-513 Marines were performing overnight AV-8B Harrier crash retrieval duties, the men were sent to investigate \"unidentified flare activity\".\n\nWhen rounding a hill near Emerson Dry Lake, the marines encountered an enormous, 200-300 foot, equilateral black triangular craft hovering only 150-200 feet off the ground. Below the triangle, solely 150-200 feet from Castle and the VMA-513 marines, stood a retainer of 30 men and 5-6 tactical vehicles.\n\nThe men were outfitted in all black gear and heavily armed with no insignia, name tags, identifiable markings, etc. As soon as the USMC Marines encountered the craft and team in their Humvee, half of the retainer of Black Operators quickly swarmed and detained the Marines at gunpoint, barking orders at the soldiers to keep their heads down under threats of death.\n\nWhile being detained, Castle observed the triangle dart off towards the Northwest at incomprehensible speeds.... The Triangle featured no visible signs of propulsion and gave off no sounds or identifiable thrust or heat signatures. \n\nCastle reached out to David Grusch in early 2025, prepared to swear his testimony in before Congress.\n\nThis project seeks to analyze the who, what, when, where, and why of Castle's encounter and analyze why this incredible, logic-defying triangle is indeed an Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV).\n\nSupport me on Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/c/UAPGerb \nFollow me on Twitter: https://x.com/UAPGERB\n\nPrevious Work Referenced:\n- The 1948 Aztec, New Mexico UFO Crash Retrieval: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJxbyu-9Tj0&t=8378s\n- \nUFO Legacy Programs - Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p99lTsC7wQ&t=7673s\n- \n1997 Peru UFO Crash Retrieval - the Story of Jonathan Weygandt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jc2G5aEH0A&t=6915s\n- \nUS Navy UFO Crash Retrieval & Reverse Engineering Programs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GSqOEvoBE\n- UAP Reverse Engineering at Edwards Air Force Base [Redacted List Vol.2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LSMLGBDNg&t=22s\n-  \nAlien Reproduction Vehicle - TR-3B and the Flying Triangles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7JP0uX0GwY&t=113s\n- Alien Reproduction Vehicle - the Testimony of Mark McCandlish: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF07QMm6joE&t=56s\n- \nMichael Herrera - Insights into UAP Encounter and Black Program Insiders: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EMO38JUfVE&t=1368s\n\nUAP GERB ACRONYM LIST: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riL6jgIKqCWmHW7AdZZEb9qlAAjyrBVY/view?usp=sharing\n\n0:00 INTRO\n10:43 R.J.
