0	6360	What's up guys? It is Gerb. Welcome back to the channel. Join me today as we start a
6360	13080	six-part series into the Alien and UFO Obscure Oddities Iceberg, posted to Reddit by user
13080	18360	BlikeSama. Now, for those of you who don't know what an iceberg is, an iceberg is a way
18360	23560	of categorizing the most known to least known components of an overall topic or theme. So
23560	29440	think of an iceberg in real life how the iceberg you see above the surface is only scratching
29520	34760	the surface of the entirety of the iceberg below the waters. So we have six layers to
34760	39760	this iceberg. As we start with the first layers, we're going to have some pretty well known
39760	44520	subjects, stuff you might have heard of as we get deeper into level five, six, we're
44520	49000	going to get into more fringe theories and some stuff I might not have heard of. So it
49000	54160	should be a learning process for all of us. I'd like to disclaim that I did not make
54160	59000	this iceberg, so I do not have control over the entries within it. On this channel, I
59040	64440	like to keep things as factual as I know them to the UFO UAP phenomena. So if there's something
64440	68560	that's rather bogus or absolutely absurd, I'm going to say so. And if there's something
68560	74520	I strongly agree with, I'm also going to say so. So let's get this started. But before
74520	80000	we kick it off, please consider liking and subscribing. I really like making these videos.
80000	84480	So the more support I get, the more of an urge I have to make some quality content and
84480	88200	some good documentaries. If you haven't seen it yet, check out my first video with the
88200	93040	documentary on the Wilson Davis Memo. It's not bad, could be better, and it will be better.
93040	101000	So stick around. Let's get started, guys. Layer one. We'll call this the Observered
101000	110480	Layer. Extraterrestrial life simply refers to any life that does not originate from
110480	117520	Earth. From a single celled organism to a highly advanced civilization that can traverse
117600	123480	the stars in a matter of hours or days, these all classify as extraterrestrial life. So
123480	129640	not the most challenging concept to understand, but this first entry just boils down to any
129640	138200	life, carbon, or otherwise, silicon, that does not originate from Earth.
138200	144560	Crop circles are a phenomena in which large-scale structures are created into a field, generally
144600	149840	a wheat field. These structures are often pretty interesting and beautiful due to their
149840	155440	symmetry or geometric designs. And because of the complexity of the designs, a lot of
155440	161880	people like to attribute crop circles to paranormal or extraterrestrial phenomena.
161880	167800	Widely considered hoaxes, the craze of crop circles began in 1991, where two pranksters,
167800	173680	Doug Bauer and Dave Chorley, took credit for making the initial wave of crop circles with
173680	180640	planks of wood, rope, and baseball caps. Many of the seemingly bizarre creation tactics
180640	186800	of crop circles can be explained away by skeptics, including tie an end of a rope to an anchor
186800	192240	point on the other end to a board, which is used to crush or flatten plants. There's
192240	199400	also a method to bend crops after a recent rain that was discovered in Hungary in 1992.
199400	205200	The point is, while crop circles are beautiful and interesting and have wonderful designs,
205200	210200	I think it's likely, extremely likely, these are human-made and, in my opinion, not very
210200	215560	interesting, so I'm not going to spend more time on it.
215560	221360	The McMinnville UFO Photographs are some of the most famous photographs of a UFO ever
221360	229240	taken. On May 11, 1950, farmers Paul and Evelyn Trent saw something inexplicable near their
229280	236600	farmhouse in McMinnville, Oregon. When walking back to her farmhouse, Evelyn noticed a slow-moving
236600	242280	metallic disc-shaped object heading in her direction from the northeast. After gilling
242280	247920	for her husband, Paul came outside, also seeing the object. He grabbed his camera and was
247920	253800	able to take two photographs of the metallic disc near his home.
253800	259200	Due to the popularity of these photographs, the negatives were loaned to William H. Hartman,
259200	265280	an astronomer on the Condon Committee in 1967. The objective of the Condon Committee outside
265280	272000	of the University of Colorado Boulder was to investigate UFOs and was a government-funded
272000	277000	UFO research project. I'd like to do another video on the Condon Committee because the
277000	282600	program was basically told to explain UFOs away as swamp gas and weather balloons, but
282600	288720	Hartman found some extremely interesting oddities with these photographs. Hartman was impressed
288760	292880	with the images, noting that the brightness of the underside of the craft appeared to be
292880	297920	lighter than the underside of the oil tank also seen in the images. He said this was
297920	303160	possibly due to atmospheric extinction, the same effect that makes distant mountains
303160	309920	appear washed out and blue in images. This effect suggested that the object was further
309920	315240	from the camera than the tank, not a small, local object hanging from a string like some
315280	321640	debunkers like to claim. He wrote to the Condon Committee that, quote, this is one of the
321640	328320	few UFO reports in which all factors investigated, geometric, psychological, and physical appear
328320	334520	to be consistent with the assertion that an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic,
334520	341040	disc-shaped, tens of meters in diameter and evidently artificial flew within sight of
341080	349080	two witnesses. Perhaps we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this
349080	358080	common bound. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we
358080	367080	were facing an alien threat from outside this world. Alien invasion simply refers to a
367080	375520	worldwide invasion by an extraterrestrial species. Now, I like to think that an invasion
375520	380960	by an extraterrestrial species is pretty unlikely. It's impossible, of course, to attribute
380960	387520	human motives to a non-human intelligence, but if extraterrestrials have the ability
387520	396800	to traverse the cosmos and warp spacetime, it seems rather idiotic that such an advanced
396880	405080	species would be warmongering like we are. In my opinion, humans would be more interesting
405080	411640	to study from a distance. A hairless primate that has recently discovered how to harness
411640	418880	nuclear technology and is at the foot of exploring our solar system or destroying ourselves.
418880	424840	It's a pretty interesting place in which our species is residing. Perhaps this is something
424920	430520	like the great filter that the Fermi Paradox talks about, but alien invasion, scary, but
430520	439040	likely, in my opinion, no. Panspermia is a theory that life exists throughout the entirety
439040	445800	of the universe in microbial or cellular form and is distributed by space dust, meteors,
445800	453320	asteroid comets, and planetoids. Let's tackle this with an example. One possible origin
453320	461240	of life here on Earth is a result of panspermia. Millions and millions of years ago, Mars had
461240	467280	life, whether this was single cellular or multicellular, we don't know. But if panspermia
467280	473120	occurred, that means an asteroid or a meteor or something large impacted Mars' surface.
473120	479160	This kicked up much Martian soil and dust containing microbes. That dust and particles
479160	483760	then made their way over to Earth, where the seeds of life were carried from one planet
483760	491200	to another. There are three types of panspermia, lithopanspermia, which means life being carried
491200	497080	from one solar system to another, ballistic panspermia, which is life carried from one
497080	503840	planet to another within the same solar system, and directed panspermia. This would be human
503840	511600	sending life to other planets, essentially. The Men in Black are a shadowy organization
511600	519280	featured prominently in Ufology and UFO folklore. Essentially, the Men in Black are suit clad
519280	526520	government agents who are used to question, interrogate, threaten, harass, and sometimes
526520	533240	assassinate, experiencers of UFOs and extraterrestrials.
533240	540800	The legend of the Men in Black can be traced back to June 27, 1947. Harold Dahl was on
540800	545400	a conservation mission on the Puget Sound near the eastern shore of Washington's Mowry
545400	550760	Island. I believe he was gathering logs or just doing some outdoor work when he saw six
550760	557000	donut-shaped obstacles hovering about half a mile above his boat. Some debris fell from
557000	563040	the obstacles, a piece of which struck and killed his dog. Dahl was able to take pictures
563040	569280	of the craft and record some footage. The following day, Dahl was visited by a man in
569280	575760	a black suit. The two had to a local diner where the man was able to recount in extreme
575760	581640	detail what Dahl had witnessed the night before. The man said, quote, what I have said to
581640	586320	you is proof to you that I know a great deal more about this experience of yours than you
586320	592680	will want to believe. Dahl was then told not to speak of the incident. If he did, bad things
592680	599400	would happen. As a final statement on the Men in Black, I'd like to say that these
599400	604400	guys don't always need to be in suits, okay? What you could consider the Men in Black,
604400	610160	people opposing any sort of discussion or sharing of information or footage of UFOs could
610160	615160	also just be described as men in military fatigues. This is what happened during the
615160	620960	Roswell incident with Jesse Marcell and the girl whose fireman father witnessed the crash
620960	627680	craft as well as Lieutenant Robert Jacobs in his footage of a UFO disabling a nuclear
627680	632960	warhead. So the men can be in suits. That dives a little bit more into the paranormal
632960	638640	and weird things or just men in military fatigues blocking any sort of conversation or spreading
638640	644840	of information. I would like to mention I think these suit clad men in black are a total
644840	653400	hoax and distract from the actual validity of people within the United States government
653400	659280	and high ranking officials trying to stop the spread of legitimate UFO sightings and
659280	668040	footage. So I am not a fan of the suit clad men in black. I think it's a little bit ridiculous.
668040	673480	The Nazca lines. If you have seen ancient aliens on the history channel, I'm willing
673480	680800	to bet you have heard of the Nazca lines. If not, no worries. I got you. The Nazca lines
680800	686520	are a group of geoglyphs made in the soil of the Nazca desert near southern Peru. It's
686520	693960	estimated that most of these pictures depicting animals were created between 500 BC and 500
693960	700440	AD. These large geoglyphs were made by making depressions or shallow incisions in the desert
700440	707600	floor, removing stones and pebbles, and leaving different colored dirt to be exposed. Now
707600	712960	seen from the ground, the Nazca lines appear as nothing more than lines. But when viewed
712960	718520	from an aerial position, the Nazca lines then start to depict the beautiful creatures
718520	723920	that they're made to represent. While it's highly likely that the Nazca lines were used
723920	729440	for ancient religious purposes, such as offerings to gods who would be able to see the lines
729440	736480	from the heavens or other varying rituals, author Eric Von Daniken in his book Chariots
737480	745400	1968 proposed that the Nazca lines were in fact used as landing sites for UFOs. He theorized
745400	751200	that the shapes and lines were made by extraterrestrials and were created to help steer their spaceships
751200	756480	to land safely. Von Daniken claimed the patterns at the site looked very similar to modern
756480	763040	airport designs and used this as pieces of evidence to prove that extraterrestrials
763120	769760	used this Nazca plane as a landing space for their spacecraft. I of course favor the prosaic
769760	775200	explanation here. I think the Nazca lines were likely used for religious purposes and are also
775200	780800	observable from nearby hills and mountains, not just from the air, from airplanes or spacecraft.
781440	786560	But it is fun to think about the ancient astronaut theory, I mean that's why ancient aliens has
786560	795840	like 30 seasons. The Betty and Barney Hill Incident is one of the most famous alien abduction
795840	806000	stories in US history. Their story begins at around 1030 on September 19th 1961. The couple
806000	811840	was driving back from a vacation near Niagara Falls in Montreal just south of Lancaster, New
811840	819360	Hampshire. Upon driving, Betty observed a bright point of light in the sky that moved just below
819360	825840	the moon and the planet Jupiter. Betty noticed the light moved erratically and grew bigger and
825840	832000	brighter at various times, and Betty urged Barney to stop the car so the two could take a closer
832000	838400	look. Through binoculars, Betty noticed an odd shaped craft travel across the face of the moon
838400	844800	with flashing multicolored lights. Initially, Barney thought this may have been a commercial
844800	851600	airliner, but as the craft turned towards him and started rapidly descending, he quickly changed his
851600	859440	mind. The couple then continued driving, observing the well illuminated craft moving erratically
859440	865360	back and forth in the night sky. The object rapidly descended toward the hill's vehicle,
865440	870400	causing Barney to stop the car in the middle of the highway. The silent craft hovered about
870400	878240	80 to 100 feet above them, reminding Barney of a large pancake. Barney then claimed to have seen
878240	884080	8 to 11 humanoid figures who were all peering out of the craft's windows looking at him.
884880	889760	All but one figure then retreated back into the craft. The one remaining figure
890560	894000	communicated with Barney telepathically, giving him a message saying,
894000	900560	quote, Stay where you are and keep looking, end quote. Now it's worth mentioning that later on
900560	906320	when Barney reported this abduction to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena,
906320	914960	NICAP, he explicitly stated, quote, Beans were somehow not human. Red lights then began to
915040	920240	telescope out of the sides of the craft and a long structure descended from the bottom of the
920240	928320	craft, approaching Barney. The couple then arrived home, perplexed, noticing that their memories
928320	936160	became incomplete and fragmented after observing the craft buzzing towards them. About 10 days
936160	943120	after the incident, Betty began having strange vivid dreams for five successive nights. Within
943120	950080	these dreams, she was escorted by small humanoids five to five feet four inches tall with Barney
950080	957920	walking behind her. She recalls after being walked with the humanoids being set back by her car,
957920	964400	where the leader suggests they wait for the craft's departure. The hills then sought hypnosis to
964400	970240	explain their missing time after their encounter. Seen as their 178 mile drive home from their
970240	976400	vacation should have taken about four hours, but their drive took seven, meaning there were three
976400	982880	hours of missing time where they could not explain what happened. Barney's first session of hypnosis
982880	990880	is extremely disturbing. He recalls running from the UFO back to his car. He recalls driving away
990880	996960	from the UFO, but felt an irresistible urge to pull off the road and drive into the woods.
997920	1004560	Upon doing so, he cited six figures standing on the dirt road. He described these figures
1004560	1010800	very similar to what occurred in Betty's dreams. Barney said the beans stared into his eyes with
1010800	1020480	a terrifying effect. Barney said, quote, Oh, those eyes, they're in my brain. And, quote, I was told
1020480	1025920	to close my eyes because I saw two eyes coming close to mind. And I felt like the eyes had pushed
1025920	1033120	into my eyes, end quote. And finally, quote, All I see are these eyes. I'm not even afraid that
1033120	1037840	they're not connected to a body. They're just there. They're just up close to me, pressing
1037840	1045360	against my eyes, end quote. Betty's recollections from hypnosis were remarkably similar to Barney's.
1046240	1052560	In her hypnosis session, she recalls being aboard the craft, talking about the technology she saw
1052560	1059040	and a star map she observed within what she guessed was the craft's control room. Now,
1059040	1065120	this star map is pretty controversial, as some interpretations show it bearing soul, our sun,
1065120	1070480	as well as the creatures coming from the Zeta reticuli system. And there has been a back and
1070480	1076880	forth into this star maps authenticity, including a rebuttal by Carl Sagan in the 1980s cosmos.
1076880	1082080	But even members on the Condon UFO report, as mentioned earlier, said the odds of this being
1082080	1089200	a random configuration of stars were quote, at least 1000 to one against, end quote. There's a
1089200	1093840	lot more to the Betty and Barney Hill incident, a lot more to study and a lot more to talk about.
1093840	1097760	I can't give it justice in this couple minute segment, but that's a brief overview.
1099920	1106480	Rawleism is a UFO religion dating back to the 70s in France, founded by Claude Vorihon.
1107440	1113200	The religion teaches that an extraterrestrial species known as the Elohim created humanity
1113200	1119440	using their advanced technology. Now, key historical and religious figures such as Buddha, Jesus,
1119440	1125440	and Muhammad have been mistaken for gods throughout history, even though they were just Elohim.
1126080	1132240	The Elohim created 40 human Elohim hybrids who have served as prophets throughout the history
1132560	1139120	of humanity. The religion believes that since the bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, humanity has entered
1139120	1145600	an age of apocalypse and will destroy itself with nuclear annihilation unless it finds a way to
1145600	1152960	peacefully harness these technological developments. Because of this upcoming apocalypse, the Rawleians
1152960	1158080	have sought to build an embassy for the Elohim that incorporates a landing pad for their spaceship.
1159040	1164480	This religion slash cult isn't harming anybody, so it's kind of fun to read about,
1164480	1170320	and it's not as dangerous as some other UFO death cult. So yeah, fun little read.
1173120	1179040	The Kardashev Scale is a fascinating method of measuring the civilization's level of technological
1179040	1184240	advancement based on the amount of energy the civilization is capable of harnessing.
1185200	1191520	The Kardashev Scale was first proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964.
1193040	1196640	There are traditionally three types of Kardashev civilizations.
1197360	1202960	Type one, a planetary civilization, is able to harness all available energy from their
1202960	1209040	planetary system. This gives the civilization control over the entire planet's natural forces,
1209120	1215840	including weather and other various phenomena. A type two is a stellar civilization, a civilization
1215840	1221840	that is able to harness all available energy from their host, star. This is done through
1221840	1227280	hypothetical methods such as a Dyson Sphere, which we'll touch on later. And the type two
1227280	1233600	civilization is able to occupy other planets and other moons within their system. Finally,
1233600	1240000	a type three civilization is known as a galactic civilization. A galactic civilization is able to
1240000	1246880	control energy on the scale of their entire host galaxy. Type three civilizations are able to travel
1246880	1255520	across, stars to stars, and colonize their entire home galaxy. Now the Kardashev Scale increases
1255520	1261280	to a Kardashev four and a Kardashev five, in which a civilization is able to control the total
1261280	1268480	energy output of a galactic cluster, and a type five where the civilization can control the energy
1268480	1274560	output of an entire universe, but we don't know if that's theoretically possible. You may ask
1274560	1281680	yourself where does Earth and humans fall on the Kardashev Scale? We are currently about a 0.7
1282400	1290480	rating on the Kardashev Scale. The Phoenix Lights refers to a mass UFO sighting in a boomerang or
1290480	1299520	V formation over Phoenix, Arizona in March 13 1997, and persists as one of the largest and most
1299520	1307280	perplexing mass sightings of a UFO in US history. The sightings of hundreds of people are often
1307280	1313120	explained away by the official narrative that these sightings was due to flares and flying
1313200	1320480	formations of A-10 Thunderbolt 2 aircrafts. But the governor of Arizona himself,
1320480	1326160	Fife Simen, observed the event and attempted to make an official inquiry, but was denied.
1326160	1332160	He's quoted as saying, quote, I'm a pilot, and I know just about every machine that flies.
1332160	1337760	It was bigger than anything I've ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it,
1337760	1345680	responsible people. In 2017, Simington also wrote an editorial piece for CNN which he further
1345680	1351040	discussed his experience with the Phoenix Lights. He said he observed a large delta-shaped craft
1351040	1355920	which moved silently in the sky. He said it was dramatically large with, quote,
1355920	1362240	very distinctive leading edge with some enormous lights, end quote. He expressed his dissatisfaction
1362240	1370400	in the Air Force's official explanation of test flares and claimed he did in fact see a large craft.
1372080	1378720	The truth here, I'm not sure. The flare explanation can be valid for some sightings such as Jeremy
1378720	1385280	Corbell's Palm Spring UFO footage in 2023. But due to the witness testimony of hundreds of people,
1385280	1391200	including the governor of Arizona himself, I'm not sure we can rule out the possibility a strange
1391280	1394960	and anomalous craft flew over the city of Phoenix, Arizona.
1397440	1402960	The Battle of Los Angeles is a famous event that occurred in the city of Los Angeles, California,
1402960	1411200	on late February the 24th of 1942. Fresh off of the attack on Pearl Harbor and entry into World War
1411200	1417120	II, the U.S.'s war nerves were at a relative all-time high, expecting any time an attack from
1417120	1423280	Japan on the western coast. Over a number of hours, multiple radar signatures were detected,
1423280	1429600	sending the local military into a scramble. An impending threat of attack by the Japanese was
1429600	1436160	expected, prompting an aerial bombardment. One quote from the scene says, quote,
1436160	1442880	the air erupted like a volcano, end quote. Five civilians died in the aerial bombardment,
1442880	1449520	three from car accidents, two from heart attacks. But later on, it was determined that the reasoning
1449520	1457680	behind the aerial bombardment was war nerves or a meteorological balloon. A photo was then published
1457680	1465920	in the LA Times on February 26th of 1942. The photo show searched lights focused on what looks to be
1466000	1473840	a saucer-type spacecraft. However, it's controversial that this photo may have been altered,
1473840	1479600	heavily altered, and thus might not be an actual representation of what exactly the search lights
1479600	1485520	and artillery cannons were shooting at. But this is an interesting story. The Battle of Los Angeles
1485520	1491600	is actually one of the cases that got me into the study of UFOs as a young kid. Nowadays, I don't
1491600	1496560	think it's that interesting. I think that there's probably a likely prosaic explanation here, but
1497360	1501680	I have a lot of nostalgia for this case. But interesting nonetheless.
1505440	1512160	The reptilian theory is a conspiracy theory that was proposed by David Ike. Essentially,
1512160	1519840	the reptilian theory talks of a shape-shifting reptilian race of aliens that is evil and slowly
1519840	1527200	taking control of Earth by taking on human form and gaining political or social power to manipulate
1527200	1536480	human entities. First introduced in 1999 in Ike's book The Big Secret, reptilians are tall, blood
1536480	1543040	drinking, shape-shifting reptilian humanoids from the Alpha Draconi star system hiding in
1543040	1548960	underground bases and in plain sight. These reptiles have a conspiracy against humanity,
1548960	1554880	whether that means to take over the world, subjugate humanity, or whatever. I'm not quite
1554880	1561760	sure, but numerous people including the Rothschilds, Bush, and British royal family are reptiles,
1561760	1569360	according to Ike. There are up to six. The reptilian theory has become one of the world's most popular
1569360	1574240	conspiracy theories, with many internet users trying to find videos of political leaders
1574240	1580240	that have discrepancies in their eyes or lizard eyes, as well as a lot of public places leaning
1580240	1584800	into the conspiracy. For example, I live in Denver, and the Denver International Airport,
1584800	1589200	which has been shrouded in conspiracy, has really leaned into the whole reptilian thing with a lot
1589200	1599040	of posters of reptiles and such. The Pentagon UFO videos finally were eaten. The Pentagon UFO videos
1599040	1605920	refer to a series of three videos taken by the DoD, Air Force, or military regarding UFOs that
1605920	1611920	were classified, but released due to the efforts of Llewella Zondo and Chris Mellon, and published
1611920	1618800	via The New York Times with Leslie Keane and Ralph Blumenthal. These three videos show anomalous
1618800	1625040	craft taken on FLIR footage, labeled Go Fast, Gimbal, and FLIR.
1632240	1638400	I'd like to focus on the Gimbal video as shown here, which was taken in 2015 off the coast of
1638400	1645040	Florida. A targeting pod on an F-A-18 captured this anomalous object, which the pilot said was
1645040	1652320	able to move with no visible propulsion method and stand stationary in severe winds.
1653680	1658400	Now, unfortunately, there's a clip in part of this video that has not been declassified,
1659040	1664160	and this is confirmed by the pilots who recorded this video, as well as Christopher Mellon. But
1664160	1670400	within the rest of the video, this craft rendezvous with a series of other crafts and takes a V
1670400	1676640	formation. That's extremely strange, and I would give anything to be able to see that footage, but
1677760	1685760	clown debunkers like Mick West like to claim that the Gimbal video is a bird, or a jet moving
1685760	1692560	away from the F-A-18, and thus is a lens artifact on the FLIR footage. I like to trust the eyes of
1692560	1698320	the trained pilots who have recorded these videos, not some dude who sits in his basement and tries
1698320	1704640	to debunk every single thing that ever exists on UFOs. So, very curious video. I love this. This
1704640	1713920	is a classic. All three are classics. Area 51. Now, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on Area 51,
1713920	1720400	because I know all of you have heard of it, and I'd like to make a video itself on Area 51, but
1721120	1727600	we'll give a summary. Area 51 is the common name for a highly classified U.S. Air Force base
1727600	1736320	in the Nevada desert, near Groom Lake and former nuclear test ranges. For decades, Area 51 went
1736320	1743280	unacknowledged and was associated with conspiracies of UFOs and experimental aircrafts. In fact,
1743280	1750640	Area 51 wasn't officially acknowledged until 2013, where the CIA publicly acknowledged the base
1750640	1757200	through a Freedom of Information Act request. Many believe that Area 51 isn't just home to
1757200	1762800	experimental aircraft tests like the U-2 tests and reverse engineering foreign adversaries like
1762800	1769760	the MiG jets, but is also housed for reverse engineering and test flights of UFOs. While I
1769760	1775280	don't really want to cover that on this video, I will leave you with this. Pictured on screen is a
1775280	1783520	project patch from Area 51, supplied by Eric Tabor. Eric Tabor is an official UFO whistleblower who
1783520	1790800	submitted a memorandum for record to Arrow, the all-domain anomaly resolution office, that this
1790800	1796480	patch belonged to his great uncle, Sam Yerkuhart. I'm not sure how to pronounce his name, it's a
1796480	1803200	little tough to spell. But his great uncle divulged to him that while working at Area 51 as a contractor,
1803200	1809920	he was privy to learn that the base housed an egg-shaped UFO that was found intact in the
1809920	1815840	Nevada desert. It's worth noting that Sam was the head of security for an engineering group,
1815840	1821440	the radar cross-section training team, so it's not wild to think he was privy to some strange
1821440	1827760	information. True or not, this is extremely interesting as Tabor has submitted a legal document
1827760	1837040	to Arrow testifying that this is, in fact, true. So maybe Area 51 has housed UFOs. But we'll save
1837120	1845520	that for another time. The Nordic aliens are a supposed race of extraterrestrial humanoids
1845520	1852720	who come from the Pallades system and resemble Nordic Scandinavians. The Nordics are often
1852720	1859840	taller than regular humans, six to seven feet tall, have blue eyes, fair skin, and long blonde hair.
1860800	1867760	Throughout the 1950s, many people alleged to have encounters with the Nordic aliens claiming they
1867760	1875040	were benevolent and magical, often caring about humans and the world's prosperity. The Nordics
1875040	1883280	were able to communicate with humans via telepathy and possessed a cool calming demeanor that proved
1883280	1891920	to be youthful, affectionate, and kind. The Nordic aliens are part of a galactic federation
1892560	1896720	and traverse the cosmos from their spherical to cigar shaped crafts.
1898480	1903360	Interestingly enough, if you've heard of the abduction case of Travis Walton, a film was made
1903360	1908320	about him called Fire in the Sky, I'd recommend checking it out. But Travis Walton has a very
1908320	1914640	curious abduction story that has a lot of intriguing aspects to it, let's just say that.
1915200	1921520	And from his testimony, when he's taken aboard a UFO craft, he encounters several types of beings,
1921520	1926960	such as the common graze, including a Nordic like race of tall humanoids.
1928080	1935680	Are the Nordic aliens real? I don't know. I don't like to focus too much on abduction stories or
1936320	1942400	extraterrestrial races. I just like to focus on the fact there is something in our sky that's of
1942400	1947280	non human intelligence or multiple things in the sky of non human intelligence and start there.
1947280	1951760	We got a lot to work through before we start deciphering what exactly these things are if
1951760	1960240	they're even extraterrestrials. The graze are the archetypal extraterrestrial and most famous
1960240	1968160	depiction of extraterrestrials ever. Often just referred to as graze, graze are typically gray
1968160	1975120	skinned, small humanoid beings between three and five feet tall, completely hairless,
1975120	1982240	with enlarged heads, sometimes a small slit like mouth, sometimes no mouth, sometimes just nostrils,
1982240	1991440	sometimes no nostrils, and large black piercing eyes. The graze often lack muscular definition
1991440	1998240	and have a visible skeletal structure. I want to stress with their head size, their head is usually
1998240	2007200	comically larger than their body. Now the gray can possibly be traced all the way back to 1917,
2007200	2013680	where occultist Aleister Crowley performed a black magic ritual and was able to contact a
2013680	2022080	bean named Lamb across space and dimensions. But I like to look at the fact the graze really became
2022080	2029600	popular in the 1947 Roswell crash. These were the supposed beans that were found dead or dying by
2029600	2034720	their crashed craft a little bit northwest of Roswell, New Mexico. I'd like to make a long
2034720	2040720	video on Roswell because it's fascinating, but also remember Betty and Barney Hill. These small
2040720	2046720	humanoid beings match the depiction of graze as well. In fact, graze are so commonly involved with
2046720	2052720	alien abductions. Graze make up about 50% of claimed abductions or sightings in Australia,
2053360	2060000	73% in the US, 48% in continental Europe, and 12% around the UK.
2060160	2066640	There are many interesting theories about what exactly the gray is, some of them being the
2066640	2072640	graze are basically biological drones utilized by other extraterrestrial civilizations.
2072640	2078960	Graze are often described as emotionless, kind of hive-minded and worker bees, so this could imply
2078960	2085840	that they're just biological drones. Graze sometimes are often associated with future humans
2085840	2092080	as well, claiming that as humans evolve we rely less on our muscles, spend more time indoors,
2092720	2097520	receive more receding hair across our bodies, get enlarged eyes from looking at screens.
2098080	2101440	And that's interesting to think about too. I'm not sure about that I like it, but
2102000	2107840	also that graze are just humanoid figures that evolved on a planet with somewhat similar conditions
2107840	2115040	to Earth. Regardless of where they originate, the graze are fascinating and I somewhat believe
2115760	2120560	some sort of non-human intelligence on this planet resembles the classic gray.
2122800	2128160	Little green men, I'm not going to spend time on this one, especially since little green men are
2128160	2135760	essentially green graze, and the term little green men is often used by politicians to kind of shrug
2135760	2142960	off and make fun of any UAP or UFO sightings. You'll often time see Pentagon conversations or
2142960	2149520	official military talks when talking about UFOs, say we found no evidence of little green men,
2149520	2155040	so I just have no interest entertaining this entry. I understand I'm getting a little bit
2155040	2164000	pressed about this, but yeah, I stop here. Hoya Bashu is essentially the most haunted
2164000	2171280	forest in the world. It's nestled in Romania and has many unexplicable and strange phenomena such
2171360	2179440	as UFO sightings. I've never heard of this forest. I really don't have much to say about this entry
2179440	2185360	besides apparently in the 1960s there have been UFO sightings in the forest and images taken.
2187520	2196080	And lastly we have the 1952 Washington DC UFO incident. This mass sighting of UFOs occurred
2196080	2204800	over the weeks of July 19th through the 20th and July 26th through the 27th of 1952. At 11.40 pm
2204800	2211760	on Saturday July 19th 52 Edward Nugent an air traffic controller at Washington National Airport
2211760	2218000	spotted seven objects on his radar. He knew immediately that this was a very strange situation
2218000	2224640	as the crafts moved erratically compared to any normal aircraft. Nearby two controllers at the
2224640	2230880	national airport's radar equipped control tower looked outside and saw a hovering bright light in
2230880	2237760	the sky which departed at incredible speeds. At this point other objects appeared in all
2237760	2245040	sections of the radar scopes and they moved over the White House the U.S.'s capital. Jets were
2245040	2252640	scrambled from nearby Newcastle Air Force Base in Delaware to investigate the six fast moving
2252640	2258400	bright lights over the nation's capital. The jets found no such objects they eventually ran
2258400	2266240	out of fuel and had to return to their bases. Later on on July 26th 1952 the event occurred
2266240	2271920	again where a pilot and stewardess on a national airline's flight into Washington DC
2271920	2277600	observed erratic moving lights above their aircraft. Within minutes both radar centers at
2277600	2284960	national airport and Andrews Air Force Base tracked the objects. The occurrence made front page
2284960	2291760	headlines and caused a great deal of concern for President Harry Truman who made personal calls
2291760	2297680	to his Air Force aides to find out what the heck happened as well as garnered much CIA interest.
2298880	2305440	In response to this event the Robertson panel was formed to quote strip the unidentified flying
2305440	2309920	objects of their special status they have been given in the aura of mystery they have
2309920	2317840	unfortunately acquired end quote. So the 1952 UFOs over DC directly leads to the decades long
2318400	2322320	stigma around UFOs and this is very interesting and I'll make another video about this.
2324800	2331760	Well my friends that is layer one to the alien and UFO obscure oddities iceberg. I hope everybody
2331760	2336480	enjoyed this first layer a ton of interesting entries looking down the list we're going to have
2336480	2343120	a lot more extremely interesting things to cover and I cannot wait. Remember if you liked the video
2343120	2349040	consider tossing out a subscription and a like doesn't cost you nothing and it allows me to
2349040	2355440	make more interesting videos like this so stay tuned friends I'm going to start part two immediately.
