1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,680
Your Army's Research and Development Program is a continuing effort to help ensure the survival

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,640
of this nation. Army Industry Teamwork is essential to the accomplishment of the Army

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,320
Research and Development mission. To maintain superiority in our military arsenal, new ideas

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:40,200
are essential. New weapons must be developed and perfected to meet new requirements. In these days

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,400
of explosive advances in science and technology, Army Research and Development plays a major role

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:55,480
in maintaining America's military supremacy. You are saying to the human race for the first

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,240
time, an official intelligence representative at a high level from the US government is saying

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,160
publicly, we are not alone. We're definitely not alone. Absolutely the data points empirically

9
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:18,960
that we're not alone, yeah. You've said that we have the United States has spacecraft, intact

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:27,960
craft. Do we have bodies? Do we have species? Well, naturally when you recover something that's

11
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:39,840
either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter dead pilots. Well, the book is really my experience

12
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,320
of as I lived them and research and development of the Army under General Trudeau, Arthur Trudeau,

13
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,320
when he drew me back in and put me in charge of that and established the Florida Technology

14
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:58,880
Division for me. These were the artifacts from the crash flying saucer, which we used the word

15
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,560
applied engineering. Dr. Tello is still alive, knows he helped him. We fed these things. He gave

16
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,480
me the job of finding industry or scientists that were close to these items and feed us to

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,480
them in normal R&D projects. And you're saying these items came from somewhere else. They came

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,160
from a flying saucer. How do you know that? Because they were marked in the files that's coming

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,360
from New Mexico. Roswell. Yeah, Roswell. Well, I think some came in might be another crash,

20
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,600
but these were came from New Mexico and Roswell especially. And the General Trudeau gave me the

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,640
job of working out a program, put these things out, feed them to industry, but there is provisions

22
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,040
feeding it. They can have the patents, but they had to feed them out back to our house as a competitive

23
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,400
edge of the Army and to the American people and the world as necessary. Before the 2023 congressional

24
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,560
hearings on UAP, before the Schumer legislation and before Grush, the 20th century saw a decorated

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,920
Lieutenant Colonel of the US Army speak and sign affidavits on the existence of non-human

26
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,720
intelligence, crashed UAP, and exploitation of technologies of unknown origin. The legendary

27
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,640
Philip J. Corso in his infamous book The Day After Roswell and lesser known but far more impactful

28
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,960
manuscript Dawn of a New Age have cemented Corso as one of the most controversial yet credible UFO

29
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,800
whistleblowers of all time. Lieutenant Colonel Corso central claims revolve around his time in

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,320
the US Army serving as the chief of the foreign technology division where he claims he not only

31
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,040
came in contact with autopsy reports of extraterrestrial beings but also craft and artifacts from UAP

32
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,200
crashes and discussed how under his command technologies found in UAP were seated into US

33
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,920
industry to give the army a competitive edge. But are Corso's grand and epic claims indeed true?

34
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,440
And what can we learn from these claims? What valuable research can be extracted from the names,

35
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,920
locations, agencies, incidents, and technologies mentioned by the late Corso? Hey guys it's UAP

36
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,280
Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me as we fully analyze and deconstruct the testimony of

37
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,320
Philip J. Corso in his claims of UAP crash retrieval, NHI biologics, and reverse engineering of

38
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,160
exotic technologies. Let's conduct a comprehensive deep dive into Corso ranging from carefully

39
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,120
analyzing statements made in his manuscript to digging through his military record and grand

40
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,520
claims. And some quick bookkeeping before we get started today. We are taking the global best seller

41
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,560
the day after Roswell co-written by Corso and throwing it out the window. We will instead

42
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,480
be focusing solely on Dawn of a New Age. The original notes and manuscript of Corso released

43
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:55,120
in Italy in 2003 and the US in 2011 after Corso's death in 1998 at the age of 83. We will do this

44
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,920
so we can directly study Corso's pure claims without the creative liberties taken in the

45
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:06,080
day after Roswell, possibly inserted by the other co-writer Bill Burns. According to Corso's son

46
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,840
Philip Jr. he originally had no plans to release his father's manuscript but did due to his father's

47
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,600
distaste for the best seller. As relayed by Jr. Corso went through the day after Roswell and

48
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,440
highlighted everything he did not say or did not like. He got solely halfway through before giving

49
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,560
up due to frustration with the book. Multiple individuals were privy to the manuscript before

50
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,400
Corso's death such as Colonel John B. Alexander who remarked on sensational details featured in

51
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,440
the book missing in the manuscript. Due to the existence of the manuscript and Corso's son's

52
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,680
firm remarks of releasing the piece to correct the mistakes in the book that made his father

53
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,840
furious during his lifetime, we must give Corso the benefit of the doubt and study

54
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,000
solely his unfiltered words. For example, the day after Roswell is 130 pages longer than

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,680
Dawn of a New Age whilst the two cover roughly the same concepts. Day after Roswell adds in details

56
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,040
like recounting the time when Corso intimidated the CIA director of covert operations into

57
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,880
self-deleting, the manuscript features no such tale. Another example is the book originally

58
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,160
shipped with a forward written by U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond who angrily recounted his statements

59
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,920
once learning the book centered on UAP leading to an early copy reprint. While the manuscript makes

60
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,600
mention of Corso's relationship to Thurmond no such advocation by the senator was ever mentioned.

61
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,720
A final example I'll discuss is the missing first chapter from the book, The Roswell Desert,

62
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,880
which describes the Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash in painstaking detail and passes it off as an

63
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,240
accurate description even though Corso was not present at this event. So feel free to visit

64
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,600
the video description and download both the book and the manuscript and follow along as we dive into

65
00:06:49,600 --> 00:07:01,120
the claims of Corso. Philip Corso has as ironclad a background in the U.S. armed forces and military

66
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,480
intelligence as does David Grush. Few other witnesses even with proven accolades in the U.S.

67
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,920
military such as Roswell witness Walter Hott of the 509th bomb group come close to matching

68
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,400
Corso's rank, stations and history. Lieutenant Colonel Corso served in the U.S. Army from February

69
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:26,240
23, 1942 to March 1, 1963. The young man initially served in military intelligence during Europe in

70
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,840
World War II before becoming chief of the U.S. Counterintelligence Corps CIC in Rome.

71
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,320
At the end of the Second World War, Corso arranged safe passage for numerous Jewish

72
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,920
refugees out of Rome and served as personal emissary to Giovanni Battista Montini who would

73
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:48,880
become Pope Paul VI. Corso also served diligently in the early 1950s throughout the Korean War,

74
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,320
performing intelligence directly under General Douglas MacArthur as chief of the special projects

75
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,360
branch of the Intelligence Division Far East Command. His work here would focus mainly on

76
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,280
prisoners of war, POWs, and missing in action MIA soldiers during the war, tasked with investigating

77
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,000
North Korean POW camps and investigating the number of U.S. and U.N. POWs held at each camp.

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Phil would even testify in 1992 before the Senate Select Committee on POW-MIA Affairs on

79
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,280
hundreds of American soldiers being abandoned at these camps. Corso served on the staff of

80
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,600
President Eisenhower's National Security Council for four years from 1953 to 1957.

81
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,640
Skeptics and detractors of Corso claimed he was never a member of this NSC under Eisenhower,

82
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,360
however. The 1992 Senate Select Committee hearing report would say otherwise,

83
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,160
where the retired Lieutenant Colonel was clearly listed as NSC staff under the Eisenhower administration.

84
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,440
We can also analyze Corso's own FOIAd military documents which show him as a member of the

85
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,520
Operations Coordinating Board, a U.S. secret covert operations committee established in 1952

86
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:05,360
by Eisenhower under Executive Order 10483, which reported directly to the National Security Council.

87
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,720
In 1960, Corso joined and shortly became commander of the Army's Pentagon-based

88
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,360
Research and Development Program, the illustrious foreign technology division,

89
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,880
under Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau. This foreign technology division is not

90
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,840
the Air Force's infamous foreign technology division born out of the Air Force Technical

91
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,640
Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This program stems from the

92
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,200
Office of the Chief of Army R&D and has almost zero trace or record outside of Corso's own

93
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,720
military documents, and we'll discuss this much further later on. I do briefly want to mention

94
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,160
some interesting context to lend to the credibility of Corso as we dive into his claims.

95
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,560
Viewers of my channel will know of my recent interview with Dr. Eric Davis of the Wilson

96
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,720
Davis Memo, where Davis intimately discussed President and former CIA director George H.W.

97
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,080
Bush's involvement with UAP legacy programs. Well, let's reference Jacques Valais' book,

98
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,400
Forbidden Science Pacific Heights, which speaks on Eric Davis and former President

99
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,600
Bush Senior's professional relationship. After a candid call initiated by Bush giving

100
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,040
Davis advice on his future career, the two spoke again and saw Davis ask Bush about his

101
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,880
interest in Corso's disclosures. Quote, could it be that Corso was mistaken in dealing with

102
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,080
the material he was handling? Could that have been Nazi hardware? End quote. Shockingly,

103
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,160
to the statement on Corso, Bush replied, quote, impossible. The two topics were clearly separated.

104
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,680
By that time, all German secrets had been processed and filed away. They were not used

105
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,000
as cover for anything else. End quote. Bush expanded on the 1954 alleged landing of non-human

106
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,760
intelligence at Holloman Air Force Base, where allegedly Eisenhower and NHI brokered a deal.

107
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,120
According to Bush, this event really did happen, resulting in a secret project with obscene

108
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,960
security. When the two spoke again, Bush told Davis he was briefed on legacy programs by Trudeau

109
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,640
at the time of the 1968 Mandel River's congressional hearings. The book says Colonel

110
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,080
Trudeau, however, I do think this is a typo referencing General Arthur Trudeau. Bush senior

111
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,440
claimed Trudeau told him his man Corso had been asked to testify before Congress and was able to

112
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,400
reveal rumblings of alien hardware that had been distributed to industrial labs. The Corso testimony

113
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,880
was squashed as a result of this conversation. And lastly, why did Corso wait until the 1990s

114
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,400
to disclose his experiences with UAP technology? Well, this is because he made a promise to

115
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,760
Trudeau. He would wait to speak until his death. What about the few people who are have criticized

116
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,120
you to say, well, why are you coming out now? You're violating your security oath. What do you

117
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,320
tell us? I've been asked that question many, many times. Number one is I had a nose with a general

118
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,480
till we won't discuss this. A general said, when I die, feel your release from your oath.

119
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:10,560
He died three years ago, and I started to write it. Number two is I couldn't talk about people

120
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,320
over with us that I had no right to talk about. In intelligence, like a newspaper man,

121
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,440
your source is not named unless he gives you permission to name him. I had no right to do that.

122
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,200
And so my own family cruise on my son says, 35 years, you didn't talk. You didn't even tell us.

123
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,080
So that's right. Why did I tell anybody? I had an oath was an honorable man, a great man.

124
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,600
And I wasn't about to betray that oath. And not enough knowing that I had never

125
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,560
any intention of writing a book or put that on paper. And there were in my mind a nice

126
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,480
moment there. I never thought I'd write a book or even get a new movie on it. That never entered my head.

127
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,040
Number two is I couldn't talk about people over with us that I had no right to talk about.

128
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,280
Shortly before his death in July of 1998, CAUS, Citizens Against UFO Secrecy,

129
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,480
published an affidavit released by Colonel Corso. This affidavit was signed for

130
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,880
attorney Peter A. Gersten of CAUS in order to file a lawsuit against the Department of Army.

131
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,800
This affidavit reads, quote, I, Colonel Philip J. Corso, retired, do hereby swear under the

132
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,560
penalties of perjury that the following statements are true, that all times here and after mentioned,

133
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,200
I was a member and officer of the defendant, that during my tenure with the defendant,

134
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,160
I was a member of President Eisenhower's National Security Council and former head

135
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,800
of the foreign technology desk at defendant's research and development department,

136
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,160
that on or about July 6th, 1947, while stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas,

137
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,160
I personally observed a four-foot non-human creature with bizarre-looking four-fingered hands,

138
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,880
thin legs and feet, and an oversized incandescent lightbulb-shaped head.

139
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,640
The eye sockets were oversized and almond-shaped and pointed down to its tiny nose. The creature's

140
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,440
skull was overgrown to the point where all its facial features were arranged frontally,

141
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,600
occupying only a small circle on the lower part of the head.

142
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,560
There were no eyebrows or any indications of facial hair. The creature had only a tiny flat

143
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,480
slit for a mouth and it was completely closed, resembling more of a crease or indentation between

144
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,520
the nose and bottom of the chinless skull than a fully functioning orifice. That in 1961, I came

145
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,920
into possession of what I refer to as the Roswell file. This file contained field reports, medical

146
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,360
autopsy reports, and technical debris from the crash of an extraterrestrial vehicle

147
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,360
in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. That I have personally read the medical autopsy reports,

148
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,960
which refer to the autopsy of the previously described creature that I saw in 1947 at Fort

149
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,280
Riley, Kansas. That the autopsy reports indicated the autopsy was performed at Walter Reed Hospital,

150
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,560
which was under the authority of the defendant at the time of the autopsy. That the autopsy report

151
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,160
referred to the creature as an extraterrestrial biological entity. Right off the bat here,

152
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,920
it sounds extreme Corso claimed to have observed a mangled body he would later learn was a deceased

153
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,720
bean from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash. If you are not well versed with the July 1947

154
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,560
Roswell UAP crash retrieval, I do recommend doing some homework before continuing with this project.

155
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,320
I'd recommend the Roswell cover up 75 years later, as well as my project UFO whistleblowers

156
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,200
volume one to hear from some credible whistleblowers on the incident. For this video, we will be

157
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,480
utilizing an array of interesting depictions of the crashed Roswell saucer. Based on reports

158
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,240
and eyewitness testimony, Corso solely labeled the craft as the Roswell crashed saucer in dawn

159
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,320
of a new age. We will explore all of these craft design in a future project solely focused on Roswell.

160
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,520
One night, I was a post duty officer. Post duty officer means that I was in control. For that

161
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:13,120
night, I was the one who checked all the guards, checked all security areas, fact checked the

162
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,000
whole post. I was a duty officer that night. And I went to the veterinarian section and one of

163
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,400
a sergeant I knew very well was Sergeant of the Guard that night. I told him,

164
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,240
Sarge, how's everything around here? And he said, fine, sir. I told him, you know,

165
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,960
they told me to be careful to watch this area because you have a sense of something sensitive

166
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,880
here. He said, you want to see it, sir? I told him, yeah, let's go look. And I knew this sergeant,

167
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,880
where he was a master sergeant. I went back and there was five crates there, like five or six,

168
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,200
I think it was five. I listed one up and here's this body there and floating in food.

169
00:16:51,280 --> 00:17:00,880
And I looked at it about 10, 15 seconds, not much more than that. So I put it back down and said,

170
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,920
Sarge, come on, get out of here now. I want to get you in trouble. Because I'm the duty officer,

171
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,360
I can go around, walk around here. But you might get in trouble for coming back. Just come on,

172
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,000
let's go, come out with me. So we went out and I told him, where did it come from, Sarge? He said,

173
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:25,600
well, five trucks came through here from an airfield in New Mexico, and they're heading for

174
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,760
Wright, Paterson Air Force. Now, in those days, I wanted all these big roads now. In those days,

175
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,120
Route 40 was about the only cross-country route. And the route that they took was Route 40,

176
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,280
going through Fort Raleigh, Kansas, and then up to Wright, Paterson Air Force.

177
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,280
And I said, well, stay away from the sergeant. I don't want you to get in any trouble.

178
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,680
I told him, I can walk around and see them. So, and I started to figure, what was that?

179
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,960
First, I thought it was a child, because it was small. Then I looked at this head and all,

180
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,520
right away, and this was only half of the matter, secondly. Then I put the end back down, and

181
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,960
the head was different. The arms were spindly, the body, it was gray.

182
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,880
So, right at that moment, I figured, I don't know what this thing is.

183
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,760
Corso's official records do indeed place him at Fort Raleigh at this date,

184
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,360
and he would claim he was told the convoy of trucks hauling the bodies were headed

185
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,560
for Wright, Pat, and came from Route 40. This is very interesting, as quite often Roswell

186
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,280
reports state wreckage was flown to Wright, Paterson Air Force Base, were deceased by

187
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,440
logics transported separately, and if so, why? Myriad UFO crash retrieval stories feature

188
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,720
flatbed Air Force and Army trucks hauling wreckage away, such as the 1953 Kingman and

189
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,240
1965 Kecksburg crash retrievals. Also an interesting line, I'm sure many picked up.

190
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,520
The body was referred to as an EBE, extraterrestrial biological entity,

191
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,440
the same phrase used in the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual. This manual describes two

192
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:11,120
sets of EBE, EBE 1 and 2. EBE 1 closely matches the description of Corso's observed body.

193
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,760
This affidavit provides little more information than Corso gaining first-hand knowledge of the

194
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,320
Roswell crash, but fortunately we have his entire manuscript to study.

195
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,160
Just to revisit, the bulk of Corso's testimony revolves around the U.S. Army's foreign

196
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:37,360
technology division serving to exploit technology of unknown origin, TuO, from crashed UAP and seeded

197
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,600
into U.S. industry to primarily bolster the U.S. Army war machine and, as a second directive,

198
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,200
benefit the U.S. economy. Through this program, we start feeding it out to industry, but this was

199
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:56,000
not on paper. They went out as normal research and development proposals, not to name something.

200
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,360
Yeah, you didn't put out a report that said there's some alien stuff figured out.

201
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,120
We put our regular research and development proposal that came from somebody's brain,

202
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,720
and also this was known among a select few, mostly combat officers head-to-head.

203
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,000
It came, we kept this among ourselves, because otherwise we were certain that they were

204
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,920
destroyed our organization and we had a good organization, General Trudeau pulled it together

205
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,240
just a couple years before. They were destroyed our organization and labeled us as kooks and

206
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,960
taken our budget away. So, it had to be. We didn't cover because we gave it to industry

207
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,400
what the provisions, and I'll repeat this, the provisions were to come back to us with what

208
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,480
you prove, competitive edge of the army, give it to the people and to the world if necessary,

209
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:48,080
and take the patents. This claim dating to 1962 parallels extremely closely the modern-day

210
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,840
disclosures that branches of U.S. military work closely with contractors under unacknowledged

211
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,600
special access program in order to exploit technologies of unknown origin to primarily

212
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,600
benefit the U.S. military. Let's monitor this evolution closely as we explore CORSO. It is

213
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,280
endlessly fascinating to compare the secrecy and centralization of technology exploitation programs

214
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,720
under the foreign technology division as outlined by CORSO. All the way to how these UAP legacy

215
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,680
programs may operate today, stove piped and protected from congressional oversight nestled

216
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,280
within various intelligence agencies and military institution in league with defense contractors,

217
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,760
UARCs, and FFRDCs. Anyways, to the memo. After a brief forward and acknowledgement with the

218
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,040
awesome statement quote, if one passage in these memoirs helps you survive in a troubled world,

219
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,800
then all this work is not in vain end quote. CORSO begins an introduction for the reader.

220
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,360
Philip begins by giving the reader valuable insight into the creation of army research and

221
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,240
development projects exploiting technologies of unknown origin. And guys moving forward,

222
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,720
research and development will now be shortened to R&D and technologies of unknown origin will

223
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,640
be shortened to TUOs. This sort of inception of a legacy UAP program gives us a framework to

224
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,560
understand the construction and evolution of such programs. CORSO also quotes the father of German

225
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:16,720
rocketry, flying saucer researcher and mentor of Werner von Braun, Hermann Oberth, who once stated

226
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,920
quote, we cannot take the credit for our record advancements and certain scientific fields alone.

227
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:28,960
We have been helped by people of other worlds and quote, 1947 to 1958 saw the disorganized

228
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,120
dark ages of army research and development. NASA was founded in 1958, killing the army and DOD

229
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,640
project horizon, which served to build a moon base. Atomic energy was stripped from the army and

230
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,680
handed over to the Atomic Energy Commission. ARPA, the advanced project research agency,

231
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:52,960
was also founded clashing often with army R&D. It wasn't until 1958, all army R&D was pulled

232
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,320
under one single department, the office of the chief of army R&D. This was Lieutenant General

233
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,400
Arthur Trudeau, who handled all personnel, tech services, laboratory and installations as well

234
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,320
as budget. Trudeau would then create the foreign technology division and designate young CORSO

235
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,080
as its chief. CORSO would take quote, all reports on foreign technology, which included foreign

236
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,160
beans and events, those not of this world and quote, we will discuss this station and division

237
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,400
in much greater detail later in the project. But for now, we are focusing solely on the

238
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:34,080
manuscript's introduction. This led according to CORSO to the golden age of army R&D from 58 to 63.

239
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,400
However, in this time, the army still faced many challenges impeding their work,

240
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:45,200
civilian control of space efforts, DoD opposers, adverse policy guidance and the animosity of

241
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,080
CIA Department of State. This would all lead to the hyper secrecy of all R&D data pertaining to

242
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,920
areas out of this world. All of these materials were compartmentalized and trusted amongst a select

243
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,600
few quote, great efforts were made to bring large industry and select laboratories into the army

244
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,680
R&D fold, end quote. CORSO also states quote, the partners we sought and gathered were US industry,

245
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,040
a strong laboratory support and many leading universities, end quote. I do believe this small

246
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,160
line is one of the most crucial aspects of CORSO's testimony, believe it or not. Quite often on this

247
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,840
channel, we talk not only about contractors involved in UAP legacy programs, but also university

248
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,840
affiliated research centers, as well as federally funded research and development centers, semi private

249
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,080
institutions. One such organization created during this golden age of army R&D is an FFRDC,

250
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,640
I believe is up to their eyeballs in UAP legacy programs, MITRE. Officially established in 1958,

251
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,640
MITRE was created by MIT Lincoln Labs employees, creating SAGE, the semi automatic ground

252
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,680
environment program to coordinate radars to produce imageries of airspace for the military.

253
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,040
A thesis I'd like to keep in mind during this exploration was the MITRE FFRDC created in part

254
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:07,280
to fulfill the need of army UFO R&D to see technology into US industry. Of course the foreign

255
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,800
technology division was created a year later in 1960, however CORSO does state before his station

256
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,640
at the new office, material exploitation efforts by the army had been ongoing since Roswell. At

257
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,360
an undisclosed date, but presumably around the time or just before the creation of the foreign

258
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:30,720
technology division in 1960, CORSO states the top 25 industries on the Fortune 500 list were contacted

259
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,920
and meetings were arranged with their board of directors, top personnel with the chiefs of army

260
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,600
R&D. Laboratories were strengthened and organized, gathering funds to attract the best and brightest

261
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,960
including foreign scientists such as those brought from Operation Paperclip. With contractors such as

262
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,440
Bell Labs, who is credited with the development of the transistor and laser, two technologies

263
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,920
CORSO said were leveraged from UAP alongside universities and army laboratories. This conglomeration,

264
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,160
a powerful team, was tasked with exploiting TUOs. The guiding principle of this army project had

265
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,000
but two goals, national security of the United States and protection of the American way of life.

266
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,520
In a rare Art Bell coast-to-coast interview with CORSO and Colonel John B. Alexander,

267
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,720
CORSO would state the foreign technology division began to operate with a budget of $2 billion.

268
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,520
They weren't doing this gratis or for an investigation, you were commissioning them,

269
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,040
you had budget money, research and development money that came along with these items you were

270
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,920
giving them. We had a budget then it was tremendous, it was about $2 billion. $2 billion.

271
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,480
We also gave out RDTAD contracts, research development tests and evaluation contracts.

272
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:57,840
The first item that would be built from a research contract, we funded the building to the first

273
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:06,240
one and after that other people and other agencies funded it. So we would fund these until it was

274
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,640
actually developed. We had our laboratories, our atomic labs and the night viewing labs,

275
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,640
where our labs at Fort Bell were. Colonel, what aspect of this were you overseeing? In other

276
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,560
words, once you gave somebody a piece of this technology and a budget, what did you then do?

277
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,160
This RDT&E funding would equal over $10.5 billion today, quite the starting budget.

278
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,440
The mention of R&D test and evaluation contracts reminds me closely of witness Ed,

279
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,320
who made claims of a joint UAP reverse engineering group operating between NELIS

280
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,320
slash Area 51 and Edwards Air Force bases. After his service in the Edwards 412th group,

281
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,480
Ed would work for USAF at the Pentagon serving on acquisition, integration and RDT&E panel.

282
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,120
It was here Ed would claim $34 and $40 billion were siphoned off in respective years to non-air

283
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,200
force TOA transfer of authority funds. Here in the introduction Corso breaks down some of the

284
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,840
breakthroughs leveraged from the foreign technology division and golden age of R&D

285
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,280
from studying reports and wreckage from Roswell and possibly other UAP recoveries.

286
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,240
Let's go ahead and break these down. The first technology are image intensifiers,

287
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,240
aka passive night vision devices. Corso stated the night vision laboratory at Fort Belvoir,

288
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,000
Virginia created these first generation devices with aid from 48 US industries,

289
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,360
all with varying knowledge of the project. Allegedly information gathered from the 1947

290
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,880
Roswell crash led to this breakthrough. Passive systems were indeed constructed by the US Army

291
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,040
in the early 1960s. However, many individuals such as Colonel John B. Alexander challenged

292
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:01,120
this statement. One of the most contentious technologies discussed by Corso is fiber optics.

293
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,240
This point of Corso's testimony has been highly contentious like much of the materials.

294
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,680
Allegedly at Roswell, the recovery team discovered what they thought to be a broken wiring harness

295
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,080
with each loose strand and emitting a different color. These wires were fiber optics.

296
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,280
Bell Labs allegedly utilized this technology to spearhead the greatest advancements

297
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,240
in communication history. Now this point is contentious because French scientists were

298
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,400
indeed working on early developments of fiber optic principles in the early 1840s. Bell Labs

299
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,280
was involved in the development of fiber optics in the 1970s where they improved the technology

300
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,320
and minimized loss on mass scale production. Now let's keep in mind, Corso does say some

301
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,600
of the non-human technologies leveraged were used to bolster human technology, so perhaps this

302
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,720
drastic Bell Labs improvement is one of these instances. And speaking of Bell Labs, let's

303
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,800
remember back to the testimony of Edgar Fouchet, who stated that FFRDC's Livermore Labs and

304
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:06,960
Sandia National Labs reverse engineered the propulsion system for the TR-3B alien reproduction

305
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,000
vehicle. According to the Majestic-12 documents in the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit report,

306
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,560
Sandia has also served as a prime site for UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering operations.

307
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,560
In fact, I have spoken so much about Sandia, I highly recommend committing them and FFRDCs

308
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:30,720
in general to memory. The telephone company AT&T was given managerial responsibilities

309
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,000
of Sandia National Labs by President Harry Truman in 1949. As of 1925, Bell Labs and their

310
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,240
engineering R&D department was placed under shared ownership of Western Electric and AT&T.

311
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,080
Very interesting connections here. Another alleged leverage technology were super tenacity fibers

312
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,000
from one single strand of fiber that could not be damaged. The Army at that time, according to Corso,

313
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,520
had a tremendous need for fibers, for flak jackets, parachutes, and other military items.

314
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,840
Important to note, dawn of a new age states these fibers were utilized to construct

315
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,040
composites for stealth technology and civilian aircraft, while day after Roswell states these

316
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:18,240
fibers were used to construct Kevlar, the material in bulletproof vests and made by DuPont in 1965.

317
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,960
Strange molecular alignment techniques were additionally studied from the Roswell crash.

318
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,480
The craft showed molecules down to individual atoms, had been aligned in various patterns

319
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,200
resulting in incredible hardness and resistance to scratches, stress, strain, and shear in metals

320
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,800
while all repelling cosmic particles and radiation. The Chief of R&D of the Army thought this to be

321
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,880
a truly consequential discovery and thus special teams were organized to investigate this chemistry.

322
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,320
Corso stated this atomic rearrangement could lead to incredibly strong yet light spacecraft,

323
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,480
but in 1963 and possibly through 1993 the Army had not solved this issue.

324
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,680
I personally have heard some similar claims that non-human craft employ materials with

325
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:10,000
interesting atomic arrangements. Corso also believed fluid application was leveraged from UFO

326
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,760
propulsion and guidance systems. Fluidic principles led to the creation of the heart pump. Even though

327
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,840
fluidic principles are quite old, they were not utilized commercially until about 1960 for the

328
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,920
demand for reliable controls in space research. Two of the greatest technologies exploited by

329
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Army R&D according to Corso were the transistor and integrated circuit. As we mentioned above,

330
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:41,120
Bell Labs first introduced a point contact transistor in 1947. Jack Kirby of Texas Instruments

331
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,000
introduced the first hybrid integrated circuit between 1958 and 1959. Corso's testimony illustrates

332
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,840
a strange transistor with hair-like wires and leads and a chip in a stack of thin uniformly

333
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,680
shaped wafer-like components found in a crash retrieval. Quote, these formed complete electrical

334
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:05,520
circuits and developed into the micromodule concept. CRD said it would take 50 years to develop the

335
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:12,480
transistor and 200 years to develop the chip. It came in a short span of five years, end quote.

336
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,960
Corso does state this development occurred before the Golden Age of Army R&D, 1958 to 1963,

337
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,360
with advancements as early as 1947. As he states improvements were made to the existing technologies

338
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,760
in 1959 with the introduction of miniaturization of circuits. In fact, when Corso began his service

339
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,040
as special assistant to Trudeau in 1960, Trudeau would allegedly show in both transistors and

340
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,920
integrated circuits and engage in some philosophical discussion on the implications of harnessing

341
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:47,280
off-world technologies for human use. Perhaps this does indeed adhere to conventional history,

342
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:53,120
which states physicist Julius Edgar Lillianfield proposed the concept of a field effect transistor,

343
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,680
an FET, in 1926. But it was not possible to construct a working device at that time. It was

344
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:06,320
not until 1947 we saw application of transistors. The Lieutenant Colonel also stated the laser,

345
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,920
who many program members suggested was the EBE's method of communication over vast distances of

346
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,760
space was derived from the Roswell crash. As we know, the laser, which stands for light amplification

347
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,640
by stimulated emission of radiation, was created in 1960 under Bell Labs. And again, what was the

348
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:31,920
purpose of all of this R&D in Corso's own words, quote, to guarantee a superior competitive position

349
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:38,000
given the superior data by the accidental discovery at Roswell, we reduce scientific data

350
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,600
to a definite development to fulfill a military requirement. We never quibbled over who discovered

351
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,040
or invented the development. The feeling was if a discovery was adapted to a concrete development,

352
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,360
we would all be ahead in the game and the nation would benefit, end quote.

353
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,040
This reminds me almost identically of the claims made by David Grush regarding secrecy of legacy

354
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,840
program operations. So the reason for the secrecy exactly is what?

355
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,840
Feudalistic dominance, who can have both asymmetric technology for, it seems like,

356
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:20,560
just fueling the war machine. Grush says that through the 50s and 60s, encounters with the

357
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,040
NHI continued, as did the cover up. Key to mention here, it is stated in the manuscript

358
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,960
extraterrestrials never gave humans a thing. Not one scientific advantage came voluntarily.

359
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,360
Everything was garnered by accident or perhaps force in some cases. This raises a very interesting

360
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,320
point. Numerous individuals such as David Grush have flirted with the subject of agreements with

361
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,160
humans and non human intelligence. If these agreements do not involve technology, what do

362
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:57,600
they involve? And it's quite clear that you're talking about agreements between America and

363
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:03,840
non human intelligences. Have we made agreements with non human intelligences?

364
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,920
That's the kind of information I really hope national leadership is able to get to the bottom

365
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,880
of. I need to pin you down on this. Are there agreements between non human intelligences

366
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,920
and the American government? I think that's a question that I would

367
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,800
like to know all the details of as well. Or is it possible R&D programs were kept separate from

368
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,840
other compartmentalized programs that inherited technology, a separation of programs I believe

369
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,840
is active today? I think something that a lot of people don't ask that has kind of captured my

370
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,840
attention. During your time investigating legacy programs, did you see much collaboration

371
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,640
or compartmentalization between programs that may exist in Navy Air Force Army?

372
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,800
It's too snowpiped or compartmentalized. You can't open it up to another one unless there is a need

373
00:36:50,800 --> 00:37:00,880
to do that. That need to get access is defined on a government form called the DD-254.

374
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:10,640
And the DD-254 documents who has access and why and what gets access. And if you're going to

375
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,200
have to get access to another compartmentalized program, then that has to be justified in the

376
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,400
DD-254. And usually that's not justified because programs don't really overlap.

377
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,760
However, Corso's claims NHI technology was taken, not inherited, mirrors closely the

378
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,920
claims of Fluxliner alien reproduction vehicle witness Brad Sorensen, who was told at the 1988

379
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,320
Norton airshow the basis for the ARV the Roswell wreckage was taken without the consent of its

380
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,560
operators. Another interesting parallel to today is a contractor Corso makes numerous mentions to,

381
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,120
the Sparey Rand Corporation. Not to be confused with the Rand FFRDC, Sparey Rand was a major

382
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,720
20th century electronics corporation and military contractor. Sparey Rand was additionally named

383
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,160
in General Trudeau's memoirs as a frequent spot for meetings. He would often meet with their CEO

384
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,480
and directors to discuss Army R&D projects. One such director was the legendary General Douglas

385
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,800
MacArthur. Sparey Rand went defunct in 1986 and many of its divisions became part of Honeywell,

386
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,640
Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. Corso then goes on to mention a long list of

387
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,320
other benefits garnered from UFO technology exploration. One I want to mention is anti-missile

388
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,920
missiles for the Star Wars program. Long have I stated the Star Wars program, formerly known as

389
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,760
the Strategic Defense Initiative, had a secondary function to fund UAP programs and act offensively

390
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,960
against UAP. There is indeed interesting research to suggest although the program was set in place

391
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,880
by Reagan in 1983, Eisenhower established the program for UAP offensive action during his

392
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,480
presidency. The Colonel discussed the need for protection against the EBEs themselves. The

393
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,920
Lieutenant Colonel stated EBEs have performed acts of war with superior advanced equipment and

394
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,520
superior techniques. The threat internally was treated similar to the Soviets as a fig leaf

395
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,520
policy where the Soviets and non-human threatened existence but were not considered enemies. These

396
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,160
acts included the controversial abduction phenomena and mutilation as well as quote

397
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,440
spying on our atomic installations. Hindering missile and space equipment testing, hampering

398
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,920
our military deterrent and nuclear deterrent, halting and interfering with exploration of

399
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,120
moon and Mars, causing crashes of aircraft and casualties among military personnel and

400
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,000
tampering with human and animal genome, end quote. I would like to explore some of these

401
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,520
more controversial claims in a future project so let's hold on to this. This passage is key to

402
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,640
reflect on as in the revelations of David Grush we have heard people have been hurt and killed by

403
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,960
UAP but cannot attribute malicious intent to these intelligences. To conclude with the introduction,

404
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Corso placed much admiration for the individuals behind exotic R&D. These veterans of World War

405
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,840
II in Korea were entrusted with the United States government's highest level deepest secrets.

406
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:16,000
Now that we have spent over half an hour investigating the introduction of the manuscript,

407
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,360
we can start to dive in and explore more of Corso's claims in depth. Throughout the

408
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,160
introduction of this document, we heard Corso recount for the reader much of his early military

409
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,280
career but quickly let's recap some of his highlights right before he met General Trudeau in

410
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:40,000
his own words. Well your career to the to the point that you meant the general was a very honorable

411
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,880
and fairly normal military career. It was in comp at this time because we were fighting the

412
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:54,560
war in North Africa in Italy and then I joined the general. I went to Korea last time. I participated

413
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:02,000
in the Korean War and I joined the counter staff over there and I came back and when I came back to

414
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,320
the pages I joined Kevin Heidenhaal as one of the military in the United States with the White House

415
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,120
and there my career for the team I was in the White House for four years and from there I took

416
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:23,360
command of of the military defiant, the army's military defying range, the White Vans and then

417
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:32,880
I took the command of the Germans and I became I stayed in command 18 months and then I became

418
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,880
Secretary General of the Army and from there I came back to the United States and General Trudeau

419
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,280
had reorganized research and development of the army and he sent for me and I joined him as a

420
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,720
special assistant and chief of the forces of the division. Corso claimed his military career saw

421
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,640
him earn nine clearance levels above top secret up to the coveted eyes only material for the White

422
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,720
House NSC matters. Achieving these clearances is when Lieutenant Colonel would claim he became

423
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,960
aware of UFO information though nothing pertaining to legacy programs or reverse engineering since

424
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:16,000
his NSC position occurred from 1953 to 1957. We can wager any interesting UFO information was

425
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,360
presented to him as Intelligent Staff O for the Operations Coordinating Board attached to the

426
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,880
National Security Council. Corso claimed his superior and the President Special Assistant C.D.

427
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,280
Jackson along with President Eisenhower himself were the only individuals aware of Corso's clearances.

428
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,400
C.D. Jackson here is Charles Douglas Jackson Special Assistant to Eisenhower and Government

429
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Psychological Warfare Advisor. Jackson served as liaison between the freshly minted CIA and the

430
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,920
Pentagon. Jackson was also a member of the Committee on International Information Activities.

431
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,600
Corso did discuss how in officer school he began specializing in air defense and ballistic missiles.

432
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,760
Twice during his command of missile units unidentified objects were picked up over New

433
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,680
Mexico and Germany traveling at over 3,000 miles per hour. Corso was ordered to destroy

434
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,200
any records and tapes. Following service as commander of the 71st Missile Battalion in Germany

435
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,240
and Inspector General of the 7th Army, Corso was led to become Special Assistant to the Chief of

436
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:22,720
Army R&D Lieutenant General Arthur G. Trudeau quote. If Edwin Teller could be called the father

437
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,000
of the H-Bomb, General Trudeau could be called the father of the ballistic missile end quote.

438
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And now we can get into some of the very juicy details. In 1960 Corso entered into his position

439
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,840
as Chief of the Foreign Technology Division having seen a small strange body while also being read

440
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,960
into some unknown UFO information due to his clearance levels and had been told of some exotic

441
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,560
technologies leveraged from off-world technologies by his mentor and boss Arthur Trudeau. But I do

442
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,160
find it strange Corso does not write about the 1947 non-human intelligence body encounter in

443
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,760
dawn of a new age as we observed and assigned affidavit. This is especially strange because

444
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,760
this encounter of biologics was relayed in the book day after Roswell so I guess let's go back

445
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,960
and hear this story recounted in Corso's own words. And I was instructor at the intelligence

446
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:21,600
school and we had an aggressor force that I was. Though one night I was post-duty officer. Post-duty

447
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:27,520
officer means that I was in control. For that night I was the one who checked all the guards,

448
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,400
checked all security areas, in fact checked the whole post. I was a duty officer that night.

449
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:40,480
And I went to the veterinarian section and one of a sergeant I knew very well was Sergeant of

450
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,160
the Guard that night. I told him, Sarge, how's everything around here? And he said, fine, sir.

451
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,720
I told him, you know, they told me to be careful to watch this area because you have a sense of

452
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,600
something sensitive here. He said, you want to see it, sir? I told him, yeah, let's go look.

453
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,200
And I knew this sergeant very, he was a master sergeant. I went back and there was five crates

454
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,040
there, like five or six, I think it was five. I listed one up and here's this body there and

455
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:16,720
floating in fluid. And I looked at it about 10, 15 seconds, not much more than that. So I put it

456
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,600
back down and said, Sarge, come on, get out of here now. I want to get you in trouble because

457
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:27,040
I'm the duty officer. I can go around and walk around here. But you might get in trouble for

458
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:33,200
coming back. Just come on, let's go, come out with me. So we went out and I told him,

459
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,800
where did it come from, Sarge? He said, well, five trucks came through, I'm coming through here

460
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,760
from an airfield in New Mexico and they're heading for Wright, Paterson Air Force. Now,

461
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,320
in those days, I wanted all these big roads now. In those days, Route 40 was about the only cross

462
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:56,240
country route. And the route that they took was Route 40, going through Fort Raleigh, Kansas,

463
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,880
and then up to Wright, Paterson Air Force. And I said, well, stay away from Sarge. I don't want

464
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,680
you to get in any trouble. I told him, I can walk around and see. So, and I started to figure,

465
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:15,280
what was that? First, I thought it was a child because it was small. Then I looked at this head

466
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,640
and all, right away, and this was only happened a matter of seconds. Then I put the end back down

467
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:30,320
and the head was different. The arms were spindly, the body was gray. So, right at that moment,

468
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:36,560
I figured, I don't know what this thing is. So, like an intelligence business, I just better put

469
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,160
it on back of my head here and wait to maybe in the future, I get cooperation so I can evaluate

470
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,800
what it is. As Chief of the Foreign Technology Division, the young Lieutenant Colonel would

471
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,480
receive, quote, all reports on foreign technology, which included foreign beans and events, those

472
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,680
not of this world, end quote. He would spearhead a team of Nazi scientists brought over from

473
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,520
Operation Paperclip, as well as US scientists and technicians. Some of these pieces of technology

474
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,600
were known to be from crashed UFOs, while others were educated guesses. Corso did recognize his

475
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:15,200
position arose almost exclusively from his close relationship with the infamous Trudeau. In fact,

476
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,320
Trudeau personally gave Corso what is now famously known as the Roswell file, a box of

477
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,520
materials and files pertaining to the infamous crash.

478
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:54,000
I opened it up and I started finding the material which he called later, Corso's Jump,

479
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,720
and there was a bunch of wires, which I didn't know what they were, which were immediately colors.

480
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:07,360
I didn't even know if they were wires. I had this chip, this integrated circuit, a laser instrument.

481
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,400
They could do like some of the fine cuttings that they save in manual simulations.

482
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:24,080
And I had also fiber optics and I had those and I recalled them. We started that because

483
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:31,280
one of my, and I had reports on autopsy that performed a law to read on our lab, which we

484
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:38,080
financed the law to read. And when I read that, it matched with what I saw for roughly 14 years

485
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:46,320
before. The whole autopsy was similar, what I'd seen. So then I start putting two and two together

486
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,200
and gradually these items will start, and then the general called me and said,

487
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,800
work out a program. Find scientists who are working on these things and shove them in there.

488
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,800
I told the general, I have to study these things old because really,

489
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,960
I told him, I'm not that bright. I don't know what these things and all of these things are,

490
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,160
but they're important. He said, well, Phil, they are important. Give me a program what they are.

491
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,760
Anyways, after Corso was designated as the chief of the foreign technology division by Trudeau

492
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:23,120
in 1960, Corso was given four subjects to keep track of. One, foreign development of this world.

493
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:29,680
Two, foreign intelligence and developments not of this world. Three, act as interim project

494
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:36,480
officer on select R&D projects and four, all other duties assigned as special assistant

495
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,960
to the CRD for the US Army. National security measures meant points one, three and four fell

496
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,800
into normal categories, but point two was a whole different matter. Many experts in the

497
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,560
know felt the army was helpless in the face of NHI technology. Let's briefly touch on some more

498
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:59,520
technologies and items featured in the Roswell report given to Corso by Trudeau. We have yet to

499
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:05,200
discuss amongst the physical technologies and reports on artifacts such as a paper thin high

500
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,320
strength metal found at the Roswell crash. Corso discovered autopsy reports discussing

501
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:17,200
beings almost identical to what he observed in 1947. Accompanying images show decomposed

502
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:23,040
bodies roughly four feet tall and medical reports detailed heavy variations to human anatomy and

503
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:29,600
organs as well as skin and bone composition. These biologics heart and lungs were very large

504
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,880
with a remarkably different muscular structure. The beings appear to have skin and bone structure

505
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:41,120
built to protect vital organs from cosmic action, cosmic radiation or gravitational pull.

506
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,680
And it is interesting, according to the manuscript, a transparent film over the eyeball

507
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:51,680
of the deceased EBEs led to Trudeau mandating the pursuit of passive night vision technology.

508
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,040
Analyzing every single file he had on the Roswell crash saucer, Corso did notice some

509
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:03,440
odd discrepancies between the beans and their craft. The files had no mention of food or nourishment

510
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,720
for the beans in the craft nor mention of water or drinking water or water for cleansing the body.

511
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,440
The files made no mention to refrigeration equipment, no mention of medical equipment

512
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,200
besides what the recovery crew guest was a first aid kit and there was no toilet or waste disposal

513
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:26,160
facilities or no rest and no recreation facilities. Corso and the OCRD believed these beans to be

514
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:32,560
clones or at the very least expendable creatures sent by some sort of intelligence. The chief

515
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:37,520
even believed the Roswell craft to be a reconnaissance craft that would return to a mothership for

516
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:43,520
necessities. The Lieutenant Colonel also reasoned possibly this species had solved gravitational

517
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,360
time dimensional travel and could instantaneously return to their base. Throughout the manuscript

518
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:56,480
Corso would often hint at multiple UAP or crashed flying saucers analyzed. It is frustrating we don't

519
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:03,440
get a total count besides confirmation of the Roswell crash as well as the 1947 July San Augustine

520
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,680
New Mexico crash in which allegedly a flying saucer crashed with no seams, joint lines,

521
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,680
rivets or weld joints. This is a ubiquitous description in almost all UFO crash retrieval

522
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:21,520
reports. So when I start putting all this on the extraterrestrial together and finally gave it a

523
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:28,560
name I told them it looks like you know these are clones and so the name came out extra extraterrestrial

524
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:34,320
biological entity that's what we figured they were better described than we never used the letters

525
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:41,760
ET there was no such thing. He said that they look like clones how they're clones not look like

526
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:50,400
clones they were clones we figured that they were created by some some other intellect and we also

527
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:58,400
came to the decision that they were made to specifically the travel in space because we knew

528
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:06,320
in those days that man could not travel in space some bones are affected his muscles are affected

529
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,920
his brain is affected man cannot travel in space so we came to the conclusion that these creatures

530
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:19,520
whatever they are are made to travel in space and gradually through what work we did we found

531
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,320
out that disintegrated with the flying saucer and with you because most of the failures making

532
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:30,480
by saucers were the guidance system that this creature was also the guidance system was part

533
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,920
of the engine of the flying saucer it is also fascinating to see how the team was inspired

534
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,680
and attempted to study harnessing brainwaves to control aircraft and anti-missile missiles

535
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,040
this inspiration came from apparent discoveries that these extraterrestrial biological entities

536
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,640
were part of the craft's guidance systems this may seem like science fiction however we do live

537
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:59,120
in an age where consciousness connection is indeed discussed with UFO craft piloting and

538
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,520
we came to a conclusion even in those days that these were the reason most flying saucers have

539
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:09,680
failed is because our conclusion was that this being is part of the guidance system he's part

540
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,120
of that saucer i've just had one of the most senior scientists in the u.s defense department

541
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:25,760
former admit to me that he was read into a ufo crash retrieval program i've spoken to well over

542
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:35,600
20 people now what i was told consistently was the technology is mind-blowing and they are not

543
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:44,640
in a position to be able to engineer it yet because it's just light years beyond what we

544
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:51,920
have it's a completely new type of physics is what one person said to me and you might be interested

545
00:54:51,920 --> 00:55:02,160
in this jay because of the sort of direction that your interests have taken without expanding on it

546
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:09,280
expanding on it one of the people i spoke to told me that it had a lot to do with a mind

547
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,000
interface connection with the engineering that it was driven by some kind of consciousness or

548
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:22,480
some kind of intelligent connection with machinery that was beyond our understanding

549
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,080
shockingly we can add even more context to these claims by analyzing the files of the legendary

550
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:34,080
lennard stringfield and take a look at a report of a possible recovered vehicle or alien reproduction

551
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:40,560
vehicle that utilized headband transceivers to operate quote len spoke to a mr. hines who had

552
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:45,600
a source from bell labs the informants stated that he was on the flight line at a california

553
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:52,160
air force base in the early 1950s and saw a ufo retrieval brought in he allegedly saw a cutaway

554
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,840
of the recovered craft plus the headband transceivers worn by the aliens anyone involved with the

555
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,800
retrieval was subject to intense scrutiny and search apparently one man must have kept a

556
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:08,800
part of the craft and he mysteriously disappeared he was never seen again the source feels that the

557
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:14,560
man was eliminated end quote chief corso somehow stumbled upon information that the soviets were

558
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:20,800
running their own parallel to you o exploitation program this may have stemmed from soviet spies

559
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:26,880
in new mexico tipping off stalling to the roswell crash where stalling allegedly gathered the ussr's

560
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,480
rightus to discuss the captured saucer quote some of the items found and analyzed by the russians

561
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,840
possess a similarity of items gathered in the united states others closely resemble material

562
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:43,600
collected by the us army soon after the crash end quote impactful statement as recently dr

563
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:49,280
eric davis confirmed the soviets did indeed observe and collect at least one crash retrieval

564
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,800
in their own territory it is unknown how exactly corso came across this intelligence regarding

565
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:01,040
the soviets but it is no surprise after the words of david grush grush says the united states is not

566
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:08,720
the only country that's encountered nhi and their technology he says our geo political rivals have

567
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:15,760
their own crash retrieval programs which they are also secretly exploiting for military purposes

568
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:21,520
we're in a competition with their adversaries to understand this and it's a it's a multi-decade

569
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:28,480
cold war that uh has been under our nose for so long and you know there is no good way to level

570
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:34,480
the playing field and hold other nation states accountable if they're doing unethical or illicit

571
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:40,880
activity as it relates to this subject however far down the line in 1993 corso would ask old

572
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:46,640
acquaintances to acquire about recovered materials from a kgb general while much of the information

573
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:54,560
held as top secret by kgb and gru corso was given a list of materials you can see on screen now

574
00:57:54,560 --> 00:58:00,000
let's temper our expectations as this list could easily have been disinformation given to corso

575
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,320
however one piece that stands out to me was a silvery tube found in the us in 1975 i wonder

576
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:12,960
if this possibly relates to the august 1974 chiwawa mexico crash i covered in which a us rapid

577
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,960
recovery team relieved a deceased mexican army squadron of a recovered craft possibly the soviets

578
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,480
traced this recovery and found materials missed by the convoy the foreign technology division

579
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:30,320
was working with lasers anti-missile missiles and directed energy weapons near the tail end of

580
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:36,800
corso's career lieutenant general trudeau retired in 1962 and the lieutenant colonel followed him

581
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:47,920
shortly in 1963 now what more can we learn about the foreign technology division and general

582
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,680
arthur trudeau trudeau is a member of the military intelligence hall of fame the general served in

583
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:59,280
world war two in the korean war trudeau served as chief of army intelligence but was relieved by

584
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:06,320
alan dolas director of the cia possibly for his extremely rigorous anti-communist stance the general

585
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:13,520
was shortly reinstated and eventually in 1958 the golden age of army r&d began according to corso

586
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,280
trudeau would then return to washington as director of army research and development the general was

587
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:25,520
so influential to the army he was one of eight former generals included in the army's 1970s oral

588
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:30,880
history project funny enough when trudeau was interviewed for this project corso was found

589
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:36,160
to be spending time with his friend trudeau in his kitchen this speaks to the close relationship

590
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:41,920
of the two and their friendship during and after their service and outside of corso we have only

591
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:47,920
one interesting piece to link the general to uap let's remember all the way back to forbidden

592
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,840
science where dr eric davis claimed bush senior stated he was indeed briefed by trudeau at the

593
00:59:53,840 --> 01:00:00,240
1968 mendel rivers congressional hearings now i'm sure many are familiar with the united

594
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:06,320
states air forces foreign technology division that operated out of right patterson from 1961

595
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:14,800
to 1991 to reiterate the office created by trudeau and chiefed by corso was not this infamous division

596
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:21,520
the air force program evolved from air technical intelligence center in 1961 and was a sign under

597
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:27,600
air force systems command the division reportedly operated on recovered russian mig jets however

598
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:33,120
due to the stove piping of ufo legacy programs it would not be shocking to think perhaps this

599
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:38,960
program also engaged with technologies of unknown origins parallel to its army department

600
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:46,320
let's reference us army colonel john b alexander's book ufo's myths conspiracies and realities

601
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:52,000
i know i've had my problems with alexander before and his discussion of the som 101 majestic

602
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,160
12 special operations manual however this quote is important quote corso stated that he had been

603
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,800
transferred back to the pentagon under trudeau and a division had been created for him called the

604
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:08,080
foreign technology division this is not to be confused with the large foreign technology division

605
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:13,120
of the u.s air force at right patterson ohio it was learned that the army foreign technology

606
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:18,240
division was formed as corso stated and then disappeared shortly after his retirement end

607
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:24,480
this is a fascinating point as after general trudeau four star general dwight e beach took

608
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,880
over command of army rnd and from there on out we find nothing of foreign technology division

609
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:38,160
why is this army rnd office proven to exist yet zero foya documents newspapers or online articles

610
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:43,520
exist about the correct program numerous references can be found to the air forces foreign

611
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:49,520
technology division but not the armies i find this very similar to the army's interplanetary

612
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:55,200
phenomenon unit which was discovered through foya to exist only throughout institutional memory in

613
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:01,440
the army i do believe this inability to track down the army's foreign technology division to be of

614
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:08,160
extreme consequence if corso's testimony is indeed true there is much value we can extract here

615
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:14,880
regarding uap legacy program operations this would mean the office of the chief of army rnd

616
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,960
created a very real program hidden and shadowed from the public eye by the publicity of its big

617
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:26,400
air force brother at right patterson throughout the manuscript corso would even comment passively

618
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,680
on this difference stating project moon dust and blue fly reported materials and intelligence

619
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,640
directly to the air forces foreign technology division out of right pad and we can do some

620
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:42,720
really interesting research by reading a primer on research and development in the us army we can

621
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:49,840
see in 1958 under trudeau the army established the army research office under the ocrd due to pressure

622
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:56,880
from civilian scientists which served as a single contact in the army to maximize army rnd efficiency

623
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:03,920
remember corso stated army rnd truly began to flourish in 1958 when army began doing rnd away

624
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,440
from civilian and institutions with prime eyes one can then reason the foreign technology

625
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,280
division may have run parallel to the aro army research office out of civilian and congressional

626
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,720
oversight this reasoning can be further supported when the document states the army chief of rnd

627
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:26,480
would have a parallel line of authority to handle technical services on matters in his area this

628
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,760
would in turn give the chief of rnd trudeau authority on assignment of key personnel

629
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:39,120
and allocation of rnd funds to technical services this rnd primer document also reveals some startling

630
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:45,200
revelations the army's initial needs for managing rnd efforts led to the creation of university

631
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:52,880
research initiatives u r i's independent laboratory in-house research i l i r and independent

632
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:59,120
research and development programs irads some of you may remember irads as a funding mechanism for

633
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:06,400
legacy programs mentioned by david grush furthermore these u r i and i l i r programs would eventually

634
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:12,800
lead to u a r c and f f r d c two types of military and federally controlled semi-private

635
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:19,360
groups that likely operate heavily with ufo legacy programs what a fascinating document there is

636
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:25,600
absolutely more to explore here such as the thesis of how legacy program architecture was born out of

637
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:37,360
army rnd i do want to spend some time visiting some of the smaller aspects to corso's disclosures

638
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:42,640
we glossed over discussing the manuscript corso additionally made some extremely interesting

639
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:49,200
claims regarding some information he gathered long after his service corso allegedly learned that in

640
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:55,920
february of 1987 colonel herald e phillips of the defense intelligence agency chaired a pentagon

641
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:02,000
group called the ufo working group this group apparently still in existence at the time of the

642
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:09,840
manuscripts writing in 1993 originally consisted of 17 men one army and three air force generals

643
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:16,320
di a scientists an army colonel three nsa officials a supervisor from the cia's domestic

644
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:21,520
collection division as well as a technical team from the cia's science and technology director

645
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:27,600
it well for one where is the navy here as the navy is likely up to its eyeballs in ufo legacy

646
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:33,120
programs such as the off-world technologies division housed at the naval surface warfare

647
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:40,320
center in crane indiana it seems strange that between 1987 and 1993 corso and his ufo working

648
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:45,120
group intelligence source would not know or not make mention to the navy's dealings in

649
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:50,720
uap legacy programs but let's go back to the mention of the cia's science and technology

650
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:58,000
directorate and how it is of extreme importance here by numerous accounts the cia ds and t is

651
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,560
where the quote unquote ufo portfolio is held according to eric davis as well as chris sharp

652
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:10,160
and many others the director of this position glenn gaffney was the individual who stopped

653
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:18,720
lockheed martin from divesting uap material to osap in 2008 additionally former cia ds and t deputy

654
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:25,680
director dug wolf helped create the cia office of global access in 2003 which was accused by

655
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:31,600
excellent journalist chris sharp as serving as a logistics coordinator agency alongside jsoc

656
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:38,320
joint special operations command for uap crash retrieval corso was way ahead of his time to

657
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,920
make mention to this this ufo working group according to corso also received funding from

658
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:50,560
us army inscom intelligence and security command founder major general albert stubblebein in the

659
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:55,680
last few projects i have done i have talked at length about stubblebein and his likely work in

660
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:02,720
uap legacy programs including fort hachuka in the 1960s stubblebein was also allegedly the man who

661
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:10,160
tried to pay off steven greer in the 1990s and the alleged founder of the nsa's men in black treat

662
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:14,960
tactical reconnaissance engineering assessment team we'll skip over this for now as we cover

663
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:21,600
this in-depth with edgar fuchet and the flying triangle arvs but for now how about this inscom

664
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:27,920
special forces unit the illustrious intelligence support activity isa was handed over to jsoc in

665
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,040
2003 the same year wolf constructed the cia office of global access which allegedly used jsoc for

666
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:42,560
uap retrievals isa is often known as the most secretive and clandestine of jsoc units even

667
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:50,160
outside of the ufo working group just how intimate is us army inscom with legacy programs and does

668
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:56,240
this working group not sound very similar to a majestic 12 leg structure let's take this time

669
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:01,600
to briefly point out another distinction between the book and the manuscript in day after roswell

670
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:07,760
claims are made of working adjacent to roscoe hill encoder and the infamous majestic 12 personnel

671
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:13,520
list under eisenhower and truman dawn of a new age sees corso recognizing the eisenhower briefing

672
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,320
document report but how he never saw the report at the nsc and white house

673
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:28,480
the vast majority of criticism against corso comes from analysis of the day after roswell

674
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:34,400
and his claims of technology ceding the lieutenant colonel's military accolades are beyond question

675
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:39,520
we have already addressed the stark differences between the manuscript and the book the book

676
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:46,000
clearly added myriad details to spice up the story of corso the manuscript is well it's tough

677
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,600
reading but it gives us an unbridled look into corso's experiences the manuscript was also

678
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,160
completed prior to the release of the day after roswell colonel alexander and others were shown

679
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:01,360
the completed manuscript around the time of the book's release while alexander jock valet and

680
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:06,240
others are still very critical of corso's they all maintain the lieutenant colonel's story

681
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:13,360
never wavered details were never altered added or subtracted corso sounded like a tape recorder

682
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:18,160
you could rewind or fast forward to parts of his disclosures and always hear the same details

683
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:24,640
never any wavering allegedly corso had but 24 hours to edit the day after roswell book which

684
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:31,280
led to no oversight on all the creative liberties in the piece one must ask why the subject of this

685
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:37,680
non-fiction book was stripped of all creative control of the project in his book john b alexander

686
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:42,640
details a letter he wrote to corso about all the issues related to the day after roswell

687
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:47,040
mind you these criticisms are all leveraged towards the book still interesting to keep in

688
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:52,320
mind and i highly recommend looking at this nonetheless link in the description many discrepancies

689
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:57,280
regarding technology seeding has been thrown at corso some of which we have already addressed

690
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:02,080
jock valet for example well versed in computer science stated corso's assertions regarding

691
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:08,160
integrated circuitry were not documented facts colonel alexander himself had specific issues

692
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:13,680
with the passive night vision system mentioned by corso alexander stated the genealogy of

693
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:19,200
infrared and nvg technology can all be accounted for alexander detailed how he spoke to the

694
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:24,560
director of night vision laboratory at fort belvoir virginia dr lou cameron who flatly

695
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:30,880
denied how an eye lens of nhi aided in passive night vision breakthroughs legendary researcher

696
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:37,040
stanton freedman was also extremely critical of corso associating him with bob lasar which in

697
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:42,800
my opinion regardless of skepticism against corso is very inappropriate freedman criticized

698
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,480
corso for his grand story absent of evidence this is a viewpoint i can absolutely empathize with

699
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:55,840
but what does stanton have to say now entirely differently in terms of background lieutenant

700
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:02,320
colonel philip j corso came out with the book on the 50th anniversary of roswell first published

701
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:11,680
right in roswell called the day after roswell in which he claims that when he was at the foreign

702
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:16,720
technology desk of the army research and development command at the pentagon under general trudeau

703
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:23,040
he surreptitiously slipped the filing cabinet full of advanced technology wreckage from roswell

704
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:30,160
into the hands of american industry and he saved the world that's how we got kevlar and

705
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:37,840
micro integrated circuits and a whole long list of things and uh it was a great story

706
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:46,160
and the forward of the book was by senator strong thurman the oldest serving member of the senate

707
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:52,960
who said nice things about corso but in his intro his forward says nothing about roswell

708
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:59,200
in his manuscript and book corso was indeed what you could describe egotistical but in his

709
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:05,520
memoirs he never once claimed to have been some sort of world savior he was very patriotic and

710
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,560
simply aimed to strengthen the army this is obviously not freedman's fault as the book

711
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:17,120
was his only available analysis on corso at the time well they make a very long story short when

712
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:23,440
you start checking on colonel corso lieutenant colonel corso things just don't check out he provides no

713
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,800
validation for any other claims there's no index in the book either they say new

714
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:35,680
documents finally released there's nothing new in there uh and many people have gone through i

715
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:43,040
know one phd who was a colonel in the military who sent me a list of 92 false claims made in the book

716
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:49,760
92 i mean just technically wrong all over the place well you can blame that on the co-author

717
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:57,600
maybe but uh some of the discoveries of physicists just won a nobel prize for example for work done

718
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:03,440
three years before corso was connected with the army research and development group

719
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:10,240
he's a nice gentleman i met him while he was alive uh but his claims

720
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:19,520
senator thurman withdrew his forward wasn't in the next edition of the book because it was written

721
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:25,280
for an entirely different book about corso's activities corso talked about the fbi his good

722
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:31,360
buddy hoover when his fbi file was released uh hoover had nothing but bad things to say about

723
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:37,680
corso now it muddied the waters and got a lot of attention why would such a distinguished

724
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:42,720
military man well the real military people will tell you he only made lieutenant colonel after

725
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:50,080
22 years in a lot of lieutenant colonels not nearly as many full colonels so it's another

726
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:56,640
example of taking advantage opportunism if you will uh he also claimed that he was a member of

727
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,040
the national security council and a sworn statement for a lawyer was going to go after the government

728
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:06,880
and spill out all colonel corso's files well i checked with the eisenhower library not only

729
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:11,760
was never a member of the national security council which is very prestigious indeed he never

730
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,680
attended a meeting of the national security council he was a liaison between the security

731
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:24,960
council and some other groups uh it doesn't help ufology to have this kind of thing going on

732
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:35,280
people accept a great deal and his book sold well but i'm sorry it isn't what it claims to be

733
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:43,680
it's not a real expose of the truth about roswell and flying saucers and government's new technology

734
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:51,680
cut now in july of 2024 john greenwald and the black vault published documents released by

735
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:58,160
the fbi on corso and no no documents discussing ufo's a portion of these documents pertain to

736
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:04,560
in 1964 to 65 fbi background check on corso for his perspective position on the immigration

737
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:10,000
and national security subcommittee of the house of representatives corso had allegedly provided

738
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,800
some unfounded claims in the past according to these documents delivering a list of fabian

739
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:21,040
socialists to his good friend arthur trudeau the fbi was unable to validate these claims

740
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:26,880
corso was also investigated for spreading claims garnered from cia sources that lee harvey oswald

741
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:34,000
assassin of jfk was an fbi informant now oswald being either an fbi or cia informant probably

742
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,080
does not seem too unlikely to everybody regarding a soviet defector michael gullinowski the fbi

743
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:46,320
document state quote another government agency has characterized corso as a parasite who has never

744
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:52,000
produced any intelligence through his own efforts but has profited from information developed by

745
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,840
dedicated government agents and investigators end quote all of these critical files on corso

746
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:04,080
were cross references and not main files meaning the fbi never officially investigated corso

747
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:10,240
from these files it does appear corso liked to quote unquote waste the fbi's time making

748
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:16,160
accusations no content here actually discusses his duties with the foreign technology division

749
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:22,000
let alone the army and of course it is odd the selection of documents released when they were

750
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,720
released why are there no documents on corso's army position and why are there no documents on

751
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:33,280
the foreign technology division my greatest issue with corso arises from a massive firsthand

752
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:38,880
experience relegated to the very end of his manuscript remember corso claimed to have

753
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:45,600
witnessed an extraterrestrial body in 1947 observed ufo's on radar at ballistic missile sites in

754
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:51,840
1958 and 1959 and eventually studied materials recovered from uap crashes for the foreign

755
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,200
technology division corso's affidavit says as much without reference to the nike missile site

756
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:02,880
encounters however at the end of this manuscript corso recounts an incident while in command of

757
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:09,440
a missile silo at white sands missile range corso claimed while driving alone in an isolated area

758
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:15,120
he sought shelter from the heat in an abandoned mine within the mine he claimed to have encountered

759
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:21,680
face to face a bean of non-human intelligence the bean was drawn in corso's manuscript and

760
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:27,440
communicated to him telepathically we can also see him relay drawings of this bean in a long

761
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:33,520
lost interview featured on weaponized with george nap the bean wished to leave the surrounding area

762
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,320
however active radar interference from nearby installations were preventing its craft's

763
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:44,080
departure a common theory by corso and some roswell researchers is radar systems interfered

764
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:50,240
with craft navigation leading to crashes i am still very skeptical on this point corso

765
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:56,240
asked the bean what he would get in return for lowering the radar coverage the bean responded

766
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:02,720
quote a new world if you can take it end quote corso would then grant the beans wish when he

767
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:08,480
returned to his installation this experience was so profound to him he would often contemplate the

768
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:14,960
meaning of the statement during life corso would even relay this story to john b alexander

769
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:22,640
george nap and possibly others including a film to his grandchildren somehow danie she hand saw

770
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:29,360
i i found to be extraordinarily important the the little eight millimeter home movie that uh

771
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:36,960
that uh kernel corso actually uh produced to be shown to his grandchildren after he died uh this

772
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:43,440
this is this i i found to be extraordinarily persuasive that he and i got to see the film uh

773
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:49,200
but it wasn't supposed to be shown till after he died and uh and i was shown the film uh and it

774
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,920
shows him talking to his grandchildren saying that even though i'm gone now i wanted to make sure

775
01:18:53,920 --> 01:19:02,080
you understood this and what he did is he talked about the fact that back in 1945 in july uh when

776
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:07,360
before we had even dropped the bombs on her ocean in nagasaki while they were experimenting

777
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:15,040
with the nuclear bomb uh out in the desert at ala migordo and white flats uh that in uh new

778
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:22,320
mexico he he in fact was one of the the security officers there uh and he said that they were seeing

779
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:29,120
ufo's he told his grandchildren uh from the from the grave basically on the bit on the little

780
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:35,120
eight millimeter home movie that he had been there and that saw the ufo's and that he took

781
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:40,560
a lunch break to go leave and went off into the hill somewhere to go to lunch and he saw one of

782
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:47,280
the craft that had landed uh it had been somehow disabled by the radar that was up all around

783
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:53,600
the proving grounds uh and that he had a direct contact with the ufo occupants of the vehicle

784
01:19:53,760 --> 01:20:01,120
and they they communicated to him telepathically to please take down the radar just temporarily

785
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:07,760
to allow them to flee uh and he actually did that he told his grandchildren he went back

786
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:14,720
and as a range officer ordered them to shut down the the radar for just a short time to do some kind

787
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:22,320
of recalibration of it and at that point the ufo craft fled uh shot off into the sky now that's

788
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:28,960
that's corso talking to his grandchildren in a in a private never intended to be made public

789
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:36,080
uh eight millimeter film and so i found that quite convincing about corso uh so when corso

790
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:42,080
reports that he was actually put into possession of some of the technology that had been recovered

791
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:47,760
from the raswell crash i tend to give it a considerable amount of credibility and the

792
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:54,960
fact that the the various uh aerospace uh corporations tried to set forth some sort

793
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:00,000
of a long explanation about how they really developed the silicon chip they really developed

794
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:06,320
the fiber optics they really developed uh the other uh technology that corso attributes to the

795
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:11,840
raswell crash that's exactly what they would do there's not any doubt about it that they would

796
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,640
obfuscate and they would try to construct some sort of an alternative explanation for how they

797
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:23,120
developed themselves this technology and so i'm just saying that uh i find the corso uh a

798
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:29,680
testimony more credible than many people do i must be very clear here how shehan is indeed

799
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:35,200
incorrect about the 1945 date corso claimed this event occurred when commander of the ballistic

800
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:42,720
missile firing range at red canyon part of white sands this station was in 1957 to 1958 my issue

801
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:49,440
here is this is a truly consequential encounter if true initially i believed this passage to be a

802
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:55,040
dream or metaphor until i read more about how many others corso would tell this story to

803
01:21:55,040 --> 01:22:01,120
unfortunately this is an issue that plagues much of the ufo realm witnesses stating disclosures then

804
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:06,800
adding well and then this happened and then that happened far after their initial disclosures one

805
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:12,320
would imagine such an intimate encounter with a non-human intelligence biologic would be featured

806
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:18,000
in most of corso's disclosures make of this passage what you will however it does leave

807
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,160
somewhat of a sour taste in my mouth that such a dramatic encounter is relegated to the very back

808
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:31,760
part of his manuscript hey guys it's uap kerb thank you so much for joining me as we took this 90 plus

809
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:38,080
around 90 minute deep dive into the claims of lieutenant colonel philip j corso now before we

810
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:43,040
get started and kind of give this conclusion a lot of the time you'll see corso mentioned as

811
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:48,240
colonel philip j corso i have never once been able to verify that corso was indeed a full bird

812
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:53,920
colonel so thus i try to stay true to what i know as fact and what i've seen on his military records

813
01:22:53,920 --> 01:23:00,160
and call him lieutenant colonel philip j corso so the reason i took on this project quite often

814
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:06,720
i'll see people either pro corso or anti corso and much of their arguments crux on the day after

815
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:13,200
roswell book a lot of the people who disregard corso or put away his claims have a unsavory taste

816
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:18,560
in their mouth from the day after roswell whether that be to some of the unsubstantiated and wild

817
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:26,080
claims such as um corso forcing a cia guy to self-delete or some of the egotistical megalomania of

818
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,680
corso in the day after roswell book about him being a world savior and just some of the uh perfect

819
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:37,120
synchronicities of you know perfect descriptions of the roswell crash and rosco hillencoder and

820
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:43,120
the majestic 12 so i wanted to take a step back and read the pure manuscript dawn of a new age

821
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:49,280
of corso this is a 176 page manuscript if you ever watch this video again if you're interested

822
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:54,960
i do recommend reading the full thing however it is a very dreadful read most things are talked about

823
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:01,280
eight or nine times throughout the manuscript so it can just be a trudge to get through now i

824
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:08,560
do notice that there are still some differences between corso's affidavit and the dawn of a new age

825
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:15,280
manuscript and this being the description of the encounter at white sands in 57 and 58 which we

826
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:19,200
just touched on in the end of the video of encountering a non-human intelligence with

827
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:25,600
almost a different physiognomy to the bean he claimed to have seen at fort riley in 1947 so

828
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:32,320
that that description still leaves a bit of a strange taste in my mouth due to reading it

829
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:38,800
after about 120 140 pages into the manuscript at first like i mentioned i did think it was

830
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:44,400
a metaphor a new world if you could take it something to teach his grandchildren to learn from

831
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:51,200
but corso is alleging that this is a true incident he not only wrote this in a film in his manuscript

832
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:57,440
in a film to his grandkids that somehow she hand saw but also told john b alexander joc velay and

833
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:03,440
george nap about this experience so let's kind of dive into some of the things i found very

834
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:08,400
interesting because i do think there's a lot of very credible statements made in the manuscript now

835
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:13,600
i cannot speak to the veracity of the technology ceding claims um i'm not an expert in integrated

836
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,760
circuitry i'm not an expert in computer science i'm not even an expert in metallurgy that was one of

837
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:23,680
my worst classes material science in the university so i cannot speak to that that is why i tried to

838
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:29,120
put a balanced take of course those claims and some traditional history but what we can speak on is

839
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:34,960
some of the factual accuracies of us army r&d at the time you know i know we analyzed that primer

840
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:41,600
quite a bit so it was fascinating to see kind of the army's need for a centralized r&d project

841
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:47,600
under trudeau spearheaded in 1958 just like corso said that's when the golden age of army r&d

842
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:53,360
began it was also very interesting to see back in the late fifties and early sixties the us army

843
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:58,400
was trying to kind of get with semi-private institutions and universities in order to um

844
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:04,080
flourish under army r&d this is something that we talked about quite often f of rdc's and ua rc's

845
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:09,040
and reverse engineering programs and legacy programs utilizing these sorts of institutions for

846
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:16,480
probably material study uh and so forth and also the foreign technology division this is

847
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:21,360
something i think is one of the most crucial aspects of this video that i've seen almost

848
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:27,440
nobody else talk about the foreign technology division under which corso worked was us army

849
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:34,400
not air force this is not the infamous foreign technology division out of right pat now we can

850
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:40,240
ask ourselves why is there no information about this foreign technology division why can we see

851
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:47,440
nothing about it except in the actual military documents under corso uh i myself have some foya

852
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:52,000
documents out to try to investigate for this further but as we've known with the interplanetary

853
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,000
phenomenon unit with the us army there are some weird institutions that somehow exist through

854
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,200
institutional memory i'll be interested in to see if i can pry anything free from foya regarding

855
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:08,880
the army's foreign technology division however my hopes aren't necessarily high that being that if

856
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:14,640
this was indeed one of the first structured us legacy programs i'm sure we'll get no information

857
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:22,720
and i do want to touch on that because if corso's claims are indeed true and i look favorably upon

858
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:27,520
the claims of corso we'll just say that there's some claims that still bewilder me like the

859
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:35,600
nhi encounter and so forth but this program started in 1960 would likely be one of the first

860
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:42,000
structured us legacy programs utilizing corporations you know bell labs and some of the fortune 500

861
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:48,800
companies as well as universities and semi-private institutions so if these disclosures and testimonies

862
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:55,120
are indeed fact we can extract a lot of interesting data and worthwhile investigation here seeing how

863
01:27:55,120 --> 01:28:00,720
legacy programs were structured and framework and that is something that could extend to today which

864
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:06,800
i find highly likely seen as i do believe in modern day or at least the early 2000s the army's role

865
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:14,080
in legacy programs has often been r&d to try and equip the modern warfighter with um reverse

866
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:18,480
engineer technologies of unknown origin there will be a lot more to discuss on that in the future and

867
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:23,520
hopefully as we move on over time we can try and crack into some of these legacy programs and and

868
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:31,440
talking exactly what about the army air force navy does and what contractors work under them and so

869
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:36,880
forth speaking of contractors sperry rand wasn't that an interesting details the memoirs of trudeau

870
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:43,760
and discussed by corso one of the one of the companies they met with often was sperry rand and

871
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:48,480
when sperry rand went defunct i'm doing this off the top of my head which i believe was 86

872
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:56,640
much of their information and engineering divisions were bought up by rathion northrop honeywell

873
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:02,960
and i believe rathion as well as bell labs i think one of the most interesting connections here

874
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:11,520
is bell labs being owned by atn t who in turn owned san had ownership of sandia national labs

875
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:17,120
under mandate by truman sandia is a usual suspect mentioned in the majestic documents mentioned by

876
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:22,240
edgar fuchsia mentioned in the interplanetary phenomenon unit documents that are still disputed

877
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:28,800
to this day so there's a lot of interesting data here to kind of analyze a hypothetical or very

878
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:35,120
much real us army reverse engineering program and speaking of that i'm also so fascinated by

879
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:40,880
corso's discussion of the ufo working group wasn't that interesting mentioning the cia

880
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,600
directorate of science and technology having a major position on this group of about 17

881
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:51,200
18 people on the board as we know with the work of chris sharp thank you chris sharp if you ever

882
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:57,600
watch one of my videos i'm honored you're you're an inspiration but that in 2003 cia oga served as

883
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,960
a logistics coordinator for ufo crash retrieval with the help of jsoc as we have just analyzed

884
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:08,000
the cia directorate of science and technology doug wolf spawned the oga and then us army

885
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:13,760
inscom and founder major albert major general albert stubble bind who corso said funded

886
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:20,400
the ufo working group under inscom in 2003 the isa the intelligent support activity

887
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:28,640
known sometimes as the activity the most clandestine of jsoc units was given over to jsoc and this was

888
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:34,800
all in 2003 around the time of the oga's creation which is allegedly the time the oga served as

889
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:40,080
logistics coordinator for crash retrieval if you don't know much about the isa i highly recommend

890
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:46,960
watching some videos on them they are some uh true bad people in terms of just their training and so

891
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:52,080
forth are really interesting i'm always interested in learning more about jsoc but i do want to know

892
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:57,040
what everybody thought about the video and corso after analyzing his claims in a vacuum purely

893
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,920
analyzing his claims without any of the nonsense and extracurriculars from day after roswell what

894
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:07,120
does everybody think let's get a discussion going if you do not know i have a discord come join that

895
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,880
i'll have the link in the description uh we'll probably have some conversations going on about

896
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,360
corso and so forth because i would really like to talk about that if anybody has any experience

897
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:20,560
or other information on the foreign technology division let's get talking because i think that

898
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:28,160
if you take one single thing away from this video i i would like it to be that the army had an rnd

899
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:34,000
program in the 1960s called the foreign technology division that there are no documents and no

900
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:39,520
data for all we know is that trudeau followed upon his retirement in 62 by dwight e beach forced our

901
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:44,800
general um we're in command of us army are indeed the office of the chief of army research and

902
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:50,000
development so there are some kind of clues there for us to work on further but i hope everybody

903
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,240
