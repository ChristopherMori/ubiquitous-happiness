0	19680	Your Army's Research and Development Program is a continuing effort to help ensure the survival
19680	25640	of this nation. Army Industry Teamwork is essential to the accomplishment of the Army
25640	32320	Research and Development mission. To maintain superiority in our military arsenal, new ideas
32320	40200	are essential. New weapons must be developed and perfected to meet new requirements. In these days
40200	46400	of explosive advances in science and technology, Army Research and Development plays a major role
46400	55480	in maintaining America's military supremacy. You are saying to the human race for the first
55840	63240	time, an official intelligence representative at a high level from the US government is saying
63240	70160	publicly, we are not alone. We're definitely not alone. Absolutely the data points empirically
70160	78960	that we're not alone, yeah. You've said that we have the United States has spacecraft, intact
79400	87960	craft. Do we have bodies? Do we have species? Well, naturally when you recover something that's
87960	99840	either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter dead pilots. Well, the book is really my experience
99840	106320	of as I lived them and research and development of the Army under General Trudeau, Arthur Trudeau,
107040	110320	when he drew me back in and put me in charge of that and established the Florida Technology
110320	118880	Division for me. These were the artifacts from the crash flying saucer, which we used the word
118880	124560	applied engineering. Dr. Tello is still alive, knows he helped him. We fed these things. He gave
124560	130480	me the job of finding industry or scientists that were close to these items and feed us to
130560	134480	them in normal R&D projects. And you're saying these items came from somewhere else. They came
134480	140160	from a flying saucer. How do you know that? Because they were marked in the files that's coming
140160	145360	from New Mexico. Roswell. Yeah, Roswell. Well, I think some came in might be another crash,
145360	151600	but these were came from New Mexico and Roswell especially. And the General Trudeau gave me the
151600	158640	job of working out a program, put these things out, feed them to industry, but there is provisions
158640	165040	feeding it. They can have the patents, but they had to feed them out back to our house as a competitive
165040	172400	edge of the Army and to the American people and the world as necessary. Before the 2023 congressional
172400	178560	hearings on UAP, before the Schumer legislation and before Grush, the 20th century saw a decorated
178560	183920	Lieutenant Colonel of the US Army speak and sign affidavits on the existence of non-human
183920	190720	intelligence, crashed UAP, and exploitation of technologies of unknown origin. The legendary
190720	196640	Philip J. Corso in his infamous book The Day After Roswell and lesser known but far more impactful
196640	202960	manuscript Dawn of a New Age have cemented Corso as one of the most controversial yet credible UFO
202960	208800	whistleblowers of all time. Lieutenant Colonel Corso central claims revolve around his time in
208800	214320	the US Army serving as the chief of the foreign technology division where he claims he not only
214320	221040	came in contact with autopsy reports of extraterrestrial beings but also craft and artifacts from UAP
221040	227200	crashes and discussed how under his command technologies found in UAP were seated into US
227200	233920	industry to give the army a competitive edge. But are Corso's grand and epic claims indeed true?
233920	239440	And what can we learn from these claims? What valuable research can be extracted from the names,
239440	245920	locations, agencies, incidents, and technologies mentioned by the late Corso? Hey guys it's UAP
245920	251280	Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me as we fully analyze and deconstruct the testimony of
251280	258320	Philip J. Corso in his claims of UAP crash retrieval, NHI biologics, and reverse engineering of
258320	264160	exotic technologies. Let's conduct a comprehensive deep dive into Corso ranging from carefully
264160	269120	analyzing statements made in his manuscript to digging through his military record and grand
269120	275520	claims. And some quick bookkeeping before we get started today. We are taking the global best seller
275520	280560	the day after Roswell co-written by Corso and throwing it out the window. We will instead
280560	286480	be focusing solely on Dawn of a New Age. The original notes and manuscript of Corso released
286480	295120	in Italy in 2003 and the US in 2011 after Corso's death in 1998 at the age of 83. We will do this
295120	299920	so we can directly study Corso's pure claims without the creative liberties taken in the
299920	306080	day after Roswell, possibly inserted by the other co-writer Bill Burns. According to Corso's son
306080	311840	Philip Jr. he originally had no plans to release his father's manuscript but did due to his father's
311840	317600	distaste for the best seller. As relayed by Jr. Corso went through the day after Roswell and
317600	323440	highlighted everything he did not say or did not like. He got solely halfway through before giving
323440	328560	up due to frustration with the book. Multiple individuals were privy to the manuscript before
328560	334400	Corso's death such as Colonel John B. Alexander who remarked on sensational details featured in
334400	339440	the book missing in the manuscript. Due to the existence of the manuscript and Corso's son's
339440	343680	firm remarks of releasing the piece to correct the mistakes in the book that made his father
343680	347840	furious during his lifetime, we must give Corso the benefit of the doubt and study
347840	354000	solely his unfiltered words. For example, the day after Roswell is 130 pages longer than
354000	359680	Dawn of a New Age whilst the two cover roughly the same concepts. Day after Roswell adds in details
359680	365040	like recounting the time when Corso intimidated the CIA director of covert operations into
365200	370880	self-deleting, the manuscript features no such tale. Another example is the book originally
370880	376160	shipped with a forward written by U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond who angrily recounted his statements
376160	381920	once learning the book centered on UAP leading to an early copy reprint. While the manuscript makes
381920	387600	mention of Corso's relationship to Thurmond no such advocation by the senator was ever mentioned.
387600	392720	A final example I'll discuss is the missing first chapter from the book, The Roswell Desert,
392720	398880	which describes the Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash in painstaking detail and passes it off as an
398880	404240	accurate description even though Corso was not present at this event. So feel free to visit
404240	409600	the video description and download both the book and the manuscript and follow along as we dive into
409600	421120	the claims of Corso. Philip Corso has as ironclad a background in the U.S. armed forces and military
421120	426480	intelligence as does David Grush. Few other witnesses even with proven accolades in the U.S.
426480	431920	military such as Roswell witness Walter Hott of the 509th bomb group come close to matching
431920	438400	Corso's rank, stations and history. Lieutenant Colonel Corso served in the U.S. Army from February
438400	446240	23, 1942 to March 1, 1963. The young man initially served in military intelligence during Europe in
446240	451840	World War II before becoming chief of the U.S. Counterintelligence Corps CIC in Rome.
451840	456320	At the end of the Second World War, Corso arranged safe passage for numerous Jewish
456320	461920	refugees out of Rome and served as personal emissary to Giovanni Battista Montini who would
461920	468880	become Pope Paul VI. Corso also served diligently in the early 1950s throughout the Korean War,
468880	474320	performing intelligence directly under General Douglas MacArthur as chief of the special projects
474320	479360	branch of the Intelligence Division Far East Command. His work here would focus mainly on
479360	485280	prisoners of war, POWs, and missing in action MIA soldiers during the war, tasked with investigating
485280	492000	North Korean POW camps and investigating the number of U.S. and U.N. POWs held at each camp.
492000	498000	Phil would even testify in 1992 before the Senate Select Committee on POW-MIA Affairs on
498000	503280	hundreds of American soldiers being abandoned at these camps. Corso served on the staff of
503360	509600	President Eisenhower's National Security Council for four years from 1953 to 1957.
509600	514640	Skeptics and detractors of Corso claimed he was never a member of this NSC under Eisenhower,
514640	519360	however. The 1992 Senate Select Committee hearing report would say otherwise,
519360	526160	where the retired Lieutenant Colonel was clearly listed as NSC staff under the Eisenhower administration.
526160	531440	We can also analyze Corso's own FOIAd military documents which show him as a member of the
531440	537520	Operations Coordinating Board, a U.S. secret covert operations committee established in 1952
537520	545360	by Eisenhower under Executive Order 10483, which reported directly to the National Security Council.
545360	550720	In 1960, Corso joined and shortly became commander of the Army's Pentagon-based
550720	555360	Research and Development Program, the illustrious foreign technology division,
555360	560880	under Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau. This foreign technology division is not
560880	565840	the Air Force's infamous foreign technology division born out of the Air Force Technical
565840	570640	Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This program stems from the
570640	577200	Office of the Chief of Army R&D and has almost zero trace or record outside of Corso's own
577200	582720	military documents, and we'll discuss this much further later on. I do briefly want to mention
582720	588160	some interesting context to lend to the credibility of Corso as we dive into his claims.
588160	592560	Viewers of my channel will know of my recent interview with Dr. Eric Davis of the Wilson
592560	598720	Davis Memo, where Davis intimately discussed President and former CIA director George H.W.
598720	604080	Bush's involvement with UAP legacy programs. Well, let's reference Jacques Valais' book,
604080	608400	Forbidden Science Pacific Heights, which speaks on Eric Davis and former President
608400	613600	Bush Senior's professional relationship. After a candid call initiated by Bush giving
613600	619040	Davis advice on his future career, the two spoke again and saw Davis ask Bush about his
619040	624880	interest in Corso's disclosures. Quote, could it be that Corso was mistaken in dealing with
624880	630080	the material he was handling? Could that have been Nazi hardware? End quote. Shockingly,
630080	636160	to the statement on Corso, Bush replied, quote, impossible. The two topics were clearly separated.
636160	641680	By that time, all German secrets had been processed and filed away. They were not used
641680	648000	as cover for anything else. End quote. Bush expanded on the 1954 alleged landing of non-human
648000	653760	intelligence at Holloman Air Force Base, where allegedly Eisenhower and NHI brokered a deal.
653760	659120	According to Bush, this event really did happen, resulting in a secret project with obscene
659120	664960	security. When the two spoke again, Bush told Davis he was briefed on legacy programs by Trudeau
664960	670640	at the time of the 1968 Mandel River's congressional hearings. The book says Colonel
670640	676080	Trudeau, however, I do think this is a typo referencing General Arthur Trudeau. Bush senior
676080	681440	claimed Trudeau told him his man Corso had been asked to testify before Congress and was able to
681440	688400	reveal rumblings of alien hardware that had been distributed to industrial labs. The Corso testimony
688400	694880	was squashed as a result of this conversation. And lastly, why did Corso wait until the 1990s
694880	700400	to disclose his experiences with UAP technology? Well, this is because he made a promise to
700400	705760	Trudeau. He would wait to speak until his death. What about the few people who are have criticized
705760	709120	you to say, well, why are you coming out now? You're violating your security oath. What do you
709120	716320	tell us? I've been asked that question many, many times. Number one is I had a nose with a general
716880	722480	till we won't discuss this. A general said, when I die, feel your release from your oath.
723280	730560	He died three years ago, and I started to write it. Number two is I couldn't talk about people
731200	736320	over with us that I had no right to talk about. In intelligence, like a newspaper man,
737680	743440	your source is not named unless he gives you permission to name him. I had no right to do that.
744960	751200	And so my own family cruise on my son says, 35 years, you didn't talk. You didn't even tell us.
751200	756080	So that's right. Why did I tell anybody? I had an oath was an honorable man, a great man.
757120	761600	And I wasn't about to betray that oath. And not enough knowing that I had never
761600	766560	any intention of writing a book or put that on paper. And there were in my mind a nice
766560	772480	moment there. I never thought I'd write a book or even get a new movie on it. That never entered my head.
772720	779040	Number two is I couldn't talk about people over with us that I had no right to talk about.
779040	785280	Shortly before his death in July of 1998, CAUS, Citizens Against UFO Secrecy,
785280	790480	published an affidavit released by Colonel Corso. This affidavit was signed for
790480	796880	attorney Peter A. Gersten of CAUS in order to file a lawsuit against the Department of Army.
797760	804800	This affidavit reads, quote, I, Colonel Philip J. Corso, retired, do hereby swear under the
804800	810560	penalties of perjury that the following statements are true, that all times here and after mentioned,
810560	815200	I was a member and officer of the defendant, that during my tenure with the defendant,
815200	820160	I was a member of President Eisenhower's National Security Council and former head
820160	824800	of the foreign technology desk at defendant's research and development department,
824800	830160	that on or about July 6th, 1947, while stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas,
830160	836160	I personally observed a four-foot non-human creature with bizarre-looking four-fingered hands,
836160	840880	thin legs and feet, and an oversized incandescent lightbulb-shaped head.
840880	846640	The eye sockets were oversized and almond-shaped and pointed down to its tiny nose. The creature's
846640	851440	skull was overgrown to the point where all its facial features were arranged frontally,
851440	855600	occupying only a small circle on the lower part of the head.
855600	860560	There were no eyebrows or any indications of facial hair. The creature had only a tiny flat
860560	866480	slit for a mouth and it was completely closed, resembling more of a crease or indentation between
866480	873520	the nose and bottom of the chinless skull than a fully functioning orifice. That in 1961, I came
873520	879920	into possession of what I refer to as the Roswell file. This file contained field reports, medical
880000	885360	autopsy reports, and technical debris from the crash of an extraterrestrial vehicle
885360	891360	in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. That I have personally read the medical autopsy reports,
891360	896960	which refer to the autopsy of the previously described creature that I saw in 1947 at Fort
896960	903280	Riley, Kansas. That the autopsy reports indicated the autopsy was performed at Walter Reed Hospital,
903280	908560	which was under the authority of the defendant at the time of the autopsy. That the autopsy report
908560	914160	referred to the creature as an extraterrestrial biological entity. Right off the bat here,
914160	919920	it sounds extreme Corso claimed to have observed a mangled body he would later learn was a deceased
919920	926720	bean from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash. If you are not well versed with the July 1947
926720	932560	Roswell UAP crash retrieval, I do recommend doing some homework before continuing with this project.
932560	938320	I'd recommend the Roswell cover up 75 years later, as well as my project UFO whistleblowers
938320	943200	volume one to hear from some credible whistleblowers on the incident. For this video, we will be
943200	948480	utilizing an array of interesting depictions of the crashed Roswell saucer. Based on reports
948480	954240	and eyewitness testimony, Corso solely labeled the craft as the Roswell crashed saucer in dawn
954240	960320	of a new age. We will explore all of these craft design in a future project solely focused on Roswell.
960800	967520	One night, I was a post duty officer. Post duty officer means that I was in control. For that
967520	973120	night, I was the one who checked all the guards, checked all security areas, fact checked the
973120	980000	whole post. I was a duty officer that night. And I went to the veterinarian section and one of
981360	986400	a sergeant I knew very well was Sergeant of the Guard that night. I told him,
986400	990240	Sarge, how's everything around here? And he said, fine, sir. I told him, you know,
990880	994960	they told me to be careful to watch this area because you have a sense of something sensitive
994960	1000880	here. He said, you want to see it, sir? I told him, yeah, let's go look. And I knew this sergeant,
1000880	1006880	where he was a master sergeant. I went back and there was five crates there, like five or six,
1006880	1011200	I think it was five. I listed one up and here's this body there and floating in food.
1011280	1020880	And I looked at it about 10, 15 seconds, not much more than that. So I put it back down and said,
1020880	1025920	Sarge, come on, get out of here now. I want to get you in trouble. Because I'm the duty officer,
1025920	1031360	I can go around, walk around here. But you might get in trouble for coming back. Just come on,
1031360	1038000	let's go, come out with me. So we went out and I told him, where did it come from, Sarge? He said,
1038080	1045600	well, five trucks came through here from an airfield in New Mexico, and they're heading for
1045600	1051760	Wright, Paterson Air Force. Now, in those days, I wanted all these big roads now. In those days,
1051760	1057120	Route 40 was about the only cross-country route. And the route that they took was Route 40,
1057840	1061280	going through Fort Raleigh, Kansas, and then up to Wright, Paterson Air Force.
1062320	1065280	And I said, well, stay away from the sergeant. I don't want you to get in any trouble.
1066080	1071680	I told him, I can walk around and see them. So, and I started to figure, what was that?
1072720	1078960	First, I thought it was a child, because it was small. Then I looked at this head and all,
1079760	1085520	right away, and this was only half of the matter, secondly. Then I put the end back down, and
1087360	1090960	the head was different. The arms were spindly, the body, it was gray.
1091280	1096880	So, right at that moment, I figured, I don't know what this thing is.
1097440	1101760	Corso's official records do indeed place him at Fort Raleigh at this date,
1101760	1105360	and he would claim he was told the convoy of trucks hauling the bodies were headed
1105360	1110560	for Wright, Pat, and came from Route 40. This is very interesting, as quite often Roswell
1110560	1115280	reports state wreckage was flown to Wright, Paterson Air Force Base, were deceased by
1115360	1121440	logics transported separately, and if so, why? Myriad UFO crash retrieval stories feature
1121440	1126720	flatbed Air Force and Army trucks hauling wreckage away, such as the 1953 Kingman and
1126720	1132240	1965 Kecksburg crash retrievals. Also an interesting line, I'm sure many picked up.
1132240	1137520	The body was referred to as an EBE, extraterrestrial biological entity,
1137520	1143440	the same phrase used in the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual. This manual describes two
1143440	1151120	sets of EBE, EBE 1 and 2. EBE 1 closely matches the description of Corso's observed body.
1151120	1155760	This affidavit provides little more information than Corso gaining first-hand knowledge of the
1155760	1160320	Roswell crash, but fortunately we have his entire manuscript to study.
1165440	1170160	Just to revisit, the bulk of Corso's testimony revolves around the U.S. Army's foreign
1170160	1177360	technology division serving to exploit technology of unknown origin, TuO, from crashed UAP and seeded
1177360	1183600	into U.S. industry to primarily bolster the U.S. Army war machine and, as a second directive,
1183600	1189200	benefit the U.S. economy. Through this program, we start feeding it out to industry, but this was
1189200	1196000	not on paper. They went out as normal research and development proposals, not to name something.
1196000	1199360	Yeah, you didn't put out a report that said there's some alien stuff figured out.
1199360	1203120	We put our regular research and development proposal that came from somebody's brain,
1203920	1208720	and also this was known among a select few, mostly combat officers head-to-head.
1209840	1216000	It came, we kept this among ourselves, because otherwise we were certain that they were
1216000	1219920	destroyed our organization and we had a good organization, General Trudeau pulled it together
1219920	1224240	just a couple years before. They were destroyed our organization and labeled us as kooks and
1224240	1230960	taken our budget away. So, it had to be. We didn't cover because we gave it to industry
1230960	1236400	what the provisions, and I'll repeat this, the provisions were to come back to us with what
1236400	1240480	you prove, competitive edge of the army, give it to the people and to the world if necessary,
1240480	1248080	and take the patents. This claim dating to 1962 parallels extremely closely the modern-day
1248080	1253840	disclosures that branches of U.S. military work closely with contractors under unacknowledged
1254320	1259600	special access program in order to exploit technologies of unknown origin to primarily
1259600	1265600	benefit the U.S. military. Let's monitor this evolution closely as we explore CORSO. It is
1265600	1271280	endlessly fascinating to compare the secrecy and centralization of technology exploitation programs
1271280	1276720	under the foreign technology division as outlined by CORSO. All the way to how these UAP legacy
1276720	1281680	programs may operate today, stove piped and protected from congressional oversight nestled
1281680	1287280	within various intelligence agencies and military institution in league with defense contractors,
1287280	1293760	UARCs, and FFRDCs. Anyways, to the memo. After a brief forward and acknowledgement with the
1293760	1299040	awesome statement quote, if one passage in these memoirs helps you survive in a troubled world,
1299040	1304800	then all this work is not in vain end quote. CORSO begins an introduction for the reader.
1304800	1309360	Philip begins by giving the reader valuable insight into the creation of army research and
1309360	1314240	development projects exploiting technologies of unknown origin. And guys moving forward,
1314240	1318720	research and development will now be shortened to R&D and technologies of unknown origin will
1318720	1324640	be shortened to TUOs. This sort of inception of a legacy UAP program gives us a framework to
1324640	1330560	understand the construction and evolution of such programs. CORSO also quotes the father of German
1330560	1336720	rocketry, flying saucer researcher and mentor of Werner von Braun, Hermann Oberth, who once stated
1336720	1341920	quote, we cannot take the credit for our record advancements and certain scientific fields alone.
1341920	1348960	We have been helped by people of other worlds and quote, 1947 to 1958 saw the disorganized
1348960	1355120	dark ages of army research and development. NASA was founded in 1958, killing the army and DOD
1355120	1360640	project horizon, which served to build a moon base. Atomic energy was stripped from the army and
1360640	1365680	handed over to the Atomic Energy Commission. ARPA, the advanced project research agency,
1365680	1372960	was also founded clashing often with army R&D. It wasn't until 1958, all army R&D was pulled
1372960	1378320	under one single department, the office of the chief of army R&D. This was Lieutenant General
1378320	1384400	Arthur Trudeau, who handled all personnel, tech services, laboratory and installations as well
1384400	1390320	as budget. Trudeau would then create the foreign technology division and designate young CORSO
1390320	1396080	as its chief. CORSO would take quote, all reports on foreign technology, which included foreign
1396080	1402160	beans and events, those not of this world and quote, we will discuss this station and division
1402160	1406400	in much greater detail later in the project. But for now, we are focusing solely on the
1406400	1414080	manuscript's introduction. This led according to CORSO to the golden age of army R&D from 58 to 63.
1414080	1418400	However, in this time, the army still faced many challenges impeding their work,
1418400	1425200	civilian control of space efforts, DoD opposers, adverse policy guidance and the animosity of
1425200	1432080	CIA Department of State. This would all lead to the hyper secrecy of all R&D data pertaining to
1432080	1437920	areas out of this world. All of these materials were compartmentalized and trusted amongst a select
1437920	1443600	few quote, great efforts were made to bring large industry and select laboratories into the army
1443600	1449680	R&D fold, end quote. CORSO also states quote, the partners we sought and gathered were US industry,
1449680	1455040	a strong laboratory support and many leading universities, end quote. I do believe this small
1455040	1460160	line is one of the most crucial aspects of CORSO's testimony, believe it or not. Quite often on this
1460160	1465840	channel, we talk not only about contractors involved in UAP legacy programs, but also university
1465840	1471840	affiliated research centers, as well as federally funded research and development centers, semi private
1471840	1478080	institutions. One such organization created during this golden age of army R&D is an FFRDC,
1478080	1484640	I believe is up to their eyeballs in UAP legacy programs, MITRE. Officially established in 1958,
1484640	1490640	MITRE was created by MIT Lincoln Labs employees, creating SAGE, the semi automatic ground
1490640	1495680	environment program to coordinate radars to produce imageries of airspace for the military.
1495680	1501040	A thesis I'd like to keep in mind during this exploration was the MITRE FFRDC created in part
1501040	1507280	to fulfill the need of army UFO R&D to see technology into US industry. Of course the foreign
1507280	1512800	technology division was created a year later in 1960, however CORSO does state before his station
1512800	1518640	at the new office, material exploitation efforts by the army had been ongoing since Roswell. At
1518640	1523360	an undisclosed date, but presumably around the time or just before the creation of the foreign
1523360	1530720	technology division in 1960, CORSO states the top 25 industries on the Fortune 500 list were contacted
1530720	1535920	and meetings were arranged with their board of directors, top personnel with the chiefs of army
1535920	1541600	R&D. Laboratories were strengthened and organized, gathering funds to attract the best and brightest
1541600	1546960	including foreign scientists such as those brought from Operation Paperclip. With contractors such as
1546960	1551440	Bell Labs, who is credited with the development of the transistor and laser, two technologies
1551440	1557920	CORSO said were leveraged from UAP alongside universities and army laboratories. This conglomeration,
1558000	1564160	a powerful team, was tasked with exploiting TUOs. The guiding principle of this army project had
1564160	1570000	but two goals, national security of the United States and protection of the American way of life.
1570560	1575520	In a rare Art Bell coast-to-coast interview with CORSO and Colonel John B. Alexander,
1575520	1580720	CORSO would state the foreign technology division began to operate with a budget of $2 billion.
1588320	1593520	They weren't doing this gratis or for an investigation, you were commissioning them,
1593520	1599040	you had budget money, research and development money that came along with these items you were
1599040	1603920	giving them. We had a budget then it was tremendous, it was about $2 billion. $2 billion.
1604960	1610480	We also gave out RDTAD contracts, research development tests and evaluation contracts.
1611040	1617840	The first item that would be built from a research contract, we funded the building to the first
1617840	1626240	one and after that other people and other agencies funded it. So we would fund these until it was
1626240	1632640	actually developed. We had our laboratories, our atomic labs and the night viewing labs,
1632640	1638640	where our labs at Fort Bell were. Colonel, what aspect of this were you overseeing? In other
1638640	1644560	words, once you gave somebody a piece of this technology and a budget, what did you then do?
1648960	1656160	This RDT&E funding would equal over $10.5 billion today, quite the starting budget.
1656160	1661440	The mention of R&D test and evaluation contracts reminds me closely of witness Ed,
1661440	1666320	who made claims of a joint UAP reverse engineering group operating between NELIS
1666320	1672320	slash Area 51 and Edwards Air Force bases. After his service in the Edwards 412th group,
1672320	1678480	Ed would work for USAF at the Pentagon serving on acquisition, integration and RDT&E panel.
1678480	1685120	It was here Ed would claim $34 and $40 billion were siphoned off in respective years to non-air
1685120	1691200	force TOA transfer of authority funds. Here in the introduction Corso breaks down some of the
1691200	1695840	breakthroughs leveraged from the foreign technology division and golden age of R&D
1695840	1701280	from studying reports and wreckage from Roswell and possibly other UAP recoveries.
1701280	1706240	Let's go ahead and break these down. The first technology are image intensifiers,
1706240	1712240	aka passive night vision devices. Corso stated the night vision laboratory at Fort Belvoir,
1712240	1718000	Virginia created these first generation devices with aid from 48 US industries,
1718000	1723360	all with varying knowledge of the project. Allegedly information gathered from the 1947
1723440	1728880	Roswell crash led to this breakthrough. Passive systems were indeed constructed by the US Army
1728880	1735040	in the early 1960s. However, many individuals such as Colonel John B. Alexander challenged
1735040	1741120	this statement. One of the most contentious technologies discussed by Corso is fiber optics.
1741120	1746240	This point of Corso's testimony has been highly contentious like much of the materials.
1746240	1751680	Allegedly at Roswell, the recovery team discovered what they thought to be a broken wiring harness
1751760	1758080	with each loose strand and emitting a different color. These wires were fiber optics.
1758080	1763280	Bell Labs allegedly utilized this technology to spearhead the greatest advancements
1763280	1768240	in communication history. Now this point is contentious because French scientists were
1768240	1774400	indeed working on early developments of fiber optic principles in the early 1840s. Bell Labs
1774400	1779280	was involved in the development of fiber optics in the 1970s where they improved the technology
1779280	1784320	and minimized loss on mass scale production. Now let's keep in mind, Corso does say some
1784320	1789600	of the non-human technologies leveraged were used to bolster human technology, so perhaps this
1789600	1794720	drastic Bell Labs improvement is one of these instances. And speaking of Bell Labs, let's
1794720	1800800	remember back to the testimony of Edgar Fouchet, who stated that FFRDC's Livermore Labs and
1800800	1806960	Sandia National Labs reverse engineered the propulsion system for the TR-3B alien reproduction
1806960	1812000	vehicle. According to the Majestic-12 documents in the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit report,
1812000	1818560	Sandia has also served as a prime site for UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering operations.
1818560	1824560	In fact, I have spoken so much about Sandia, I highly recommend committing them and FFRDCs
1824560	1830720	in general to memory. The telephone company AT&T was given managerial responsibilities
1830720	1838000	of Sandia National Labs by President Harry Truman in 1949. As of 1925, Bell Labs and their
1838000	1844240	engineering R&D department was placed under shared ownership of Western Electric and AT&T.
1844240	1850080	Very interesting connections here. Another alleged leverage technology were super tenacity fibers
1850080	1856000	from one single strand of fiber that could not be damaged. The Army at that time, according to Corso,
1856000	1861520	had a tremendous need for fibers, for flak jackets, parachutes, and other military items.
1861520	1865840	Important to note, dawn of a new age states these fibers were utilized to construct
1865840	1871040	composites for stealth technology and civilian aircraft, while day after Roswell states these
1871040	1878240	fibers were used to construct Kevlar, the material in bulletproof vests and made by DuPont in 1965.
1878240	1882960	Strange molecular alignment techniques were additionally studied from the Roswell crash.
1882960	1888480	The craft showed molecules down to individual atoms, had been aligned in various patterns
1888480	1895200	resulting in incredible hardness and resistance to scratches, stress, strain, and shear in metals
1895200	1900800	while all repelling cosmic particles and radiation. The Chief of R&D of the Army thought this to be
1900800	1906880	a truly consequential discovery and thus special teams were organized to investigate this chemistry.
1906880	1912320	Corso stated this atomic rearrangement could lead to incredibly strong yet light spacecraft,
1912320	1918480	but in 1963 and possibly through 1993 the Army had not solved this issue.
1918480	1923680	I personally have heard some similar claims that non-human craft employ materials with
1923680	1930000	interesting atomic arrangements. Corso also believed fluid application was leveraged from UFO
1930000	1935760	propulsion and guidance systems. Fluidic principles led to the creation of the heart pump. Even though
1935760	1941840	fluidic principles are quite old, they were not utilized commercially until about 1960 for the
1941920	1947920	demand for reliable controls in space research. Two of the greatest technologies exploited by
1947920	1953920	Army R&D according to Corso were the transistor and integrated circuit. As we mentioned above,
1953920	1961120	Bell Labs first introduced a point contact transistor in 1947. Jack Kirby of Texas Instruments
1961120	1968000	introduced the first hybrid integrated circuit between 1958 and 1959. Corso's testimony illustrates
1968000	1973840	a strange transistor with hair-like wires and leads and a chip in a stack of thin uniformly
1973840	1979680	shaped wafer-like components found in a crash retrieval. Quote, these formed complete electrical
1979680	1985520	circuits and developed into the micromodule concept. CRD said it would take 50 years to develop the
1985520	1992480	transistor and 200 years to develop the chip. It came in a short span of five years, end quote.
1992480	1998960	Corso does state this development occurred before the Golden Age of Army R&D, 1958 to 1963,
1998960	2005360	with advancements as early as 1947. As he states improvements were made to the existing technologies
2005360	2011760	in 1959 with the introduction of miniaturization of circuits. In fact, when Corso began his service
2011760	2017040	as special assistant to Trudeau in 1960, Trudeau would allegedly show in both transistors and
2017040	2021920	integrated circuits and engage in some philosophical discussion on the implications of harnessing
2021920	2027280	off-world technologies for human use. Perhaps this does indeed adhere to conventional history,
2027280	2033120	which states physicist Julius Edgar Lillianfield proposed the concept of a field effect transistor,
2033120	2039680	an FET, in 1926. But it was not possible to construct a working device at that time. It was
2039680	2046320	not until 1947 we saw application of transistors. The Lieutenant Colonel also stated the laser,
2046320	2051920	who many program members suggested was the EBE's method of communication over vast distances of
2051920	2057760	space was derived from the Roswell crash. As we know, the laser, which stands for light amplification
2057760	2064640	by stimulated emission of radiation, was created in 1960 under Bell Labs. And again, what was the
2064640	2071920	purpose of all of this R&D in Corso's own words, quote, to guarantee a superior competitive position
2072880	2078000	given the superior data by the accidental discovery at Roswell, we reduce scientific data
2078000	2083600	to a definite development to fulfill a military requirement. We never quibbled over who discovered
2083600	2089040	or invented the development. The feeling was if a discovery was adapted to a concrete development,
2089040	2093360	we would all be ahead in the game and the nation would benefit, end quote.
2093360	2099040	This reminds me almost identically of the claims made by David Grush regarding secrecy of legacy
2099040	2103840	program operations. So the reason for the secrecy exactly is what?
2106080	2113840	Feudalistic dominance, who can have both asymmetric technology for, it seems like,
2113840	2120560	just fueling the war machine. Grush says that through the 50s and 60s, encounters with the
2120560	2127040	NHI continued, as did the cover up. Key to mention here, it is stated in the manuscript
2127040	2132960	extraterrestrials never gave humans a thing. Not one scientific advantage came voluntarily.
2132960	2139360	Everything was garnered by accident or perhaps force in some cases. This raises a very interesting
2139360	2144320	point. Numerous individuals such as David Grush have flirted with the subject of agreements with
2144320	2150160	humans and non human intelligence. If these agreements do not involve technology, what do
2150160	2157600	they involve? And it's quite clear that you're talking about agreements between America and
2157600	2163840	non human intelligences. Have we made agreements with non human intelligences?
2165280	2169920	That's the kind of information I really hope national leadership is able to get to the bottom
2169920	2174880	of. I need to pin you down on this. Are there agreements between non human intelligences
2174880	2179920	and the American government? I think that's a question that I would
2181360	2186800	like to know all the details of as well. Or is it possible R&D programs were kept separate from
2186800	2191840	other compartmentalized programs that inherited technology, a separation of programs I believe
2191840	2195840	is active today? I think something that a lot of people don't ask that has kind of captured my
2195840	2199840	attention. During your time investigating legacy programs, did you see much collaboration
2199840	2204640	or compartmentalization between programs that may exist in Navy Air Force Army?
2204640	2210800	It's too snowpiped or compartmentalized. You can't open it up to another one unless there is a need
2210800	2220880	to do that. That need to get access is defined on a government form called the DD-254.
2221840	2230640	And the DD-254 documents who has access and why and what gets access. And if you're going to
2231680	2237200	have to get access to another compartmentalized program, then that has to be justified in the
2237200	2242400	DD-254. And usually that's not justified because programs don't really overlap.
2242400	2247760	However, Corso's claims NHI technology was taken, not inherited, mirrors closely the
2247760	2253920	claims of Fluxliner alien reproduction vehicle witness Brad Sorensen, who was told at the 1988
2253920	2260320	Norton airshow the basis for the ARV the Roswell wreckage was taken without the consent of its
2260320	2266560	operators. Another interesting parallel to today is a contractor Corso makes numerous mentions to,
2266560	2273120	the Sparey Rand Corporation. Not to be confused with the Rand FFRDC, Sparey Rand was a major
2273120	2278720	20th century electronics corporation and military contractor. Sparey Rand was additionally named
2278720	2284160	in General Trudeau's memoirs as a frequent spot for meetings. He would often meet with their CEO
2284160	2290480	and directors to discuss Army R&D projects. One such director was the legendary General Douglas
2290480	2296800	MacArthur. Sparey Rand went defunct in 1986 and many of its divisions became part of Honeywell,
2296800	2302640	Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. Corso then goes on to mention a long list of
2302640	2308320	other benefits garnered from UFO technology exploration. One I want to mention is anti-missile
2308320	2313920	missiles for the Star Wars program. Long have I stated the Star Wars program, formerly known as
2313920	2319760	the Strategic Defense Initiative, had a secondary function to fund UAP programs and act offensively
2319760	2324960	against UAP. There is indeed interesting research to suggest although the program was set in place
2324960	2330880	by Reagan in 1983, Eisenhower established the program for UAP offensive action during his
2330880	2336480	presidency. The Colonel discussed the need for protection against the EBEs themselves. The
2336480	2341920	Lieutenant Colonel stated EBEs have performed acts of war with superior advanced equipment and
2341920	2347520	superior techniques. The threat internally was treated similar to the Soviets as a fig leaf
2347520	2353520	policy where the Soviets and non-human threatened existence but were not considered enemies. These
2353520	2358160	acts included the controversial abduction phenomena and mutilation as well as quote
2358160	2363440	spying on our atomic installations. Hindering missile and space equipment testing, hampering
2363440	2367920	our military deterrent and nuclear deterrent, halting and interfering with exploration of
2367920	2373120	moon and Mars, causing crashes of aircraft and casualties among military personnel and
2373120	2378000	tampering with human and animal genome, end quote. I would like to explore some of these
2378000	2383520	more controversial claims in a future project so let's hold on to this. This passage is key to
2383520	2388640	reflect on as in the revelations of David Grush we have heard people have been hurt and killed by
2388640	2394960	UAP but cannot attribute malicious intent to these intelligences. To conclude with the introduction,
2394960	2400960	Corso placed much admiration for the individuals behind exotic R&D. These veterans of World War
2400960	2405840	II in Korea were entrusted with the United States government's highest level deepest secrets.
2405920	2416000	Now that we have spent over half an hour investigating the introduction of the manuscript,
2416000	2421360	we can start to dive in and explore more of Corso's claims in depth. Throughout the
2421360	2426160	introduction of this document, we heard Corso recount for the reader much of his early military
2426160	2431280	career but quickly let's recap some of his highlights right before he met General Trudeau in
2431280	2440000	his own words. Well your career to the to the point that you meant the general was a very honorable
2441200	2446880	and fairly normal military career. It was in comp at this time because we were fighting the
2446880	2454560	war in North Africa in Italy and then I joined the general. I went to Korea last time. I participated
2454560	2462000	in the Korean War and I joined the counter staff over there and I came back and when I came back to
2462000	2468320	the pages I joined Kevin Heidenhaal as one of the military in the United States with the White House
2469200	2475120	and there my career for the team I was in the White House for four years and from there I took
2475120	2483360	command of of the military defiant, the army's military defying range, the White Vans and then
2483440	2492880	I took the command of the Germans and I became I stayed in command 18 months and then I became
2492880	2498880	Secretary General of the Army and from there I came back to the United States and General Trudeau
2498880	2505280	had reorganized research and development of the army and he sent for me and I joined him as a
2505280	2510720	special assistant and chief of the forces of the division. Corso claimed his military career saw
2510720	2516640	him earn nine clearance levels above top secret up to the coveted eyes only material for the White
2516640	2522720	House NSC matters. Achieving these clearances is when Lieutenant Colonel would claim he became
2522720	2528960	aware of UFO information though nothing pertaining to legacy programs or reverse engineering since
2528960	2536000	his NSC position occurred from 1953 to 1957. We can wager any interesting UFO information was
2536000	2541360	presented to him as Intelligent Staff O for the Operations Coordinating Board attached to the
2541360	2546880	National Security Council. Corso claimed his superior and the President Special Assistant C.D.
2546880	2553280	Jackson along with President Eisenhower himself were the only individuals aware of Corso's clearances.
2553280	2558400	C.D. Jackson here is Charles Douglas Jackson Special Assistant to Eisenhower and Government
2558400	2564400	Psychological Warfare Advisor. Jackson served as liaison between the freshly minted CIA and the
2564400	2569920	Pentagon. Jackson was also a member of the Committee on International Information Activities.
2569920	2575600	Corso did discuss how in officer school he began specializing in air defense and ballistic missiles.
2575600	2579760	Twice during his command of missile units unidentified objects were picked up over New
2579760	2585680	Mexico and Germany traveling at over 3,000 miles per hour. Corso was ordered to destroy
2585680	2591200	any records and tapes. Following service as commander of the 71st Missile Battalion in Germany
2591200	2596240	and Inspector General of the 7th Army, Corso was led to become Special Assistant to the Chief of
2596240	2602720	Army R&D Lieutenant General Arthur G. Trudeau quote. If Edwin Teller could be called the father
2602720	2608000	of the H-Bomb, General Trudeau could be called the father of the ballistic missile end quote.
2608000	2614000	And now we can get into some of the very juicy details. In 1960 Corso entered into his position
2614000	2619840	as Chief of the Foreign Technology Division having seen a small strange body while also being read
2619840	2624960	into some unknown UFO information due to his clearance levels and had been told of some exotic
2624960	2630560	technologies leveraged from off-world technologies by his mentor and boss Arthur Trudeau. But I do
2630560	2636160	find it strange Corso does not write about the 1947 non-human intelligence body encounter in
2636160	2641760	dawn of a new age as we observed and assigned affidavit. This is especially strange because
2641760	2647760	this encounter of biologics was relayed in the book day after Roswell so I guess let's go back
2647760	2652960	and hear this story recounted in Corso's own words. And I was instructor at the intelligence
2652960	2661600	school and we had an aggressor force that I was. Though one night I was post-duty officer. Post-duty
2661600	2667520	officer means that I was in control. For that night I was the one who checked all the guards,
2667520	2672400	checked all security areas, in fact checked the whole post. I was a duty officer that night.
2672560	2680480	And I went to the veterinarian section and one of a sergeant I knew very well was Sergeant of
2680480	2686160	the Guard that night. I told him, Sarge, how's everything around here? And he said, fine, sir.
2686160	2690720	I told him, you know, they told me to be careful to watch this area because you have a sense of
2690720	2695600	something sensitive here. He said, you want to see it, sir? I told him, yeah, let's go look.
2696560	2701200	And I knew this sergeant very, he was a master sergeant. I went back and there was five crates
2701200	2707040	there, like five or six, I think it was five. I listed one up and here's this body there and
2707040	2716720	floating in fluid. And I looked at it about 10, 15 seconds, not much more than that. So I put it
2716720	2721600	back down and said, Sarge, come on, get out of here now. I want to get you in trouble because
2721600	2727040	I'm the duty officer. I can go around and walk around here. But you might get in trouble for
2727040	2733200	coming back. Just come on, let's go, come out with me. So we went out and I told him,
2733200	2736800	where did it come from, Sarge? He said, well, five trucks came through, I'm coming through here
2737840	2743760	from an airfield in New Mexico and they're heading for Wright, Paterson Air Force. Now,
2743760	2750320	in those days, I wanted all these big roads now. In those days, Route 40 was about the only cross
2750320	2756240	country route. And the route that they took was Route 40, going through Fort Raleigh, Kansas,
2756240	2760880	and then up to Wright, Paterson Air Force. And I said, well, stay away from Sarge. I don't want
2760880	2767680	you to get in any trouble. I told him, I can walk around and see. So, and I started to figure,
2767680	2775280	what was that? First, I thought it was a child because it was small. Then I looked at this head
2775280	2780640	and all, right away, and this was only happened a matter of seconds. Then I put the end back down
2781600	2790320	and the head was different. The arms were spindly, the body was gray. So, right at that moment,
2790320	2796560	I figured, I don't know what this thing is. So, like an intelligence business, I just better put
2796560	2802160	it on back of my head here and wait to maybe in the future, I get cooperation so I can evaluate
2802160	2806800	what it is. As Chief of the Foreign Technology Division, the young Lieutenant Colonel would
2806800	2812480	receive, quote, all reports on foreign technology, which included foreign beans and events, those
2812480	2817680	not of this world, end quote. He would spearhead a team of Nazi scientists brought over from
2817680	2823520	Operation Paperclip, as well as US scientists and technicians. Some of these pieces of technology
2823520	2829600	were known to be from crashed UFOs, while others were educated guesses. Corso did recognize his
2829600	2835200	position arose almost exclusively from his close relationship with the infamous Trudeau. In fact,
2835200	2840320	Trudeau personally gave Corso what is now famously known as the Roswell file, a box of
2840320	2843520	materials and files pertaining to the infamous crash.
2865520	2874000	I opened it up and I started finding the material which he called later, Corso's Jump,
2876080	2880720	and there was a bunch of wires, which I didn't know what they were, which were immediately colors.
2880720	2887360	I didn't even know if they were wires. I had this chip, this integrated circuit, a laser instrument.
2888640	2892400	They could do like some of the fine cuttings that they save in manual simulations.
2892960	2904080	And I had also fiber optics and I had those and I recalled them. We started that because
2905040	2911280	one of my, and I had reports on autopsy that performed a law to read on our lab, which we
2911280	2918080	financed the law to read. And when I read that, it matched with what I saw for roughly 14 years
2918080	2926320	before. The whole autopsy was similar, what I'd seen. So then I start putting two and two together
2928080	2931200	and gradually these items will start, and then the general called me and said,
2931200	2936800	work out a program. Find scientists who are working on these things and shove them in there.
2937600	2940800	I told the general, I have to study these things old because really,
2941600	2944960	I told him, I'm not that bright. I don't know what these things and all of these things are,
2945040	2950160	but they're important. He said, well, Phil, they are important. Give me a program what they are.
2950720	2955760	Anyways, after Corso was designated as the chief of the foreign technology division by Trudeau
2955760	2963120	in 1960, Corso was given four subjects to keep track of. One, foreign development of this world.
2963120	2969680	Two, foreign intelligence and developments not of this world. Three, act as interim project
2969680	2976480	officer on select R&D projects and four, all other duties assigned as special assistant
2976480	2982960	to the CRD for the US Army. National security measures meant points one, three and four fell
2982960	2988800	into normal categories, but point two was a whole different matter. Many experts in the
2988800	2994560	know felt the army was helpless in the face of NHI technology. Let's briefly touch on some more
2994560	2999520	technologies and items featured in the Roswell report given to Corso by Trudeau. We have yet to
2999520	3005200	discuss amongst the physical technologies and reports on artifacts such as a paper thin high
3005200	3010320	strength metal found at the Roswell crash. Corso discovered autopsy reports discussing
3010320	3017200	beings almost identical to what he observed in 1947. Accompanying images show decomposed
3017200	3023040	bodies roughly four feet tall and medical reports detailed heavy variations to human anatomy and
3023040	3029600	organs as well as skin and bone composition. These biologics heart and lungs were very large
3029600	3034880	with a remarkably different muscular structure. The beings appear to have skin and bone structure
3034880	3041120	built to protect vital organs from cosmic action, cosmic radiation or gravitational pull.
3041120	3045680	And it is interesting, according to the manuscript, a transparent film over the eyeball
3045680	3051680	of the deceased EBEs led to Trudeau mandating the pursuit of passive night vision technology.
3051760	3057040	Analyzing every single file he had on the Roswell crash saucer, Corso did notice some
3057040	3063440	odd discrepancies between the beans and their craft. The files had no mention of food or nourishment
3063440	3068720	for the beans in the craft nor mention of water or drinking water or water for cleansing the body.
3068720	3073440	The files made no mention to refrigeration equipment, no mention of medical equipment
3073440	3079200	besides what the recovery crew guest was a first aid kit and there was no toilet or waste disposal
3079200	3086160	facilities or no rest and no recreation facilities. Corso and the OCRD believed these beans to be
3086160	3092560	clones or at the very least expendable creatures sent by some sort of intelligence. The chief
3092560	3097520	even believed the Roswell craft to be a reconnaissance craft that would return to a mothership for
3097520	3103520	necessities. The Lieutenant Colonel also reasoned possibly this species had solved gravitational
3103520	3109360	time dimensional travel and could instantaneously return to their base. Throughout the manuscript
3109360	3116480	Corso would often hint at multiple UAP or crashed flying saucers analyzed. It is frustrating we don't
3116480	3123440	get a total count besides confirmation of the Roswell crash as well as the 1947 July San Augustine
3123440	3129680	New Mexico crash in which allegedly a flying saucer crashed with no seams, joint lines,
3129760	3135680	rivets or weld joints. This is a ubiquitous description in almost all UFO crash retrieval
3135680	3141520	reports. So when I start putting all this on the extraterrestrial together and finally gave it a
3141520	3148560	name I told them it looks like you know these are clones and so the name came out extra extraterrestrial
3148560	3154320	biological entity that's what we figured they were better described than we never used the letters
3154320	3161760	ET there was no such thing. He said that they look like clones how they're clones not look like
3161760	3170400	clones they were clones we figured that they were created by some some other intellect and we also
3170400	3178400	came to the decision that they were made to specifically the travel in space because we knew
3178480	3186320	in those days that man could not travel in space some bones are affected his muscles are affected
3186320	3191920	his brain is affected man cannot travel in space so we came to the conclusion that these creatures
3191920	3199520	whatever they are are made to travel in space and gradually through what work we did we found
3199520	3204320	out that disintegrated with the flying saucer and with you because most of the failures making
3204320	3210480	by saucers were the guidance system that this creature was also the guidance system was part
3210480	3215920	of the engine of the flying saucer it is also fascinating to see how the team was inspired
3215920	3221680	and attempted to study harnessing brainwaves to control aircraft and anti-missile missiles
3221680	3227040	this inspiration came from apparent discoveries that these extraterrestrial biological entities
3227040	3232640	were part of the craft's guidance systems this may seem like science fiction however we do live
3232640	3239120	in an age where consciousness connection is indeed discussed with UFO craft piloting and
3239120	3243520	we came to a conclusion even in those days that these were the reason most flying saucers have
3243520	3249680	failed is because our conclusion was that this being is part of the guidance system he's part
3249680	3255120	of that saucer i've just had one of the most senior scientists in the u.s defense department
3256080	3265760	former admit to me that he was read into a ufo crash retrieval program i've spoken to well over
3265760	3275600	20 people now what i was told consistently was the technology is mind-blowing and they are not
3276080	3284640	in a position to be able to engineer it yet because it's just light years beyond what we
3284640	3291920	have it's a completely new type of physics is what one person said to me and you might be interested
3291920	3302160	in this jay because of the sort of direction that your interests have taken without expanding on it
3302480	3309280	expanding on it one of the people i spoke to told me that it had a lot to do with a mind
3309280	3314000	interface connection with the engineering that it was driven by some kind of consciousness or
3314000	3322480	some kind of intelligent connection with machinery that was beyond our understanding
3322480	3328080	shockingly we can add even more context to these claims by analyzing the files of the legendary
3328080	3334080	lennard stringfield and take a look at a report of a possible recovered vehicle or alien reproduction
3334080	3340560	vehicle that utilized headband transceivers to operate quote len spoke to a mr. hines who had
3340560	3345600	a source from bell labs the informants stated that he was on the flight line at a california
3345600	3352160	air force base in the early 1950s and saw a ufo retrieval brought in he allegedly saw a cutaway
3352160	3357840	of the recovered craft plus the headband transceivers worn by the aliens anyone involved with the
3357840	3362800	retrieval was subject to intense scrutiny and search apparently one man must have kept a
3362800	3368800	part of the craft and he mysteriously disappeared he was never seen again the source feels that the
3368800	3374560	man was eliminated end quote chief corso somehow stumbled upon information that the soviets were
3374560	3380800	running their own parallel to you o exploitation program this may have stemmed from soviet spies
3380800	3386880	in new mexico tipping off stalling to the roswell crash where stalling allegedly gathered the ussr's
3386960	3392480	rightus to discuss the captured saucer quote some of the items found and analyzed by the russians
3392480	3397840	possess a similarity of items gathered in the united states others closely resemble material
3397840	3403600	collected by the us army soon after the crash end quote impactful statement as recently dr
3403600	3409280	eric davis confirmed the soviets did indeed observe and collect at least one crash retrieval
3409280	3414800	in their own territory it is unknown how exactly corso came across this intelligence regarding
3414800	3421040	the soviets but it is no surprise after the words of david grush grush says the united states is not
3421040	3428720	the only country that's encountered nhi and their technology he says our geo political rivals have
3428720	3435760	their own crash retrieval programs which they are also secretly exploiting for military purposes
3435760	3441520	we're in a competition with their adversaries to understand this and it's a it's a multi-decade
3441520	3448480	cold war that uh has been under our nose for so long and you know there is no good way to level
3448480	3454480	the playing field and hold other nation states accountable if they're doing unethical or illicit
3454480	3460880	activity as it relates to this subject however far down the line in 1993 corso would ask old
3460880	3466640	acquaintances to acquire about recovered materials from a kgb general while much of the information
3467040	3474560	held as top secret by kgb and gru corso was given a list of materials you can see on screen now
3474560	3480000	let's temper our expectations as this list could easily have been disinformation given to corso
3480000	3486320	however one piece that stands out to me was a silvery tube found in the us in 1975 i wonder
3486320	3492960	if this possibly relates to the august 1974 chiwawa mexico crash i covered in which a us rapid
3493040	3498960	recovery team relieved a deceased mexican army squadron of a recovered craft possibly the soviets
3498960	3504480	traced this recovery and found materials missed by the convoy the foreign technology division
3504480	3510320	was working with lasers anti-missile missiles and directed energy weapons near the tail end of
3510320	3516800	corso's career lieutenant general trudeau retired in 1962 and the lieutenant colonel followed him
3516800	3527920	shortly in 1963 now what more can we learn about the foreign technology division and general
3527920	3533680	arthur trudeau trudeau is a member of the military intelligence hall of fame the general served in
3533680	3539280	world war two in the korean war trudeau served as chief of army intelligence but was relieved by
3539280	3546320	alan dolas director of the cia possibly for his extremely rigorous anti-communist stance the general
3546320	3553520	was shortly reinstated and eventually in 1958 the golden age of army r&d began according to corso
3553520	3559280	trudeau would then return to washington as director of army research and development the general was
3559280	3565520	so influential to the army he was one of eight former generals included in the army's 1970s oral
3565520	3570880	history project funny enough when trudeau was interviewed for this project corso was found
3570880	3576160	to be spending time with his friend trudeau in his kitchen this speaks to the close relationship
3576160	3581920	of the two and their friendship during and after their service and outside of corso we have only
3581920	3587920	one interesting piece to link the general to uap let's remember all the way back to forbidden
3587920	3593840	science where dr eric davis claimed bush senior stated he was indeed briefed by trudeau at the
3593840	3600240	1968 mendel rivers congressional hearings now i'm sure many are familiar with the united
3600240	3606320	states air forces foreign technology division that operated out of right patterson from 1961
3606320	3614800	to 1991 to reiterate the office created by trudeau and chiefed by corso was not this infamous division
3614800	3621520	the air force program evolved from air technical intelligence center in 1961 and was a sign under
3621520	3627600	air force systems command the division reportedly operated on recovered russian mig jets however
3627600	3633120	due to the stove piping of ufo legacy programs it would not be shocking to think perhaps this
3633120	3638960	program also engaged with technologies of unknown origins parallel to its army department
3638960	3646320	let's reference us army colonel john b alexander's book ufo's myths conspiracies and realities
3646320	3652000	i know i've had my problems with alexander before and his discussion of the som 101 majestic
3652000	3658160	12 special operations manual however this quote is important quote corso stated that he had been
3658160	3662800	transferred back to the pentagon under trudeau and a division had been created for him called the
3662800	3668080	foreign technology division this is not to be confused with the large foreign technology division
3668080	3673120	of the u.s air force at right patterson ohio it was learned that the army foreign technology
3673120	3678240	division was formed as corso stated and then disappeared shortly after his retirement end
3678800	3684480	this is a fascinating point as after general trudeau four star general dwight e beach took
3684480	3690880	over command of army rnd and from there on out we find nothing of foreign technology division
3690880	3698160	why is this army rnd office proven to exist yet zero foya documents newspapers or online articles
3698160	3703520	exist about the correct program numerous references can be found to the air forces foreign
3703520	3709520	technology division but not the armies i find this very similar to the army's interplanetary
3709520	3715200	phenomenon unit which was discovered through foya to exist only throughout institutional memory in
3715200	3721440	the army i do believe this inability to track down the army's foreign technology division to be of
3721440	3728160	extreme consequence if corso's testimony is indeed true there is much value we can extract here
3728160	3734880	regarding uap legacy program operations this would mean the office of the chief of army rnd
3734880	3740960	created a very real program hidden and shadowed from the public eye by the publicity of its big
3740960	3746400	air force brother at right patterson throughout the manuscript corso would even comment passively
3746400	3751680	on this difference stating project moon dust and blue fly reported materials and intelligence
3751680	3756640	directly to the air forces foreign technology division out of right pad and we can do some
3756640	3762720	really interesting research by reading a primer on research and development in the us army we can
3762720	3769840	see in 1958 under trudeau the army established the army research office under the ocrd due to pressure
3769840	3776880	from civilian scientists which served as a single contact in the army to maximize army rnd efficiency
3776880	3783920	remember corso stated army rnd truly began to flourish in 1958 when army began doing rnd away
3783920	3789440	from civilian and institutions with prime eyes one can then reason the foreign technology
3789440	3795280	division may have run parallel to the aro army research office out of civilian and congressional
3795280	3800720	oversight this reasoning can be further supported when the document states the army chief of rnd
3800720	3806480	would have a parallel line of authority to handle technical services on matters in his area this
3806480	3811760	would in turn give the chief of rnd trudeau authority on assignment of key personnel
3811760	3819120	and allocation of rnd funds to technical services this rnd primer document also reveals some startling
3819120	3825200	revelations the army's initial needs for managing rnd efforts led to the creation of university
3825200	3832880	research initiatives u r i's independent laboratory in-house research i l i r and independent
3832880	3839120	research and development programs irads some of you may remember irads as a funding mechanism for
3839120	3846400	legacy programs mentioned by david grush furthermore these u r i and i l i r programs would eventually
3846400	3852800	lead to u a r c and f f r d c two types of military and federally controlled semi-private
3852800	3859360	groups that likely operate heavily with ufo legacy programs what a fascinating document there is
3859360	3865600	absolutely more to explore here such as the thesis of how legacy program architecture was born out of
3865600	3877360	army rnd i do want to spend some time visiting some of the smaller aspects to corso's disclosures
3877360	3882640	we glossed over discussing the manuscript corso additionally made some extremely interesting
3882640	3889200	claims regarding some information he gathered long after his service corso allegedly learned that in
3889200	3895920	february of 1987 colonel herald e phillips of the defense intelligence agency chaired a pentagon
3895920	3902000	group called the ufo working group this group apparently still in existence at the time of the
3902000	3909840	manuscripts writing in 1993 originally consisted of 17 men one army and three air force generals
3909840	3916320	di a scientists an army colonel three nsa officials a supervisor from the cia's domestic
3916320	3921520	collection division as well as a technical team from the cia's science and technology director
3921520	3927600	it well for one where is the navy here as the navy is likely up to its eyeballs in ufo legacy
3927600	3933120	programs such as the off-world technologies division housed at the naval surface warfare
3933120	3940320	center in crane indiana it seems strange that between 1987 and 1993 corso and his ufo working
3940320	3945120	group intelligence source would not know or not make mention to the navy's dealings in
3945120	3950720	uap legacy programs but let's go back to the mention of the cia's science and technology
3950720	3958000	directorate and how it is of extreme importance here by numerous accounts the cia ds and t is
3958000	3964560	where the quote unquote ufo portfolio is held according to eric davis as well as chris sharp
3964560	3970160	and many others the director of this position glenn gaffney was the individual who stopped
3970240	3978720	lockheed martin from divesting uap material to osap in 2008 additionally former cia ds and t deputy
3978720	3985680	director dug wolf helped create the cia office of global access in 2003 which was accused by
3985680	3991600	excellent journalist chris sharp as serving as a logistics coordinator agency alongside jsoc
3991600	3998320	joint special operations command for uap crash retrieval corso was way ahead of his time to
3998320	4003920	make mention to this this ufo working group according to corso also received funding from
4003920	4010560	us army inscom intelligence and security command founder major general albert stubblebein in the
4010560	4015680	last few projects i have done i have talked at length about stubblebein and his likely work in
4015680	4022720	uap legacy programs including fort hachuka in the 1960s stubblebein was also allegedly the man who
4022720	4030160	tried to pay off steven greer in the 1990s and the alleged founder of the nsa's men in black treat
4030160	4034960	tactical reconnaissance engineering assessment team we'll skip over this for now as we cover
4034960	4041600	this in-depth with edgar fuchet and the flying triangle arvs but for now how about this inscom
4041600	4047920	special forces unit the illustrious intelligence support activity isa was handed over to jsoc in
4048000	4055040	2003 the same year wolf constructed the cia office of global access which allegedly used jsoc for
4055040	4062560	uap retrievals isa is often known as the most secretive and clandestine of jsoc units even
4062560	4070160	outside of the ufo working group just how intimate is us army inscom with legacy programs and does
4070160	4076240	this working group not sound very similar to a majestic 12 leg structure let's take this time
4076240	4081600	to briefly point out another distinction between the book and the manuscript in day after roswell
4081600	4087760	claims are made of working adjacent to roscoe hill encoder and the infamous majestic 12 personnel
4087760	4093520	list under eisenhower and truman dawn of a new age sees corso recognizing the eisenhower briefing
4093520	4098320	document report but how he never saw the report at the nsc and white house
4098640	4108480	the vast majority of criticism against corso comes from analysis of the day after roswell
4108480	4114400	and his claims of technology ceding the lieutenant colonel's military accolades are beyond question
4114400	4119520	we have already addressed the stark differences between the manuscript and the book the book
4119520	4126000	clearly added myriad details to spice up the story of corso the manuscript is well it's tough
4126000	4131600	reading but it gives us an unbridled look into corso's experiences the manuscript was also
4131600	4136160	completed prior to the release of the day after roswell colonel alexander and others were shown
4136160	4141360	the completed manuscript around the time of the book's release while alexander jock valet and
4141360	4146240	others are still very critical of corso's they all maintain the lieutenant colonel's story
4146240	4153360	never wavered details were never altered added or subtracted corso sounded like a tape recorder
4153360	4158160	you could rewind or fast forward to parts of his disclosures and always hear the same details
4158160	4164640	never any wavering allegedly corso had but 24 hours to edit the day after roswell book which
4164640	4171280	led to no oversight on all the creative liberties in the piece one must ask why the subject of this
4171280	4177680	non-fiction book was stripped of all creative control of the project in his book john b alexander
4177680	4182640	details a letter he wrote to corso about all the issues related to the day after roswell
4182640	4187040	mind you these criticisms are all leveraged towards the book still interesting to keep in
4187040	4192320	mind and i highly recommend looking at this nonetheless link in the description many discrepancies
4192320	4197280	regarding technology seeding has been thrown at corso some of which we have already addressed
4197280	4202080	jock valet for example well versed in computer science stated corso's assertions regarding
4202080	4208160	integrated circuitry were not documented facts colonel alexander himself had specific issues
4208160	4213680	with the passive night vision system mentioned by corso alexander stated the genealogy of
4213680	4219200	infrared and nvg technology can all be accounted for alexander detailed how he spoke to the
4219200	4224560	director of night vision laboratory at fort belvoir virginia dr lou cameron who flatly
4224560	4230880	denied how an eye lens of nhi aided in passive night vision breakthroughs legendary researcher
4230880	4237040	stanton freedman was also extremely critical of corso associating him with bob lasar which in
4237040	4242800	my opinion regardless of skepticism against corso is very inappropriate freedman criticized
4242800	4248480	corso for his grand story absent of evidence this is a viewpoint i can absolutely empathize with
4248480	4255840	but what does stanton have to say now entirely differently in terms of background lieutenant
4255840	4262320	colonel philip j corso came out with the book on the 50th anniversary of roswell first published
4262320	4271680	right in roswell called the day after roswell in which he claims that when he was at the foreign
4271680	4276720	technology desk of the army research and development command at the pentagon under general trudeau
4277840	4283040	he surreptitiously slipped the filing cabinet full of advanced technology wreckage from roswell
4283760	4290160	into the hands of american industry and he saved the world that's how we got kevlar and
4290160	4297840	micro integrated circuits and a whole long list of things and uh it was a great story
4298480	4306160	and the forward of the book was by senator strong thurman the oldest serving member of the senate
4307520	4312960	who said nice things about corso but in his intro his forward says nothing about roswell
4313520	4319200	in his manuscript and book corso was indeed what you could describe egotistical but in his
4319200	4325520	memoirs he never once claimed to have been some sort of world savior he was very patriotic and
4325520	4330560	simply aimed to strengthen the army this is obviously not freedman's fault as the book
4330560	4337120	was his only available analysis on corso at the time well they make a very long story short when
4337120	4343440	you start checking on colonel corso lieutenant colonel corso things just don't check out he provides no
4344000	4348800	validation for any other claims there's no index in the book either they say new
4349680	4355680	documents finally released there's nothing new in there uh and many people have gone through i
4355680	4363040	know one phd who was a colonel in the military who sent me a list of 92 false claims made in the book
4363840	4369760	92 i mean just technically wrong all over the place well you can blame that on the co-author
4369760	4377600	maybe but uh some of the discoveries of physicists just won a nobel prize for example for work done
4378240	4383440	three years before corso was connected with the army research and development group
4384080	4390240	he's a nice gentleman i met him while he was alive uh but his claims
4392240	4399520	senator thurman withdrew his forward wasn't in the next edition of the book because it was written
4399520	4405280	for an entirely different book about corso's activities corso talked about the fbi his good
4405280	4411360	buddy hoover when his fbi file was released uh hoover had nothing but bad things to say about
4411360	4417680	corso now it muddied the waters and got a lot of attention why would such a distinguished
4417680	4422720	military man well the real military people will tell you he only made lieutenant colonel after
4422720	4430080	22 years in a lot of lieutenant colonels not nearly as many full colonels so it's another
4430080	4436640	example of taking advantage opportunism if you will uh he also claimed that he was a member of
4436640	4441040	the national security council and a sworn statement for a lawyer was going to go after the government
4441040	4446880	and spill out all colonel corso's files well i checked with the eisenhower library not only
4446880	4451760	was never a member of the national security council which is very prestigious indeed he never
4451840	4455680	attended a meeting of the national security council he was a liaison between the security
4455680	4464960	council and some other groups uh it doesn't help ufology to have this kind of thing going on
4466240	4475280	people accept a great deal and his book sold well but i'm sorry it isn't what it claims to be
4475840	4483680	it's not a real expose of the truth about roswell and flying saucers and government's new technology
4485360	4491680	cut now in july of 2024 john greenwald and the black vault published documents released by
4491680	4498160	the fbi on corso and no no documents discussing ufo's a portion of these documents pertain to
4498160	4504560	in 1964 to 65 fbi background check on corso for his perspective position on the immigration
4504560	4510000	and national security subcommittee of the house of representatives corso had allegedly provided
4510000	4514800	some unfounded claims in the past according to these documents delivering a list of fabian
4514800	4521040	socialists to his good friend arthur trudeau the fbi was unable to validate these claims
4521040	4526880	corso was also investigated for spreading claims garnered from cia sources that lee harvey oswald
4526880	4534000	assassin of jfk was an fbi informant now oswald being either an fbi or cia informant probably
4534000	4540080	does not seem too unlikely to everybody regarding a soviet defector michael gullinowski the fbi
4540080	4546320	document state quote another government agency has characterized corso as a parasite who has never
4546320	4552000	produced any intelligence through his own efforts but has profited from information developed by
4552000	4557840	dedicated government agents and investigators end quote all of these critical files on corso
4557840	4564080	were cross references and not main files meaning the fbi never officially investigated corso
4564080	4570240	from these files it does appear corso liked to quote unquote waste the fbi's time making
4570240	4576160	accusations no content here actually discusses his duties with the foreign technology division
4576160	4582000	let alone the army and of course it is odd the selection of documents released when they were
4582000	4586720	released why are there no documents on corso's army position and why are there no documents on
4586720	4593280	the foreign technology division my greatest issue with corso arises from a massive firsthand
4593280	4598880	experience relegated to the very end of his manuscript remember corso claimed to have
4598880	4605600	witnessed an extraterrestrial body in 1947 observed ufo's on radar at ballistic missile sites in
4605600	4611840	1958 and 1959 and eventually studied materials recovered from uap crashes for the foreign
4611840	4617200	technology division corso's affidavit says as much without reference to the nike missile site
4617200	4622880	encounters however at the end of this manuscript corso recounts an incident while in command of
4622880	4629440	a missile silo at white sands missile range corso claimed while driving alone in an isolated area
4629440	4635120	he sought shelter from the heat in an abandoned mine within the mine he claimed to have encountered
4635120	4641680	face to face a bean of non-human intelligence the bean was drawn in corso's manuscript and
4641680	4647440	communicated to him telepathically we can also see him relay drawings of this bean in a long
4647440	4653520	lost interview featured on weaponized with george nap the bean wished to leave the surrounding area
4653520	4658320	however active radar interference from nearby installations were preventing its craft's
4658320	4664080	departure a common theory by corso and some roswell researchers is radar systems interfered
4664080	4670240	with craft navigation leading to crashes i am still very skeptical on this point corso
4670240	4676240	asked the bean what he would get in return for lowering the radar coverage the bean responded
4676240	4682720	quote a new world if you can take it end quote corso would then grant the beans wish when he
4682720	4688480	returned to his installation this experience was so profound to him he would often contemplate the
4688480	4694960	meaning of the statement during life corso would even relay this story to john b alexander
4694960	4702640	george nap and possibly others including a film to his grandchildren somehow danie she hand saw
4702640	4709360	i i found to be extraordinarily important the the little eight millimeter home movie that uh
4709360	4716960	that uh kernel corso actually uh produced to be shown to his grandchildren after he died uh this
4716960	4723440	this is this i i found to be extraordinarily persuasive that he and i got to see the film uh
4723440	4729200	but it wasn't supposed to be shown till after he died and uh and i was shown the film uh and it
4729200	4733920	shows him talking to his grandchildren saying that even though i'm gone now i wanted to make sure
4733920	4742080	you understood this and what he did is he talked about the fact that back in 1945 in july uh when
4742080	4747360	before we had even dropped the bombs on her ocean in nagasaki while they were experimenting
4747360	4755040	with the nuclear bomb uh out in the desert at ala migordo and white flats uh that in uh new
4755040	4762320	mexico he he in fact was one of the the security officers there uh and he said that they were seeing
4762320	4769120	ufo's he told his grandchildren uh from the from the grave basically on the bit on the little
4769120	4775120	eight millimeter home movie that he had been there and that saw the ufo's and that he took
4775120	4780560	a lunch break to go leave and went off into the hill somewhere to go to lunch and he saw one of
4780560	4787280	the craft that had landed uh it had been somehow disabled by the radar that was up all around
4787280	4793600	the proving grounds uh and that he had a direct contact with the ufo occupants of the vehicle
4793760	4801120	and they they communicated to him telepathically to please take down the radar just temporarily
4801120	4807760	to allow them to flee uh and he actually did that he told his grandchildren he went back
4807760	4814720	and as a range officer ordered them to shut down the the radar for just a short time to do some kind
4814720	4822320	of recalibration of it and at that point the ufo craft fled uh shot off into the sky now that's
4822320	4828960	that's corso talking to his grandchildren in a in a private never intended to be made public
4828960	4836080	uh eight millimeter film and so i found that quite convincing about corso uh so when corso
4836080	4842080	reports that he was actually put into possession of some of the technology that had been recovered
4842080	4847760	from the raswell crash i tend to give it a considerable amount of credibility and the
4847760	4854960	fact that the the various uh aerospace uh corporations tried to set forth some sort
4854960	4860000	of a long explanation about how they really developed the silicon chip they really developed
4860000	4866320	the fiber optics they really developed uh the other uh technology that corso attributes to the
4866320	4871840	raswell crash that's exactly what they would do there's not any doubt about it that they would
4871840	4876640	obfuscate and they would try to construct some sort of an alternative explanation for how they
4876640	4883120	developed themselves this technology and so i'm just saying that uh i find the corso uh a
4883120	4889680	testimony more credible than many people do i must be very clear here how shehan is indeed
4889680	4895200	incorrect about the 1945 date corso claimed this event occurred when commander of the ballistic
4895200	4902720	missile firing range at red canyon part of white sands this station was in 1957 to 1958 my issue
4902720	4909440	here is this is a truly consequential encounter if true initially i believed this passage to be a
4909440	4915040	dream or metaphor until i read more about how many others corso would tell this story to
4915040	4921120	unfortunately this is an issue that plagues much of the ufo realm witnesses stating disclosures then
4921120	4926800	adding well and then this happened and then that happened far after their initial disclosures one
4926800	4932320	would imagine such an intimate encounter with a non-human intelligence biologic would be featured
4932320	4938000	in most of corso's disclosures make of this passage what you will however it does leave
4938000	4944160	somewhat of a sour taste in my mouth that such a dramatic encounter is relegated to the very back
4944160	4951760	part of his manuscript hey guys it's uap kerb thank you so much for joining me as we took this 90 plus
4951760	4958080	around 90 minute deep dive into the claims of lieutenant colonel philip j corso now before we
4958080	4963040	get started and kind of give this conclusion a lot of the time you'll see corso mentioned as
4963040	4968240	colonel philip j corso i have never once been able to verify that corso was indeed a full bird
4968240	4973920	colonel so thus i try to stay true to what i know as fact and what i've seen on his military records
4973920	4980160	and call him lieutenant colonel philip j corso so the reason i took on this project quite often
4980160	4986720	i'll see people either pro corso or anti corso and much of their arguments crux on the day after
4986720	4993200	roswell book a lot of the people who disregard corso or put away his claims have a unsavory taste
4993200	4998560	in their mouth from the day after roswell whether that be to some of the unsubstantiated and wild
4998560	5006080	claims such as um corso forcing a cia guy to self-delete or some of the egotistical megalomania of
5006080	5011680	corso in the day after roswell book about him being a world savior and just some of the uh perfect
5011680	5017120	synchronicities of you know perfect descriptions of the roswell crash and rosco hillencoder and
5017120	5023120	the majestic 12 so i wanted to take a step back and read the pure manuscript dawn of a new age
5023120	5029280	of corso this is a 176 page manuscript if you ever watch this video again if you're interested
5029280	5034960	i do recommend reading the full thing however it is a very dreadful read most things are talked about
5034960	5041280	eight or nine times throughout the manuscript so it can just be a trudge to get through now i
5041280	5048560	do notice that there are still some differences between corso's affidavit and the dawn of a new age
5048560	5055280	manuscript and this being the description of the encounter at white sands in 57 and 58 which we
5055280	5059200	just touched on in the end of the video of encountering a non-human intelligence with
5059200	5065600	almost a different physiognomy to the bean he claimed to have seen at fort riley in 1947 so
5066560	5072320	that that description still leaves a bit of a strange taste in my mouth due to reading it
5072320	5078800	after about 120 140 pages into the manuscript at first like i mentioned i did think it was
5078800	5084400	a metaphor a new world if you could take it something to teach his grandchildren to learn from
5084400	5091200	but corso is alleging that this is a true incident he not only wrote this in a film in his manuscript
5091200	5097440	in a film to his grandkids that somehow she hand saw but also told john b alexander joc velay and
5097440	5103440	george nap about this experience so let's kind of dive into some of the things i found very
5103440	5108400	interesting because i do think there's a lot of very credible statements made in the manuscript now
5108400	5113600	i cannot speak to the veracity of the technology ceding claims um i'm not an expert in integrated
5113600	5117760	circuitry i'm not an expert in computer science i'm not even an expert in metallurgy that was one of
5117760	5123680	my worst classes material science in the university so i cannot speak to that that is why i tried to
5123680	5129120	put a balanced take of course those claims and some traditional history but what we can speak on is
5129120	5134960	some of the factual accuracies of us army r&d at the time you know i know we analyzed that primer
5134960	5141600	quite a bit so it was fascinating to see kind of the army's need for a centralized r&d project
5141600	5147600	under trudeau spearheaded in 1958 just like corso said that's when the golden age of army r&d
5147680	5153360	began it was also very interesting to see back in the late fifties and early sixties the us army
5153360	5158400	was trying to kind of get with semi-private institutions and universities in order to um
5159200	5164080	flourish under army r&d this is something that we talked about quite often f of rdc's and ua rc's
5164080	5169040	and reverse engineering programs and legacy programs utilizing these sorts of institutions for
5170080	5176480	probably material study uh and so forth and also the foreign technology division this is
5176480	5181360	something i think is one of the most crucial aspects of this video that i've seen almost
5181360	5187440	nobody else talk about the foreign technology division under which corso worked was us army
5188080	5194400	not air force this is not the infamous foreign technology division out of right pat now we can
5194400	5200240	ask ourselves why is there no information about this foreign technology division why can we see
5200240	5207440	nothing about it except in the actual military documents under corso uh i myself have some foya
5207440	5212000	documents out to try to investigate for this further but as we've known with the interplanetary
5212000	5218000	phenomenon unit with the us army there are some weird institutions that somehow exist through
5218000	5223200	institutional memory i'll be interested in to see if i can pry anything free from foya regarding
5223200	5228880	the army's foreign technology division however my hopes aren't necessarily high that being that if
5228880	5234640	this was indeed one of the first structured us legacy programs i'm sure we'll get no information
5234640	5242720	and i do want to touch on that because if corso's claims are indeed true and i look favorably upon
5242720	5247520	the claims of corso we'll just say that there's some claims that still bewilder me like the
5247520	5255600	nhi encounter and so forth but this program started in 1960 would likely be one of the first
5255600	5262000	structured us legacy programs utilizing corporations you know bell labs and some of the fortune 500
5262000	5268800	companies as well as universities and semi-private institutions so if these disclosures and testimonies
5268800	5275120	are indeed fact we can extract a lot of interesting data and worthwhile investigation here seeing how
5275120	5280720	legacy programs were structured and framework and that is something that could extend to today which
5280720	5286800	i find highly likely seen as i do believe in modern day or at least the early 2000s the army's role
5286800	5294080	in legacy programs has often been r&d to try and equip the modern warfighter with um reverse
5294080	5298480	engineer technologies of unknown origin there will be a lot more to discuss on that in the future and
5298480	5303520	hopefully as we move on over time we can try and crack into some of these legacy programs and and
5303600	5311440	talking exactly what about the army air force navy does and what contractors work under them and so
5311440	5316880	forth speaking of contractors sperry rand wasn't that an interesting details the memoirs of trudeau
5316880	5323760	and discussed by corso one of the one of the companies they met with often was sperry rand and
5324320	5328480	when sperry rand went defunct i'm doing this off the top of my head which i believe was 86
5329200	5336640	much of their information and engineering divisions were bought up by rathion northrop honeywell
5336640	5342960	and i believe rathion as well as bell labs i think one of the most interesting connections here
5343520	5351520	is bell labs being owned by atn t who in turn owned san had ownership of sandia national labs
5351520	5357120	under mandate by truman sandia is a usual suspect mentioned in the majestic documents mentioned by
5357120	5362240	edgar fuchsia mentioned in the interplanetary phenomenon unit documents that are still disputed
5362240	5368800	to this day so there's a lot of interesting data here to kind of analyze a hypothetical or very
5368800	5375120	much real us army reverse engineering program and speaking of that i'm also so fascinated by
5375120	5380880	corso's discussion of the ufo working group wasn't that interesting mentioning the cia
5380880	5385600	directorate of science and technology having a major position on this group of about 17
5386480	5391200	18 people on the board as we know with the work of chris sharp thank you chris sharp if you ever
5391200	5397600	watch one of my videos i'm honored you're you're an inspiration but that in 2003 cia oga served as
5397600	5402960	a logistics coordinator for ufo crash retrieval with the help of jsoc as we have just analyzed
5402960	5408000	the cia directorate of science and technology doug wolf spawned the oga and then us army
5408000	5413760	inscom and founder major albert major general albert stubble bind who corso said funded
5413760	5420400	the ufo working group under inscom in 2003 the isa the intelligent support activity
5420960	5428640	known sometimes as the activity the most clandestine of jsoc units was given over to jsoc and this was
5428640	5434800	all in 2003 around the time of the oga's creation which is allegedly the time the oga served as
5434880	5440080	logistics coordinator for crash retrieval if you don't know much about the isa i highly recommend
5440080	5446960	watching some videos on them they are some uh true bad people in terms of just their training and so
5446960	5452080	forth are really interesting i'm always interested in learning more about jsoc but i do want to know
5452080	5457040	what everybody thought about the video and corso after analyzing his claims in a vacuum purely
5457040	5461920	analyzing his claims without any of the nonsense and extracurriculars from day after roswell what
5461920	5467120	does everybody think let's get a discussion going if you do not know i have a discord come join that
5467120	5470880	i'll have the link in the description uh we'll probably have some conversations going on about
5470880	5475360	corso and so forth because i would really like to talk about that if anybody has any experience
5475360	5480560	or other information on the foreign technology division let's get talking because i think that
5480560	5488160	if you take one single thing away from this video i i would like it to be that the army had an rnd
5488160	5494000	program in the 1960s called the foreign technology division that there are no documents and no
5494000	5499520	data for all we know is that trudeau followed upon his retirement in 62 by dwight e beach forced our
5499520	5504800	general um we're in command of us army are indeed the office of the chief of army research and
5504800	5510000	development so there are some kind of clues there for us to work on further but i hope everybody
5510000	5514240	enjoyed this project we're coming up on a year anniversary of the channel i got something a
5514240	5518880	little fun to to revisit for that but thank you all for tuning in again i'd like to know what
5518880	5525280	everybody thought i got a patreon in the in the channel description um i don't gatekeep any content
5525280	5530480	everything i do is for the world to see um so if you want to support the channel only support what
5530480	5535760	you think the channel is worth with that being said guys we will get working right on the next
5535760	5541040	project and i shall see everybody soon please remember to like and subscribe and thank you
5541040	5547040	so much for tuning in bye everybody
