00:00.000 --> 00:19.680
Your Army's Research and Development Program is a continuing effort to help ensure the survival

00:19.680 --> 00:25.640
of this nation. Army Industry Teamwork is essential to the accomplishment of the Army

00:25.640 --> 00:32.320
Research and Development mission. To maintain superiority in our military arsenal, new ideas

00:32.320 --> 00:40.200
are essential. New weapons must be developed and perfected to meet new requirements. In these days

00:40.200 --> 00:46.400
of explosive advances in science and technology, Army Research and Development plays a major role

00:46.400 --> 00:55.480
in maintaining America's military supremacy. You are saying to the human race for the first

00:55.840 --> 01:03.240
time, an official intelligence representative at a high level from the US government is saying

01:03.240 --> 01:10.160
publicly, we are not alone. We're definitely not alone. Absolutely the data points empirically

01:10.160 --> 01:18.960
that we're not alone, yeah. You've said that we have the United States has spacecraft, intact

01:19.400 --> 01:27.960
craft. Do we have bodies? Do we have species? Well, naturally when you recover something that's

01:27.960 --> 01:39.840
either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter dead pilots. Well, the book is really my experience

01:39.840 --> 01:46.320
of as I lived them and research and development of the Army under General Trudeau, Arthur Trudeau,

01:47.040 --> 01:50.320
when he drew me back in and put me in charge of that and established the Florida Technology

01:50.320 --> 01:58.880
Division for me. These were the artifacts from the crash flying saucer, which we used the word

01:58.880 --> 02:04.560
applied engineering. Dr. Tello is still alive, knows he helped him. We fed these things. He gave

02:04.560 --> 02:10.480
me the job of finding industry or scientists that were close to these items and feed us to

02:10.560 --> 02:14.480
them in normal R&D projects. And you're saying these items came from somewhere else. They came

02:14.480 --> 02:20.160
from a flying saucer. How do you know that? Because they were marked in the files that's coming

02:20.160 --> 02:25.360
from New Mexico. Roswell. Yeah, Roswell. Well, I think some came in might be another crash,

02:25.360 --> 02:31.600
but these were came from New Mexico and Roswell especially. And the General Trudeau gave me the

02:31.600 --> 02:38.640
job of working out a program, put these things out, feed them to industry, but there is provisions

02:38.640 --> 02:45.040
feeding it. They can have the patents, but they had to feed them out back to our house as a competitive

02:45.040 --> 02:52.400
edge of the Army and to the American people and the world as necessary. Before the 2023 congressional

02:52.400 --> 02:58.560
hearings on UAP, before the Schumer legislation and before Grush, the 20th century saw a decorated

02:58.560 --> 03:03.920
Lieutenant Colonel of the US Army speak and sign affidavits on the existence of non-human

03:03.920 --> 03:10.720
intelligence, crashed UAP, and exploitation of technologies of unknown origin. The legendary

03:10.720 --> 03:16.640
Philip J. Corso in his infamous book The Day After Roswell and lesser known but far more impactful

03:16.640 --> 03:22.960
manuscript Dawn of a New Age have cemented Corso as one of the most controversial yet credible UFO

03:22.960 --> 03:28.800
whistleblowers of all time. Lieutenant Colonel Corso central claims revolve around his time in

03:28.800 --> 03:34.320
the US Army serving as the chief of the foreign technology division where he claims he not only

03:34.320 --> 03:41.040
came in contact with autopsy reports of extraterrestrial beings but also craft and artifacts from UAP

03:41.040 --> 03:47.200
crashes and discussed how under his command technologies found in UAP were seated into US

03:47.200 --> 03:53.920
industry to give the army a competitive edge. But are Corso's grand and epic claims indeed true?

03:53.920 --> 03:59.440
And what can we learn from these claims? What valuable research can be extracted from the names,

03:59.440 --> 04:05.920
locations, agencies, incidents, and technologies mentioned by the late Corso? Hey guys it's UAP

04:05.920 --> 04:11.280
Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me as we fully analyze and deconstruct the testimony of

04:11.280 --> 04:18.320
Philip J. Corso in his claims of UAP crash retrieval, NHI biologics, and reverse engineering of

04:18.320 --> 04:24.160
exotic technologies. Let's conduct a comprehensive deep dive into Corso ranging from carefully

04:24.160 --> 04:29.120
analyzing statements made in his manuscript to digging through his military record and grand

04:29.120 --> 04:35.520
claims. And some quick bookkeeping before we get started today. We are taking the global best seller

04:35.520 --> 04:40.560
the day after Roswell co-written by Corso and throwing it out the window. We will instead

04:40.560 --> 04:46.480
be focusing solely on Dawn of a New Age. The original notes and manuscript of Corso released

04:46.480 --> 04:55.120
in Italy in 2003 and the US in 2011 after Corso's death in 1998 at the age of 83. We will do this

04:55.120 --> 04:59.920
so we can directly study Corso's pure claims without the creative liberties taken in the

04:59.920 --> 05:06.080
day after Roswell, possibly inserted by the other co-writer Bill Burns. According to Corso's son

05:06.080 --> 05:11.840
Philip Jr. he originally had no plans to release his father's manuscript but did due to his father's

05:11.840 --> 05:17.600
distaste for the best seller. As relayed by Jr. Corso went through the day after Roswell and

05:17.600 --> 05:23.440
highlighted everything he did not say or did not like. He got solely halfway through before giving

05:23.440 --> 05:28.560
up due to frustration with the book. Multiple individuals were privy to the manuscript before

05:28.560 --> 05:34.400
Corso's death such as Colonel John B. Alexander who remarked on sensational details featured in

05:34.400 --> 05:39.440
the book missing in the manuscript. Due to the existence of the manuscript and Corso's son's

05:39.440 --> 05:43.680
firm remarks of releasing the piece to correct the mistakes in the book that made his father

05:43.680 --> 05:47.840
furious during his lifetime, we must give Corso the benefit of the doubt and study

05:47.840 --> 05:54.000
solely his unfiltered words. For example, the day after Roswell is 130 pages longer than

05:54.000 --> 05:59.680
Dawn of a New Age whilst the two cover roughly the same concepts. Day after Roswell adds in details

05:59.680 --> 06:05.040
like recounting the time when Corso intimidated the CIA director of covert operations into

06:05.200 --> 06:10.880
self-deleting, the manuscript features no such tale. Another example is the book originally

06:10.880 --> 06:16.160
shipped with a forward written by U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond who angrily recounted his statements

06:16.160 --> 06:21.920
once learning the book centered on UAP leading to an early copy reprint. While the manuscript makes

06:21.920 --> 06:27.600
mention of Corso's relationship to Thurmond no such advocation by the senator was ever mentioned.

06:27.600 --> 06:32.720
A final example I'll discuss is the missing first chapter from the book, The Roswell Desert,

06:32.720 --> 06:38.880
which describes the Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash in painstaking detail and passes it off as an

06:38.880 --> 06:44.240
accurate description even though Corso was not present at this event. So feel free to visit

06:44.240 --> 06:49.600
the video description and download both the book and the manuscript and follow along as we dive into

06:49.600 --> 07:01.120
the claims of Corso. Philip Corso has as ironclad a background in the U.S. armed forces and military

07:01.120 --> 07:06.480
intelligence as does David Grush. Few other witnesses even with proven accolades in the U.S.

07:06.480 --> 07:11.920
military such as Roswell witness Walter Hott of the 509th bomb group come close to matching

07:11.920 --> 07:18.400
Corso's rank, stations and history. Lieutenant Colonel Corso served in the U.S. Army from February

07:18.400 --> 07:26.240
23, 1942 to March 1, 1963. The young man initially served in military intelligence during Europe in

07:26.240 --> 07:31.840
World War II before becoming chief of the U.S. Counterintelligence Corps CIC in Rome.

07:31.840 --> 07:36.320
At the end of the Second World War, Corso arranged safe passage for numerous Jewish

07:36.320 --> 07:41.920
refugees out of Rome and served as personal emissary to Giovanni Battista Montini who would

07:41.920 --> 07:48.880
become Pope Paul VI. Corso also served diligently in the early 1950s throughout the Korean War,

07:48.880 --> 07:54.320
performing intelligence directly under General Douglas MacArthur as chief of the special projects

07:54.320 --> 07:59.360
branch of the Intelligence Division Far East Command. His work here would focus mainly on

07:59.360 --> 08:05.280
prisoners of war, POWs, and missing in action MIA soldiers during the war, tasked with investigating

08:05.280 --> 08:12.000
North Korean POW camps and investigating the number of U.S. and U.N. POWs held at each camp.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
Phil would even testify in 1992 before the Senate Select Committee on POW-MIA Affairs on

08:18.000 --> 08:23.280
hundreds of American soldiers being abandoned at these camps. Corso served on the staff of

08:23.360 --> 08:29.600
President Eisenhower's National Security Council for four years from 1953 to 1957.

08:29.600 --> 08:34.640
Skeptics and detractors of Corso claimed he was never a member of this NSC under Eisenhower,

08:34.640 --> 08:39.360
however. The 1992 Senate Select Committee hearing report would say otherwise,

08:39.360 --> 08:46.160
where the retired Lieutenant Colonel was clearly listed as NSC staff under the Eisenhower administration.

08:46.160 --> 08:51.440
We can also analyze Corso's own FOIAd military documents which show him as a member of the

08:51.440 --> 08:57.520
Operations Coordinating Board, a U.S. secret covert operations committee established in 1952

08:57.520 --> 09:05.360
by Eisenhower under Executive Order 10483, which reported directly to the National Security Council.

09:05.360 --> 09:10.720
In 1960, Corso joined and shortly became commander of the Army's Pentagon-based

09:10.720 --> 09:15.360
Research and Development Program, the illustrious foreign technology division,

09:15.360 --> 09:20.880
under Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau. This foreign technology division is not

09:20.880 --> 09:25.840
the Air Force's infamous foreign technology division born out of the Air Force Technical

09:25.840 --> 09:30.640
Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This program stems from the

09:30.640 --> 09:37.200
Office of the Chief of Army R&D and has almost zero trace or record outside of Corso's own

09:37.200 --> 09:42.720
military documents, and we'll discuss this much further later on. I do briefly want to mention

09:42.720 --> 09:48.160
some interesting context to lend to the credibility of Corso as we dive into his claims.

09:48.160 --> 09:52.560
Viewers of my channel will know of my recent interview with Dr. Eric Davis of the Wilson

09:52.560 --> 09:58.720
Davis Memo, where Davis intimately discussed President and former CIA director George H.W.

09:58.720 --> 10:04.080
Bush's involvement with UAP legacy programs. Well, let's reference Jacques Valais' book,

10:04.080 --> 10:08.400
Forbidden Science Pacific Heights, which speaks on Eric Davis and former President

10:08.400 --> 10:13.600
Bush Senior's professional relationship. After a candid call initiated by Bush giving

10:13.600 --> 10:19.040
Davis advice on his future career, the two spoke again and saw Davis ask Bush about his

10:19.040 --> 10:24.880
interest in Corso's disclosures. Quote, could it be that Corso was mistaken in dealing with

10:24.880 --> 10:30.080
the material he was handling? Could that have been Nazi hardware? End quote. Shockingly,

10:30.080 --> 10:36.160
to the statement on Corso, Bush replied, quote, impossible. The two topics were clearly separated.

10:36.160 --> 10:41.680
By that time, all German secrets had been processed and filed away. They were not used

10:41.680 --> 10:48.000
as cover for anything else. End quote. Bush expanded on the 1954 alleged landing of non-human

10:48.000 --> 10:53.760
intelligence at Holloman Air Force Base, where allegedly Eisenhower and NHI brokered a deal.

10:53.760 --> 10:59.120
According to Bush, this event really did happen, resulting in a secret project with obscene

10:59.120 --> 11:04.960
security. When the two spoke again, Bush told Davis he was briefed on legacy programs by Trudeau

11:04.960 --> 11:10.640
at the time of the 1968 Mandel River's congressional hearings. The book says Colonel

11:10.640 --> 11:16.080
Trudeau, however, I do think this is a typo referencing General Arthur Trudeau. Bush senior

11:16.080 --> 11:21.440
claimed Trudeau told him his man Corso had been asked to testify before Congress and was able to

11:21.440 --> 11:28.400
reveal rumblings of alien hardware that had been distributed to industrial labs. The Corso testimony

11:28.400 --> 11:34.880
was squashed as a result of this conversation. And lastly, why did Corso wait until the 1990s

11:34.880 --> 11:40.400
to disclose his experiences with UAP technology? Well, this is because he made a promise to

11:40.400 --> 11:45.760
Trudeau. He would wait to speak until his death. What about the few people who are have criticized

11:45.760 --> 11:49.120
you to say, well, why are you coming out now? You're violating your security oath. What do you

11:49.120 --> 11:56.320
tell us? I've been asked that question many, many times. Number one is I had a nose with a general

11:56.880 --> 12:02.480
till we won't discuss this. A general said, when I die, feel your release from your oath.

12:03.280 --> 12:10.560
He died three years ago, and I started to write it. Number two is I couldn't talk about people

12:11.200 --> 12:16.320
over with us that I had no right to talk about. In intelligence, like a newspaper man,

12:17.680 --> 12:23.440
your source is not named unless he gives you permission to name him. I had no right to do that.

12:24.960 --> 12:31.200
And so my own family cruise on my son says, 35 years, you didn't talk. You didn't even tell us.

12:31.200 --> 12:36.080
So that's right. Why did I tell anybody? I had an oath was an honorable man, a great man.

12:37.120 --> 12:41.600
And I wasn't about to betray that oath. And not enough knowing that I had never

12:41.600 --> 12:46.560
any intention of writing a book or put that on paper. And there were in my mind a nice

12:46.560 --> 12:52.480
moment there. I never thought I'd write a book or even get a new movie on it. That never entered my head.

12:52.720 --> 12:59.040
Number two is I couldn't talk about people over with us that I had no right to talk about.

12:59.040 --> 13:05.280
Shortly before his death in July of 1998, CAUS, Citizens Against UFO Secrecy,

13:05.280 --> 13:10.480
published an affidavit released by Colonel Corso. This affidavit was signed for

13:10.480 --> 13:16.880
attorney Peter A. Gersten of CAUS in order to file a lawsuit against the Department of Army.

13:17.760 --> 13:24.800
This affidavit reads, quote, I, Colonel Philip J. Corso, retired, do hereby swear under the

13:24.800 --> 13:30.560
penalties of perjury that the following statements are true, that all times here and after mentioned,

13:30.560 --> 13:35.200
I was a member and officer of the defendant, that during my tenure with the defendant,

13:35.200 --> 13:40.160
I was a member of President Eisenhower's National Security Council and former head

13:40.160 --> 13:44.800
of the foreign technology desk at defendant's research and development department,

13:44.800 --> 13:50.160
that on or about July 6th, 1947, while stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas,

13:50.160 --> 13:56.160
I personally observed a four-foot non-human creature with bizarre-looking four-fingered hands,

13:56.160 --> 14:00.880
thin legs and feet, and an oversized incandescent lightbulb-shaped head.

14:00.880 --> 14:06.640
The eye sockets were oversized and almond-shaped and pointed down to its tiny nose. The creature's

14:06.640 --> 14:11.440
skull was overgrown to the point where all its facial features were arranged frontally,

14:11.440 --> 14:15.600
occupying only a small circle on the lower part of the head.

14:15.600 --> 14:20.560
There were no eyebrows or any indications of facial hair. The creature had only a tiny flat

14:20.560 --> 14:26.480
slit for a mouth and it was completely closed, resembling more of a crease or indentation between

14:26.480 --> 14:33.520
the nose and bottom of the chinless skull than a fully functioning orifice. That in 1961, I came

14:33.520 --> 14:39.920
into possession of what I refer to as the Roswell file. This file contained field reports, medical

14:40.000 --> 14:45.360
autopsy reports, and technical debris from the crash of an extraterrestrial vehicle

14:45.360 --> 14:51.360
in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. That I have personally read the medical autopsy reports,

14:51.360 --> 14:56.960
which refer to the autopsy of the previously described creature that I saw in 1947 at Fort

14:56.960 --> 15:03.280
Riley, Kansas. That the autopsy reports indicated the autopsy was performed at Walter Reed Hospital,

15:03.280 --> 15:08.560
which was under the authority of the defendant at the time of the autopsy. That the autopsy report

15:08.560 --> 15:14.160
referred to the creature as an extraterrestrial biological entity. Right off the bat here,

15:14.160 --> 15:19.920
it sounds extreme Corso claimed to have observed a mangled body he would later learn was a deceased

15:19.920 --> 15:26.720
bean from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash. If you are not well versed with the July 1947

15:26.720 --> 15:32.560
Roswell UAP crash retrieval, I do recommend doing some homework before continuing with this project.

15:32.560 --> 15:38.320
I'd recommend the Roswell cover up 75 years later, as well as my project UFO whistleblowers

15:38.320 --> 15:43.200
volume one to hear from some credible whistleblowers on the incident. For this video, we will be

15:43.200 --> 15:48.480
utilizing an array of interesting depictions of the crashed Roswell saucer. Based on reports

15:48.480 --> 15:54.240
and eyewitness testimony, Corso solely labeled the craft as the Roswell crashed saucer in dawn

15:54.240 --> 16:00.320
of a new age. We will explore all of these craft design in a future project solely focused on Roswell.

16:00.800 --> 16:07.520
One night, I was a post duty officer. Post duty officer means that I was in control. For that

16:07.520 --> 16:13.120
night, I was the one who checked all the guards, checked all security areas, fact checked the

16:13.120 --> 16:20.000
whole post. I was a duty officer that night. And I went to the veterinarian section and one of

16:21.360 --> 16:26.400
a sergeant I knew very well was Sergeant of the Guard that night. I told him,

16:26.400 --> 16:30.240
Sarge, how's everything around here? And he said, fine, sir. I told him, you know,

16:30.880 --> 16:34.960
they told me to be careful to watch this area because you have a sense of something sensitive

16:34.960 --> 16:40.880
here. He said, you want to see it, sir? I told him, yeah, let's go look. And I knew this sergeant,

16:40.880 --> 16:46.880
where he was a master sergeant. I went back and there was five crates there, like five or six,

16:46.880 --> 16:51.200
I think it was five. I listed one up and here's this body there and floating in food.

16:51.280 --> 17:00.880
And I looked at it about 10, 15 seconds, not much more than that. So I put it back down and said,

17:00.880 --> 17:05.920
Sarge, come on, get out of here now. I want to get you in trouble. Because I'm the duty officer,

17:05.920 --> 17:11.360
I can go around, walk around here. But you might get in trouble for coming back. Just come on,

17:11.360 --> 17:18.000
let's go, come out with me. So we went out and I told him, where did it come from, Sarge? He said,

17:18.080 --> 17:25.600
well, five trucks came through here from an airfield in New Mexico, and they're heading for

17:25.600 --> 17:31.760
Wright, Paterson Air Force. Now, in those days, I wanted all these big roads now. In those days,

17:31.760 --> 17:37.120
Route 40 was about the only cross-country route. And the route that they took was Route 40,

17:37.840 --> 17:41.280
going through Fort Raleigh, Kansas, and then up to Wright, Paterson Air Force.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.280
And I said, well, stay away from the sergeant. I don't want you to get in any trouble.

17:46.080 --> 17:51.680
I told him, I can walk around and see them. So, and I started to figure, what was that?

17:52.720 --> 17:58.960
First, I thought it was a child, because it was small. Then I looked at this head and all,

17:59.760 --> 18:05.520
right away, and this was only half of the matter, secondly. Then I put the end back down, and

18:07.360 --> 18:10.960
the head was different. The arms were spindly, the body, it was gray.

18:11.280 --> 18:16.880
So, right at that moment, I figured, I don't know what this thing is.

18:17.440 --> 18:21.760
Corso's official records do indeed place him at Fort Raleigh at this date,

18:21.760 --> 18:25.360
and he would claim he was told the convoy of trucks hauling the bodies were headed

18:25.360 --> 18:30.560
for Wright, Pat, and came from Route 40. This is very interesting, as quite often Roswell

18:30.560 --> 18:35.280
reports state wreckage was flown to Wright, Paterson Air Force Base, were deceased by

18:35.360 --> 18:41.440
logics transported separately, and if so, why? Myriad UFO crash retrieval stories feature

18:41.440 --> 18:46.720
flatbed Air Force and Army trucks hauling wreckage away, such as the 1953 Kingman and

18:46.720 --> 18:52.240
1965 Kecksburg crash retrievals. Also an interesting line, I'm sure many picked up.

18:52.240 --> 18:57.520
The body was referred to as an EBE, extraterrestrial biological entity,

18:57.520 --> 19:03.440
the same phrase used in the Majestic 12 Special Operations Manual. This manual describes two

19:03.440 --> 19:11.120
sets of EBE, EBE 1 and 2. EBE 1 closely matches the description of Corso's observed body.

19:11.120 --> 19:15.760
This affidavit provides little more information than Corso gaining first-hand knowledge of the

19:15.760 --> 19:20.320
Roswell crash, but fortunately we have his entire manuscript to study.

19:25.440 --> 19:30.160
Just to revisit, the bulk of Corso's testimony revolves around the U.S. Army's foreign

19:30.160 --> 19:37.360
technology division serving to exploit technology of unknown origin, TuO, from crashed UAP and seeded

19:37.360 --> 19:43.600
into U.S. industry to primarily bolster the U.S. Army war machine and, as a second directive,

19:43.600 --> 19:49.200
benefit the U.S. economy. Through this program, we start feeding it out to industry, but this was

19:49.200 --> 19:56.000
not on paper. They went out as normal research and development proposals, not to name something.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.360
Yeah, you didn't put out a report that said there's some alien stuff figured out.

19:59.360 --> 20:03.120
We put our regular research and development proposal that came from somebody's brain,

20:03.920 --> 20:08.720
and also this was known among a select few, mostly combat officers head-to-head.

20:09.840 --> 20:16.000
It came, we kept this among ourselves, because otherwise we were certain that they were

20:16.000 --> 20:19.920
destroyed our organization and we had a good organization, General Trudeau pulled it together

20:19.920 --> 20:24.240
just a couple years before. They were destroyed our organization and labeled us as kooks and

20:24.240 --> 20:30.960
taken our budget away. So, it had to be. We didn't cover because we gave it to industry

20:30.960 --> 20:36.400
what the provisions, and I'll repeat this, the provisions were to come back to us with what

20:36.400 --> 20:40.480
you prove, competitive edge of the army, give it to the people and to the world if necessary,

20:40.480 --> 20:48.080
and take the patents. This claim dating to 1962 parallels extremely closely the modern-day

20:48.080 --> 20:53.840
disclosures that branches of U.S. military work closely with contractors under unacknowledged

20:54.320 --> 20:59.600
special access program in order to exploit technologies of unknown origin to primarily

20:59.600 --> 21:05.600
benefit the U.S. military. Let's monitor this evolution closely as we explore CORSO. It is

21:05.600 --> 21:11.280
endlessly fascinating to compare the secrecy and centralization of technology exploitation programs

21:11.280 --> 21:16.720
under the foreign technology division as outlined by CORSO. All the way to how these UAP legacy

21:16.720 --> 21:21.680
programs may operate today, stove piped and protected from congressional oversight nestled

21:21.680 --> 21:27.280
within various intelligence agencies and military institution in league with defense contractors,

21:27.280 --> 21:33.760
UARCs, and FFRDCs. Anyways, to the memo. After a brief forward and acknowledgement with the

21:33.760 --> 21:39.040
awesome statement quote, if one passage in these memoirs helps you survive in a troubled world,

21:39.040 --> 21:44.800
then all this work is not in vain end quote. CORSO begins an introduction for the reader.

21:44.800 --> 21:49.360
Philip begins by giving the reader valuable insight into the creation of army research and

21:49.360 --> 21:54.240
development projects exploiting technologies of unknown origin. And guys moving forward,

21:54.240 --> 21:58.720
research and development will now be shortened to R&D and technologies of unknown origin will

21:58.720 --> 22:04.640
be shortened to TUOs. This sort of inception of a legacy UAP program gives us a framework to

22:04.640 --> 22:10.560
understand the construction and evolution of such programs. CORSO also quotes the father of German

22:10.560 --> 22:16.720
rocketry, flying saucer researcher and mentor of Werner von Braun, Hermann Oberth, who once stated

22:16.720 --> 22:21.920
quote, we cannot take the credit for our record advancements and certain scientific fields alone.

22:21.920 --> 22:28.960
We have been helped by people of other worlds and quote, 1947 to 1958 saw the disorganized

22:28.960 --> 22:35.120
dark ages of army research and development. NASA was founded in 1958, killing the army and DOD

22:35.120 --> 22:40.640
project horizon, which served to build a moon base. Atomic energy was stripped from the army and

22:40.640 --> 22:45.680
handed over to the Atomic Energy Commission. ARPA, the advanced project research agency,

22:45.680 --> 22:52.960
was also founded clashing often with army R&D. It wasn't until 1958, all army R&D was pulled

22:52.960 --> 22:58.320
under one single department, the office of the chief of army R&D. This was Lieutenant General

22:58.320 --> 23:04.400
Arthur Trudeau, who handled all personnel, tech services, laboratory and installations as well

23:04.400 --> 23:10.320
as budget. Trudeau would then create the foreign technology division and designate young CORSO

23:10.320 --> 23:16.080
as its chief. CORSO would take quote, all reports on foreign technology, which included foreign

23:16.080 --> 23:22.160
beans and events, those not of this world and quote, we will discuss this station and division

23:22.160 --> 23:26.400
in much greater detail later in the project. But for now, we are focusing solely on the

23:26.400 --> 23:34.080
manuscript's introduction. This led according to CORSO to the golden age of army R&D from 58 to 63.

23:34.080 --> 23:38.400
However, in this time, the army still faced many challenges impeding their work,

23:38.400 --> 23:45.200
civilian control of space efforts, DoD opposers, adverse policy guidance and the animosity of

23:45.200 --> 23:52.080
CIA Department of State. This would all lead to the hyper secrecy of all R&D data pertaining to

23:52.080 --> 23:57.920
areas out of this world. All of these materials were compartmentalized and trusted amongst a select

23:57.920 --> 24:03.600
few quote, great efforts were made to bring large industry and select laboratories into the army

24:03.600 --> 24:09.680
R&D fold, end quote. CORSO also states quote, the partners we sought and gathered were US industry,

24:09.680 --> 24:15.040
a strong laboratory support and many leading universities, end quote. I do believe this small

24:15.040 --> 24:20.160
line is one of the most crucial aspects of CORSO's testimony, believe it or not. Quite often on this

24:20.160 --> 24:25.840
channel, we talk not only about contractors involved in UAP legacy programs, but also university

24:25.840 --> 24:31.840
affiliated research centers, as well as federally funded research and development centers, semi private

24:31.840 --> 24:38.080
institutions. One such organization created during this golden age of army R&D is an FFRDC,

24:38.080 --> 24:44.640
I believe is up to their eyeballs in UAP legacy programs, MITRE. Officially established in 1958,

24:44.640 --> 24:50.640
MITRE was created by MIT Lincoln Labs employees, creating SAGE, the semi automatic ground

24:50.640 --> 24:55.680
environment program to coordinate radars to produce imageries of airspace for the military.

24:55.680 --> 25:01.040
A thesis I'd like to keep in mind during this exploration was the MITRE FFRDC created in part

25:01.040 --> 25:07.280
to fulfill the need of army UFO R&D to see technology into US industry. Of course the foreign

25:07.280 --> 25:12.800
technology division was created a year later in 1960, however CORSO does state before his station

25:12.800 --> 25:18.640
at the new office, material exploitation efforts by the army had been ongoing since Roswell. At

25:18.640 --> 25:23.360
an undisclosed date, but presumably around the time or just before the creation of the foreign

25:23.360 --> 25:30.720
technology division in 1960, CORSO states the top 25 industries on the Fortune 500 list were contacted

25:30.720 --> 25:35.920
and meetings were arranged with their board of directors, top personnel with the chiefs of army

25:35.920 --> 25:41.600
R&D. Laboratories were strengthened and organized, gathering funds to attract the best and brightest

25:41.600 --> 25:46.960
including foreign scientists such as those brought from Operation Paperclip. With contractors such as

25:46.960 --> 25:51.440
Bell Labs, who is credited with the development of the transistor and laser, two technologies

25:51.440 --> 25:57.920
CORSO said were leveraged from UAP alongside universities and army laboratories. This conglomeration,

25:58.000 --> 26:04.160
a powerful team, was tasked with exploiting TUOs. The guiding principle of this army project had

26:04.160 --> 26:10.000
but two goals, national security of the United States and protection of the American way of life.

26:10.560 --> 26:15.520
In a rare Art Bell coast-to-coast interview with CORSO and Colonel John B. Alexander,

26:15.520 --> 26:20.720
CORSO would state the foreign technology division began to operate with a budget of $2 billion.

26:28.320 --> 26:33.520
They weren't doing this gratis or for an investigation, you were commissioning them,

26:33.520 --> 26:39.040
you had budget money, research and development money that came along with these items you were

26:39.040 --> 26:43.920
giving them. We had a budget then it was tremendous, it was about $2 billion. $2 billion.

26:44.960 --> 26:50.480
We also gave out RDTAD contracts, research development tests and evaluation contracts.

26:51.040 --> 26:57.840
The first item that would be built from a research contract, we funded the building to the first

26:57.840 --> 27:06.240
one and after that other people and other agencies funded it. So we would fund these until it was

27:06.240 --> 27:12.640
actually developed. We had our laboratories, our atomic labs and the night viewing labs,

27:12.640 --> 27:18.640
where our labs at Fort Bell were. Colonel, what aspect of this were you overseeing? In other

27:18.640 --> 27:24.560
words, once you gave somebody a piece of this technology and a budget, what did you then do?

27:28.960 --> 27:36.160
This RDT&E funding would equal over $10.5 billion today, quite the starting budget.

27:36.160 --> 27:41.440
The mention of R&D test and evaluation contracts reminds me closely of witness Ed,

27:41.440 --> 27:46.320
who made claims of a joint UAP reverse engineering group operating between NELIS

27:46.320 --> 27:52.320
slash Area 51 and Edwards Air Force bases. After his service in the Edwards 412th group,

27:52.320 --> 27:58.480
Ed would work for USAF at the Pentagon serving on acquisition, integration and RDT&E panel.

27:58.480 --> 28:05.120
It was here Ed would claim $34 and $40 billion were siphoned off in respective years to non-air

28:05.120 --> 28:11.200
force TOA transfer of authority funds. Here in the introduction Corso breaks down some of the

28:11.200 --> 28:15.840
breakthroughs leveraged from the foreign technology division and golden age of R&D

28:15.840 --> 28:21.280
from studying reports and wreckage from Roswell and possibly other UAP recoveries.

28:21.280 --> 28:26.240
Let's go ahead and break these down. The first technology are image intensifiers,

28:26.240 --> 28:32.240
aka passive night vision devices. Corso stated the night vision laboratory at Fort Belvoir,

28:32.240 --> 28:38.000
Virginia created these first generation devices with aid from 48 US industries,

28:38.000 --> 28:43.360
all with varying knowledge of the project. Allegedly information gathered from the 1947

28:43.440 --> 28:48.880
Roswell crash led to this breakthrough. Passive systems were indeed constructed by the US Army

28:48.880 --> 28:55.040
in the early 1960s. However, many individuals such as Colonel John B. Alexander challenged

28:55.040 --> 29:01.120
this statement. One of the most contentious technologies discussed by Corso is fiber optics.

29:01.120 --> 29:06.240
This point of Corso's testimony has been highly contentious like much of the materials.

29:06.240 --> 29:11.680
Allegedly at Roswell, the recovery team discovered what they thought to be a broken wiring harness

29:11.760 --> 29:18.080
with each loose strand and emitting a different color. These wires were fiber optics.

29:18.080 --> 29:23.280
Bell Labs allegedly utilized this technology to spearhead the greatest advancements

29:23.280 --> 29:28.240
in communication history. Now this point is contentious because French scientists were

29:28.240 --> 29:34.400
indeed working on early developments of fiber optic principles in the early 1840s. Bell Labs

29:34.400 --> 29:39.280
was involved in the development of fiber optics in the 1970s where they improved the technology

29:39.280 --> 29:44.320
and minimized loss on mass scale production. Now let's keep in mind, Corso does say some

29:44.320 --> 29:49.600
of the non-human technologies leveraged were used to bolster human technology, so perhaps this

29:49.600 --> 29:54.720
drastic Bell Labs improvement is one of these instances. And speaking of Bell Labs, let's

29:54.720 --> 30:00.800
remember back to the testimony of Edgar Fouchet, who stated that FFRDC's Livermore Labs and

30:00.800 --> 30:06.960
Sandia National Labs reverse engineered the propulsion system for the TR-3B alien reproduction

30:06.960 --> 30:12.000
vehicle. According to the Majestic-12 documents in the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit report,

30:12.000 --> 30:18.560
Sandia has also served as a prime site for UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering operations.

30:18.560 --> 30:24.560
In fact, I have spoken so much about Sandia, I highly recommend committing them and FFRDCs

30:24.560 --> 30:30.720
in general to memory. The telephone company AT&T was given managerial responsibilities

30:30.720 --> 30:38.000
of Sandia National Labs by President Harry Truman in 1949. As of 1925, Bell Labs and their

30:38.000 --> 30:44.240
engineering R&D department was placed under shared ownership of Western Electric and AT&T.

30:44.240 --> 30:50.080
Very interesting connections here. Another alleged leverage technology were super tenacity fibers

30:50.080 --> 30:56.000
from one single strand of fiber that could not be damaged. The Army at that time, according to Corso,

30:56.000 --> 31:01.520
had a tremendous need for fibers, for flak jackets, parachutes, and other military items.

31:01.520 --> 31:05.840
Important to note, dawn of a new age states these fibers were utilized to construct

31:05.840 --> 31:11.040
composites for stealth technology and civilian aircraft, while day after Roswell states these

31:11.040 --> 31:18.240
fibers were used to construct Kevlar, the material in bulletproof vests and made by DuPont in 1965.

31:18.240 --> 31:22.960
Strange molecular alignment techniques were additionally studied from the Roswell crash.

31:22.960 --> 31:28.480
The craft showed molecules down to individual atoms, had been aligned in various patterns

31:28.480 --> 31:35.200
resulting in incredible hardness and resistance to scratches, stress, strain, and shear in metals

31:35.200 --> 31:40.800
while all repelling cosmic particles and radiation. The Chief of R&D of the Army thought this to be

31:40.800 --> 31:46.880
a truly consequential discovery and thus special teams were organized to investigate this chemistry.

31:46.880 --> 31:52.320
Corso stated this atomic rearrangement could lead to incredibly strong yet light spacecraft,

31:52.320 --> 31:58.480
but in 1963 and possibly through 1993 the Army had not solved this issue.

31:58.480 --> 32:03.680
I personally have heard some similar claims that non-human craft employ materials with

32:03.680 --> 32:10.000
interesting atomic arrangements. Corso also believed fluid application was leveraged from UFO

32:10.000 --> 32:15.760
propulsion and guidance systems. Fluidic principles led to the creation of the heart pump. Even though

32:15.760 --> 32:21.840
fluidic principles are quite old, they were not utilized commercially until about 1960 for the

32:21.920 --> 32:27.920
demand for reliable controls in space research. Two of the greatest technologies exploited by

32:27.920 --> 32:33.920
Army R&D according to Corso were the transistor and integrated circuit. As we mentioned above,

32:33.920 --> 32:41.120
Bell Labs first introduced a point contact transistor in 1947. Jack Kirby of Texas Instruments

32:41.120 --> 32:48.000
introduced the first hybrid integrated circuit between 1958 and 1959. Corso's testimony illustrates

32:48.000 --> 32:53.840
a strange transistor with hair-like wires and leads and a chip in a stack of thin uniformly

32:53.840 --> 32:59.680
shaped wafer-like components found in a crash retrieval. Quote, these formed complete electrical

32:59.680 --> 33:05.520
circuits and developed into the micromodule concept. CRD said it would take 50 years to develop the

33:05.520 --> 33:12.480
transistor and 200 years to develop the chip. It came in a short span of five years, end quote.

33:12.480 --> 33:18.960
Corso does state this development occurred before the Golden Age of Army R&D, 1958 to 1963,

33:18.960 --> 33:25.360
with advancements as early as 1947. As he states improvements were made to the existing technologies

33:25.360 --> 33:31.760
in 1959 with the introduction of miniaturization of circuits. In fact, when Corso began his service

33:31.760 --> 33:37.040
as special assistant to Trudeau in 1960, Trudeau would allegedly show in both transistors and

33:37.040 --> 33:41.920
integrated circuits and engage in some philosophical discussion on the implications of harnessing

33:41.920 --> 33:47.280
off-world technologies for human use. Perhaps this does indeed adhere to conventional history,

33:47.280 --> 33:53.120
which states physicist Julius Edgar Lillianfield proposed the concept of a field effect transistor,

33:53.120 --> 33:59.680
an FET, in 1926. But it was not possible to construct a working device at that time. It was

33:59.680 --> 34:06.320
not until 1947 we saw application of transistors. The Lieutenant Colonel also stated the laser,

34:06.320 --> 34:11.920
who many program members suggested was the EBE's method of communication over vast distances of

34:11.920 --> 34:17.760
space was derived from the Roswell crash. As we know, the laser, which stands for light amplification

34:17.760 --> 34:24.640
by stimulated emission of radiation, was created in 1960 under Bell Labs. And again, what was the

34:24.640 --> 34:31.920
purpose of all of this R&D in Corso's own words, quote, to guarantee a superior competitive position

34:32.880 --> 34:38.000
given the superior data by the accidental discovery at Roswell, we reduce scientific data

34:38.000 --> 34:43.600
to a definite development to fulfill a military requirement. We never quibbled over who discovered

34:43.600 --> 34:49.040
or invented the development. The feeling was if a discovery was adapted to a concrete development,

34:49.040 --> 34:53.360
we would all be ahead in the game and the nation would benefit, end quote.

34:53.360 --> 34:59.040
This reminds me almost identically of the claims made by David Grush regarding secrecy of legacy

34:59.040 --> 35:03.840
program operations. So the reason for the secrecy exactly is what?

35:06.080 --> 35:13.840
Feudalistic dominance, who can have both asymmetric technology for, it seems like,

35:13.840 --> 35:20.560
just fueling the war machine. Grush says that through the 50s and 60s, encounters with the

35:20.560 --> 35:27.040
NHI continued, as did the cover up. Key to mention here, it is stated in the manuscript

35:27.040 --> 35:32.960
extraterrestrials never gave humans a thing. Not one scientific advantage came voluntarily.

35:32.960 --> 35:39.360
Everything was garnered by accident or perhaps force in some cases. This raises a very interesting

35:39.360 --> 35:44.320
point. Numerous individuals such as David Grush have flirted with the subject of agreements with

35:44.320 --> 35:50.160
humans and non human intelligence. If these agreements do not involve technology, what do

35:50.160 --> 35:57.600
they involve? And it's quite clear that you're talking about agreements between America and

35:57.600 --> 36:03.840
non human intelligences. Have we made agreements with non human intelligences?

36:05.280 --> 36:09.920
That's the kind of information I really hope national leadership is able to get to the bottom

36:09.920 --> 36:14.880
of. I need to pin you down on this. Are there agreements between non human intelligences

36:14.880 --> 36:19.920
and the American government? I think that's a question that I would

36:21.360 --> 36:26.800
like to know all the details of as well. Or is it possible R&D programs were kept separate from

36:26.800 --> 36:31.840
other compartmentalized programs that inherited technology, a separation of programs I believe

36:31.840 --> 36:35.840
is active today? I think something that a lot of people don't ask that has kind of captured my

36:35.840 --> 36:39.840
attention. During your time investigating legacy programs, did you see much collaboration

36:39.840 --> 36:44.640
or compartmentalization between programs that may exist in Navy Air Force Army?

36:44.640 --> 36:50.800
It's too snowpiped or compartmentalized. You can't open it up to another one unless there is a need

36:50.800 --> 37:00.880
to do that. That need to get access is defined on a government form called the DD-254.

37:01.840 --> 37:10.640
And the DD-254 documents who has access and why and what gets access. And if you're going to

37:11.680 --> 37:17.200
have to get access to another compartmentalized program, then that has to be justified in the

37:17.200 --> 37:22.400
DD-254. And usually that's not justified because programs don't really overlap.

37:22.400 --> 37:27.760
However, Corso's claims NHI technology was taken, not inherited, mirrors closely the

37:27.760 --> 37:33.920
claims of Fluxliner alien reproduction vehicle witness Brad Sorensen, who was told at the 1988

37:33.920 --> 37:40.320
Norton airshow the basis for the ARV the Roswell wreckage was taken without the consent of its

37:40.320 --> 37:46.560
operators. Another interesting parallel to today is a contractor Corso makes numerous mentions to,

37:46.560 --> 37:53.120
the Sparey Rand Corporation. Not to be confused with the Rand FFRDC, Sparey Rand was a major

37:53.120 --> 37:58.720
20th century electronics corporation and military contractor. Sparey Rand was additionally named

37:58.720 --> 38:04.160
in General Trudeau's memoirs as a frequent spot for meetings. He would often meet with their CEO

38:04.160 --> 38:10.480
and directors to discuss Army R&D projects. One such director was the legendary General Douglas

38:10.480 --> 38:16.800
MacArthur. Sparey Rand went defunct in 1986 and many of its divisions became part of Honeywell,

38:16.800 --> 38:22.640
Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. Corso then goes on to mention a long list of

38:22.640 --> 38:28.320
other benefits garnered from UFO technology exploration. One I want to mention is anti-missile

38:28.320 --> 38:33.920
missiles for the Star Wars program. Long have I stated the Star Wars program, formerly known as

38:33.920 --> 38:39.760
the Strategic Defense Initiative, had a secondary function to fund UAP programs and act offensively

38:39.760 --> 38:44.960
against UAP. There is indeed interesting research to suggest although the program was set in place

38:44.960 --> 38:50.880
by Reagan in 1983, Eisenhower established the program for UAP offensive action during his

38:50.880 --> 38:56.480
presidency. The Colonel discussed the need for protection against the EBEs themselves. The

38:56.480 --> 39:01.920
Lieutenant Colonel stated EBEs have performed acts of war with superior advanced equipment and

39:01.920 --> 39:07.520
superior techniques. The threat internally was treated similar to the Soviets as a fig leaf

39:07.520 --> 39:13.520
policy where the Soviets and non-human threatened existence but were not considered enemies. These

39:13.520 --> 39:18.160
acts included the controversial abduction phenomena and mutilation as well as quote

39:18.160 --> 39:23.440
spying on our atomic installations. Hindering missile and space equipment testing, hampering

39:23.440 --> 39:27.920
our military deterrent and nuclear deterrent, halting and interfering with exploration of

39:27.920 --> 39:33.120
moon and Mars, causing crashes of aircraft and casualties among military personnel and

39:33.120 --> 39:38.000
tampering with human and animal genome, end quote. I would like to explore some of these

39:38.000 --> 39:43.520
more controversial claims in a future project so let's hold on to this. This passage is key to

39:43.520 --> 39:48.640
reflect on as in the revelations of David Grush we have heard people have been hurt and killed by

39:48.640 --> 39:54.960
UAP but cannot attribute malicious intent to these intelligences. To conclude with the introduction,

39:54.960 --> 40:00.960
Corso placed much admiration for the individuals behind exotic R&D. These veterans of World War

40:00.960 --> 40:05.840
II in Korea were entrusted with the United States government's highest level deepest secrets.

40:05.920 --> 40:16.000
Now that we have spent over half an hour investigating the introduction of the manuscript,

40:16.000 --> 40:21.360
we can start to dive in and explore more of Corso's claims in depth. Throughout the

40:21.360 --> 40:26.160
introduction of this document, we heard Corso recount for the reader much of his early military

40:26.160 --> 40:31.280
career but quickly let's recap some of his highlights right before he met General Trudeau in

40:31.280 --> 40:40.000
his own words. Well your career to the to the point that you meant the general was a very honorable

40:41.200 --> 40:46.880
and fairly normal military career. It was in comp at this time because we were fighting the

40:46.880 --> 40:54.560
war in North Africa in Italy and then I joined the general. I went to Korea last time. I participated

40:54.560 --> 41:02.000
in the Korean War and I joined the counter staff over there and I came back and when I came back to

41:02.000 --> 41:08.320
the pages I joined Kevin Heidenhaal as one of the military in the United States with the White House

41:09.200 --> 41:15.120
and there my career for the team I was in the White House for four years and from there I took

41:15.120 --> 41:23.360
command of of the military defiant, the army's military defying range, the White Vans and then

41:23.440 --> 41:32.880
I took the command of the Germans and I became I stayed in command 18 months and then I became

41:32.880 --> 41:38.880
Secretary General of the Army and from there I came back to the United States and General Trudeau

41:38.880 --> 41:45.280
had reorganized research and development of the army and he sent for me and I joined him as a

41:45.280 --> 41:50.720
special assistant and chief of the forces of the division. Corso claimed his military career saw

41:50.720 --> 41:56.640
him earn nine clearance levels above top secret up to the coveted eyes only material for the White

41:56.640 --> 42:02.720
House NSC matters. Achieving these clearances is when Lieutenant Colonel would claim he became

42:02.720 --> 42:08.960
aware of UFO information though nothing pertaining to legacy programs or reverse engineering since

42:08.960 --> 42:16.000
his NSC position occurred from 1953 to 1957. We can wager any interesting UFO information was

42:16.000 --> 42:21.360
presented to him as Intelligent Staff O for the Operations Coordinating Board attached to the

42:21.360 --> 42:26.880
National Security Council. Corso claimed his superior and the President Special Assistant C.D.

42:26.880 --> 42:33.280
Jackson along with President Eisenhower himself were the only individuals aware of Corso's clearances.

42:33.280 --> 42:38.400
C.D. Jackson here is Charles Douglas Jackson Special Assistant to Eisenhower and Government

42:38.400 --> 42:44.400
Psychological Warfare Advisor. Jackson served as liaison between the freshly minted CIA and the

42:44.400 --> 42:49.920
Pentagon. Jackson was also a member of the Committee on International Information Activities.

42:49.920 --> 42:55.600
Corso did discuss how in officer school he began specializing in air defense and ballistic missiles.

42:55.600 --> 42:59.760
Twice during his command of missile units unidentified objects were picked up over New

42:59.760 --> 43:05.680
Mexico and Germany traveling at over 3,000 miles per hour. Corso was ordered to destroy

43:05.680 --> 43:11.200
any records and tapes. Following service as commander of the 71st Missile Battalion in Germany

43:11.200 --> 43:16.240
and Inspector General of the 7th Army, Corso was led to become Special Assistant to the Chief of

43:16.240 --> 43:22.720
Army R&D Lieutenant General Arthur G. Trudeau quote. If Edwin Teller could be called the father

43:22.720 --> 43:28.000
of the H-Bomb, General Trudeau could be called the father of the ballistic missile end quote.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
And now we can get into some of the very juicy details. In 1960 Corso entered into his position

43:34.000 --> 43:39.840
as Chief of the Foreign Technology Division having seen a small strange body while also being read

43:39.840 --> 43:44.960
into some unknown UFO information due to his clearance levels and had been told of some exotic

43:44.960 --> 43:50.560
technologies leveraged from off-world technologies by his mentor and boss Arthur Trudeau. But I do

43:50.560 --> 43:56.160
find it strange Corso does not write about the 1947 non-human intelligence body encounter in

43:56.160 --> 44:01.760
dawn of a new age as we observed and assigned affidavit. This is especially strange because

44:01.760 --> 44:07.760
this encounter of biologics was relayed in the book day after Roswell so I guess let's go back

44:07.760 --> 44:12.960
and hear this story recounted in Corso's own words. And I was instructor at the intelligence

44:12.960 --> 44:21.600
school and we had an aggressor force that I was. Though one night I was post-duty officer. Post-duty

44:21.600 --> 44:27.520
officer means that I was in control. For that night I was the one who checked all the guards,

44:27.520 --> 44:32.400
checked all security areas, in fact checked the whole post. I was a duty officer that night.

44:32.560 --> 44:40.480
And I went to the veterinarian section and one of a sergeant I knew very well was Sergeant of

44:40.480 --> 44:46.160
the Guard that night. I told him, Sarge, how's everything around here? And he said, fine, sir.

44:46.160 --> 44:50.720
I told him, you know, they told me to be careful to watch this area because you have a sense of

44:50.720 --> 44:55.600
something sensitive here. He said, you want to see it, sir? I told him, yeah, let's go look.

44:56.560 --> 45:01.200
And I knew this sergeant very, he was a master sergeant. I went back and there was five crates

45:01.200 --> 45:07.040
there, like five or six, I think it was five. I listed one up and here's this body there and

45:07.040 --> 45:16.720
floating in fluid. And I looked at it about 10, 15 seconds, not much more than that. So I put it

45:16.720 --> 45:21.600
back down and said, Sarge, come on, get out of here now. I want to get you in trouble because

45:21.600 --> 45:27.040
I'm the duty officer. I can go around and walk around here. But you might get in trouble for

45:27.040 --> 45:33.200
coming back. Just come on, let's go, come out with me. So we went out and I told him,

45:33.200 --> 45:36.800
where did it come from, Sarge? He said, well, five trucks came through, I'm coming through here

45:37.840 --> 45:43.760
from an airfield in New Mexico and they're heading for Wright, Paterson Air Force. Now,

45:43.760 --> 45:50.320
in those days, I wanted all these big roads now. In those days, Route 40 was about the only cross

45:50.320 --> 45:56.240
country route. And the route that they took was Route 40, going through Fort Raleigh, Kansas,

45:56.240 --> 46:00.880
and then up to Wright, Paterson Air Force. And I said, well, stay away from Sarge. I don't want

46:00.880 --> 46:07.680
you to get in any trouble. I told him, I can walk around and see. So, and I started to figure,

46:07.680 --> 46:15.280
what was that? First, I thought it was a child because it was small. Then I looked at this head

46:15.280 --> 46:20.640
and all, right away, and this was only happened a matter of seconds. Then I put the end back down

46:21.600 --> 46:30.320
and the head was different. The arms were spindly, the body was gray. So, right at that moment,

46:30.320 --> 46:36.560
I figured, I don't know what this thing is. So, like an intelligence business, I just better put

46:36.560 --> 46:42.160
it on back of my head here and wait to maybe in the future, I get cooperation so I can evaluate

46:42.160 --> 46:46.800
what it is. As Chief of the Foreign Technology Division, the young Lieutenant Colonel would

46:46.800 --> 46:52.480
receive, quote, all reports on foreign technology, which included foreign beans and events, those

46:52.480 --> 46:57.680
not of this world, end quote. He would spearhead a team of Nazi scientists brought over from

46:57.680 --> 47:03.520
Operation Paperclip, as well as US scientists and technicians. Some of these pieces of technology

47:03.520 --> 47:09.600
were known to be from crashed UFOs, while others were educated guesses. Corso did recognize his

47:09.600 --> 47:15.200
position arose almost exclusively from his close relationship with the infamous Trudeau. In fact,

47:15.200 --> 47:20.320
Trudeau personally gave Corso what is now famously known as the Roswell file, a box of

47:20.320 --> 47:23.520
materials and files pertaining to the infamous crash.

47:45.520 --> 47:54.000
I opened it up and I started finding the material which he called later, Corso's Jump,

47:56.080 --> 48:00.720
and there was a bunch of wires, which I didn't know what they were, which were immediately colors.

48:00.720 --> 48:07.360
I didn't even know if they were wires. I had this chip, this integrated circuit, a laser instrument.

48:08.640 --> 48:12.400
They could do like some of the fine cuttings that they save in manual simulations.

48:12.960 --> 48:24.080
And I had also fiber optics and I had those and I recalled them. We started that because

48:25.040 --> 48:31.280
one of my, and I had reports on autopsy that performed a law to read on our lab, which we

48:31.280 --> 48:38.080
financed the law to read. And when I read that, it matched with what I saw for roughly 14 years

48:38.080 --> 48:46.320
before. The whole autopsy was similar, what I'd seen. So then I start putting two and two together

48:48.080 --> 48:51.200
and gradually these items will start, and then the general called me and said,

48:51.200 --> 48:56.800
work out a program. Find scientists who are working on these things and shove them in there.

48:57.600 --> 49:00.800
I told the general, I have to study these things old because really,

49:01.600 --> 49:04.960
I told him, I'm not that bright. I don't know what these things and all of these things are,

49:05.040 --> 49:10.160
but they're important. He said, well, Phil, they are important. Give me a program what they are.

49:10.720 --> 49:15.760
Anyways, after Corso was designated as the chief of the foreign technology division by Trudeau

49:15.760 --> 49:23.120
in 1960, Corso was given four subjects to keep track of. One, foreign development of this world.

49:23.120 --> 49:29.680
Two, foreign intelligence and developments not of this world. Three, act as interim project

49:29.680 --> 49:36.480
officer on select R&D projects and four, all other duties assigned as special assistant

49:36.480 --> 49:42.960
to the CRD for the US Army. National security measures meant points one, three and four fell

49:42.960 --> 49:48.800
into normal categories, but point two was a whole different matter. Many experts in the

49:48.800 --> 49:54.560
know felt the army was helpless in the face of NHI technology. Let's briefly touch on some more

49:54.560 --> 49:59.520
technologies and items featured in the Roswell report given to Corso by Trudeau. We have yet to

49:59.520 --> 50:05.200
discuss amongst the physical technologies and reports on artifacts such as a paper thin high

50:05.200 --> 50:10.320
strength metal found at the Roswell crash. Corso discovered autopsy reports discussing

50:10.320 --> 50:17.200
beings almost identical to what he observed in 1947. Accompanying images show decomposed

50:17.200 --> 50:23.040
bodies roughly four feet tall and medical reports detailed heavy variations to human anatomy and

50:23.040 --> 50:29.600
organs as well as skin and bone composition. These biologics heart and lungs were very large

50:29.600 --> 50:34.880
with a remarkably different muscular structure. The beings appear to have skin and bone structure

50:34.880 --> 50:41.120
built to protect vital organs from cosmic action, cosmic radiation or gravitational pull.

50:41.120 --> 50:45.680
And it is interesting, according to the manuscript, a transparent film over the eyeball

50:45.680 --> 50:51.680
of the deceased EBEs led to Trudeau mandating the pursuit of passive night vision technology.

50:51.760 --> 50:57.040
Analyzing every single file he had on the Roswell crash saucer, Corso did notice some

50:57.040 --> 51:03.440
odd discrepancies between the beans and their craft. The files had no mention of food or nourishment

51:03.440 --> 51:08.720
for the beans in the craft nor mention of water or drinking water or water for cleansing the body.

51:08.720 --> 51:13.440
The files made no mention to refrigeration equipment, no mention of medical equipment

51:13.440 --> 51:19.200
besides what the recovery crew guest was a first aid kit and there was no toilet or waste disposal

51:19.200 --> 51:26.160
facilities or no rest and no recreation facilities. Corso and the OCRD believed these beans to be

51:26.160 --> 51:32.560
clones or at the very least expendable creatures sent by some sort of intelligence. The chief

51:32.560 --> 51:37.520
even believed the Roswell craft to be a reconnaissance craft that would return to a mothership for

51:37.520 --> 51:43.520
necessities. The Lieutenant Colonel also reasoned possibly this species had solved gravitational

51:43.520 --> 51:49.360
time dimensional travel and could instantaneously return to their base. Throughout the manuscript

51:49.360 --> 51:56.480
Corso would often hint at multiple UAP or crashed flying saucers analyzed. It is frustrating we don't

51:56.480 --> 52:03.440
get a total count besides confirmation of the Roswell crash as well as the 1947 July San Augustine

52:03.440 --> 52:09.680
New Mexico crash in which allegedly a flying saucer crashed with no seams, joint lines,

52:09.760 --> 52:15.680
rivets or weld joints. This is a ubiquitous description in almost all UFO crash retrieval

52:15.680 --> 52:21.520
reports. So when I start putting all this on the extraterrestrial together and finally gave it a

52:21.520 --> 52:28.560
name I told them it looks like you know these are clones and so the name came out extra extraterrestrial

52:28.560 --> 52:34.320
biological entity that's what we figured they were better described than we never used the letters

52:34.320 --> 52:41.760
ET there was no such thing. He said that they look like clones how they're clones not look like

52:41.760 --> 52:50.400
clones they were clones we figured that they were created by some some other intellect and we also

52:50.400 --> 52:58.400
came to the decision that they were made to specifically the travel in space because we knew

52:58.480 --> 53:06.320
in those days that man could not travel in space some bones are affected his muscles are affected

53:06.320 --> 53:11.920
his brain is affected man cannot travel in space so we came to the conclusion that these creatures

53:11.920 --> 53:19.520
whatever they are are made to travel in space and gradually through what work we did we found

53:19.520 --> 53:24.320
out that disintegrated with the flying saucer and with you because most of the failures making

53:24.320 --> 53:30.480
by saucers were the guidance system that this creature was also the guidance system was part

53:30.480 --> 53:35.920
of the engine of the flying saucer it is also fascinating to see how the team was inspired

53:35.920 --> 53:41.680
and attempted to study harnessing brainwaves to control aircraft and anti-missile missiles

53:41.680 --> 53:47.040
this inspiration came from apparent discoveries that these extraterrestrial biological entities

53:47.040 --> 53:52.640
were part of the craft's guidance systems this may seem like science fiction however we do live

53:52.640 --> 53:59.120
in an age where consciousness connection is indeed discussed with UFO craft piloting and

53:59.120 --> 54:03.520
we came to a conclusion even in those days that these were the reason most flying saucers have

54:03.520 --> 54:09.680
failed is because our conclusion was that this being is part of the guidance system he's part

54:09.680 --> 54:15.120
of that saucer i've just had one of the most senior scientists in the u.s defense department

54:16.080 --> 54:25.760
former admit to me that he was read into a ufo crash retrieval program i've spoken to well over

54:25.760 --> 54:35.600
20 people now what i was told consistently was the technology is mind-blowing and they are not

54:36.080 --> 54:44.640
in a position to be able to engineer it yet because it's just light years beyond what we

54:44.640 --> 54:51.920
have it's a completely new type of physics is what one person said to me and you might be interested

54:51.920 --> 55:02.160
in this jay because of the sort of direction that your interests have taken without expanding on it

55:02.480 --> 55:09.280
expanding on it one of the people i spoke to told me that it had a lot to do with a mind

55:09.280 --> 55:14.000
interface connection with the engineering that it was driven by some kind of consciousness or

55:14.000 --> 55:22.480
some kind of intelligent connection with machinery that was beyond our understanding

55:22.480 --> 55:28.080
shockingly we can add even more context to these claims by analyzing the files of the legendary

55:28.080 --> 55:34.080
lennard stringfield and take a look at a report of a possible recovered vehicle or alien reproduction

55:34.080 --> 55:40.560
vehicle that utilized headband transceivers to operate quote len spoke to a mr. hines who had

55:40.560 --> 55:45.600
a source from bell labs the informants stated that he was on the flight line at a california

55:45.600 --> 55:52.160
air force base in the early 1950s and saw a ufo retrieval brought in he allegedly saw a cutaway

55:52.160 --> 55:57.840
of the recovered craft plus the headband transceivers worn by the aliens anyone involved with the

55:57.840 --> 56:02.800
retrieval was subject to intense scrutiny and search apparently one man must have kept a

56:02.800 --> 56:08.800
part of the craft and he mysteriously disappeared he was never seen again the source feels that the

56:08.800 --> 56:14.560
man was eliminated end quote chief corso somehow stumbled upon information that the soviets were

56:14.560 --> 56:20.800
running their own parallel to you o exploitation program this may have stemmed from soviet spies

56:20.800 --> 56:26.880
in new mexico tipping off stalling to the roswell crash where stalling allegedly gathered the ussr's

56:26.960 --> 56:32.480
rightus to discuss the captured saucer quote some of the items found and analyzed by the russians

56:32.480 --> 56:37.840
possess a similarity of items gathered in the united states others closely resemble material

56:37.840 --> 56:43.600
collected by the us army soon after the crash end quote impactful statement as recently dr

56:43.600 --> 56:49.280
eric davis confirmed the soviets did indeed observe and collect at least one crash retrieval

56:49.280 --> 56:54.800
in their own territory it is unknown how exactly corso came across this intelligence regarding

56:54.800 --> 57:01.040
the soviets but it is no surprise after the words of david grush grush says the united states is not

57:01.040 --> 57:08.720
the only country that's encountered nhi and their technology he says our geo political rivals have

57:08.720 --> 57:15.760
their own crash retrieval programs which they are also secretly exploiting for military purposes

57:15.760 --> 57:21.520
we're in a competition with their adversaries to understand this and it's a it's a multi-decade

57:21.520 --> 57:28.480
cold war that uh has been under our nose for so long and you know there is no good way to level

57:28.480 --> 57:34.480
the playing field and hold other nation states accountable if they're doing unethical or illicit

57:34.480 --> 57:40.880
activity as it relates to this subject however far down the line in 1993 corso would ask old

57:40.880 --> 57:46.640
acquaintances to acquire about recovered materials from a kgb general while much of the information

57:47.040 --> 57:54.560
held as top secret by kgb and gru corso was given a list of materials you can see on screen now

57:54.560 --> 58:00.000
let's temper our expectations as this list could easily have been disinformation given to corso

58:00.000 --> 58:06.320
however one piece that stands out to me was a silvery tube found in the us in 1975 i wonder

58:06.320 --> 58:12.960
if this possibly relates to the august 1974 chiwawa mexico crash i covered in which a us rapid

58:13.040 --> 58:18.960
recovery team relieved a deceased mexican army squadron of a recovered craft possibly the soviets

58:18.960 --> 58:24.480
traced this recovery and found materials missed by the convoy the foreign technology division

58:24.480 --> 58:30.320
was working with lasers anti-missile missiles and directed energy weapons near the tail end of

58:30.320 --> 58:36.800
corso's career lieutenant general trudeau retired in 1962 and the lieutenant colonel followed him

58:36.800 --> 58:47.920
shortly in 1963 now what more can we learn about the foreign technology division and general

58:47.920 --> 58:53.680
arthur trudeau trudeau is a member of the military intelligence hall of fame the general served in

58:53.680 --> 58:59.280
world war two in the korean war trudeau served as chief of army intelligence but was relieved by

58:59.280 --> 59:06.320
alan dolas director of the cia possibly for his extremely rigorous anti-communist stance the general

59:06.320 --> 59:13.520
was shortly reinstated and eventually in 1958 the golden age of army r&d began according to corso

59:13.520 --> 59:19.280
trudeau would then return to washington as director of army research and development the general was

59:19.280 --> 59:25.520
so influential to the army he was one of eight former generals included in the army's 1970s oral

59:25.520 --> 59:30.880
history project funny enough when trudeau was interviewed for this project corso was found

59:30.880 --> 59:36.160
to be spending time with his friend trudeau in his kitchen this speaks to the close relationship

59:36.160 --> 59:41.920
of the two and their friendship during and after their service and outside of corso we have only

59:41.920 --> 59:47.920
one interesting piece to link the general to uap let's remember all the way back to forbidden

59:47.920 --> 59:53.840
science where dr eric davis claimed bush senior stated he was indeed briefed by trudeau at the

59:53.840 --> 01:00:00.240
1968 mendel rivers congressional hearings now i'm sure many are familiar with the united

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:06.320
states air forces foreign technology division that operated out of right patterson from 1961

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:14.800
to 1991 to reiterate the office created by trudeau and chiefed by corso was not this infamous division

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:21.520
the air force program evolved from air technical intelligence center in 1961 and was a sign under

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:27.600
air force systems command the division reportedly operated on recovered russian mig jets however

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:33.120
due to the stove piping of ufo legacy programs it would not be shocking to think perhaps this

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.960
program also engaged with technologies of unknown origins parallel to its army department

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:46.320
let's reference us army colonel john b alexander's book ufo's myths conspiracies and realities

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:52.000
i know i've had my problems with alexander before and his discussion of the som 101 majestic

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.160
12 special operations manual however this quote is important quote corso stated that he had been

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.800
transferred back to the pentagon under trudeau and a division had been created for him called the

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.080
foreign technology division this is not to be confused with the large foreign technology division

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.120
of the u.s air force at right patterson ohio it was learned that the army foreign technology

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:18.240
division was formed as corso stated and then disappeared shortly after his retirement end

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:24.480
this is a fascinating point as after general trudeau four star general dwight e beach took

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:30.880
over command of army rnd and from there on out we find nothing of foreign technology division

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:38.160
why is this army rnd office proven to exist yet zero foya documents newspapers or online articles

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:43.520
exist about the correct program numerous references can be found to the air forces foreign

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.520
technology division but not the armies i find this very similar to the army's interplanetary

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:55.200
phenomenon unit which was discovered through foya to exist only throughout institutional memory in

01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:01.440
the army i do believe this inability to track down the army's foreign technology division to be of

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:08.160
extreme consequence if corso's testimony is indeed true there is much value we can extract here

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:14.880
regarding uap legacy program operations this would mean the office of the chief of army rnd

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.960
created a very real program hidden and shadowed from the public eye by the publicity of its big

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:26.400
air force brother at right patterson throughout the manuscript corso would even comment passively

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:31.680
on this difference stating project moon dust and blue fly reported materials and intelligence

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.640
directly to the air forces foreign technology division out of right pad and we can do some

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:42.720
really interesting research by reading a primer on research and development in the us army we can

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:49.840
see in 1958 under trudeau the army established the army research office under the ocrd due to pressure

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:56.880
from civilian scientists which served as a single contact in the army to maximize army rnd efficiency

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:03.920
remember corso stated army rnd truly began to flourish in 1958 when army began doing rnd away

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:09.440
from civilian and institutions with prime eyes one can then reason the foreign technology

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:15.280
division may have run parallel to the aro army research office out of civilian and congressional

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.720
oversight this reasoning can be further supported when the document states the army chief of rnd

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:26.480
would have a parallel line of authority to handle technical services on matters in his area this

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.760
would in turn give the chief of rnd trudeau authority on assignment of key personnel

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:39.120
and allocation of rnd funds to technical services this rnd primer document also reveals some startling

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:45.200
revelations the army's initial needs for managing rnd efforts led to the creation of university

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:52.880
research initiatives u r i's independent laboratory in-house research i l i r and independent

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:59.120
research and development programs irads some of you may remember irads as a funding mechanism for

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:06.400
legacy programs mentioned by david grush furthermore these u r i and i l i r programs would eventually

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:12.800
lead to u a r c and f f r d c two types of military and federally controlled semi-private

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:19.360
groups that likely operate heavily with ufo legacy programs what a fascinating document there is

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:25.600
absolutely more to explore here such as the thesis of how legacy program architecture was born out of

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:37.360
army rnd i do want to spend some time visiting some of the smaller aspects to corso's disclosures

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.640
we glossed over discussing the manuscript corso additionally made some extremely interesting

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:49.200
claims regarding some information he gathered long after his service corso allegedly learned that in

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:55.920
february of 1987 colonel herald e phillips of the defense intelligence agency chaired a pentagon

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:02.000
group called the ufo working group this group apparently still in existence at the time of the

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.840
manuscripts writing in 1993 originally consisted of 17 men one army and three air force generals

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:16.320
di a scientists an army colonel three nsa officials a supervisor from the cia's domestic

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:21.520
collection division as well as a technical team from the cia's science and technology director

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:27.600
it well for one where is the navy here as the navy is likely up to its eyeballs in ufo legacy

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:33.120
programs such as the off-world technologies division housed at the naval surface warfare

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:40.320
center in crane indiana it seems strange that between 1987 and 1993 corso and his ufo working

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:45.120
group intelligence source would not know or not make mention to the navy's dealings in

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:50.720
uap legacy programs but let's go back to the mention of the cia's science and technology

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:58.000
directorate and how it is of extreme importance here by numerous accounts the cia ds and t is

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.560
where the quote unquote ufo portfolio is held according to eric davis as well as chris sharp

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:10.160
and many others the director of this position glenn gaffney was the individual who stopped

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:18.720
lockheed martin from divesting uap material to osap in 2008 additionally former cia ds and t deputy

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:25.680
director dug wolf helped create the cia office of global access in 2003 which was accused by

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:31.600
excellent journalist chris sharp as serving as a logistics coordinator agency alongside jsoc

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:38.320
joint special operations command for uap crash retrieval corso was way ahead of his time to

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:43.920
make mention to this this ufo working group according to corso also received funding from

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:50.560
us army inscom intelligence and security command founder major general albert stubblebein in the

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:55.680
last few projects i have done i have talked at length about stubblebein and his likely work in

01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:02.720
uap legacy programs including fort hachuka in the 1960s stubblebein was also allegedly the man who

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:10.160
tried to pay off steven greer in the 1990s and the alleged founder of the nsa's men in black treat

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.960
tactical reconnaissance engineering assessment team we'll skip over this for now as we cover

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:21.600
this in-depth with edgar fuchet and the flying triangle arvs but for now how about this inscom

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:27.920
special forces unit the illustrious intelligence support activity isa was handed over to jsoc in

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:35.040
2003 the same year wolf constructed the cia office of global access which allegedly used jsoc for

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:42.560
uap retrievals isa is often known as the most secretive and clandestine of jsoc units even

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:50.160
outside of the ufo working group just how intimate is us army inscom with legacy programs and does

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:56.240
this working group not sound very similar to a majestic 12 leg structure let's take this time

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:01.600
to briefly point out another distinction between the book and the manuscript in day after roswell

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:07.760
claims are made of working adjacent to roscoe hill encoder and the infamous majestic 12 personnel

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:13.520
list under eisenhower and truman dawn of a new age sees corso recognizing the eisenhower briefing

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:18.320
document report but how he never saw the report at the nsc and white house

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:28.480
the vast majority of criticism against corso comes from analysis of the day after roswell

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:34.400
and his claims of technology ceding the lieutenant colonel's military accolades are beyond question

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.520
we have already addressed the stark differences between the manuscript and the book the book

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:46.000
clearly added myriad details to spice up the story of corso the manuscript is well it's tough

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.600
reading but it gives us an unbridled look into corso's experiences the manuscript was also

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.160
completed prior to the release of the day after roswell colonel alexander and others were shown

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:01.360
the completed manuscript around the time of the book's release while alexander jock valet and

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:06.240
others are still very critical of corso's they all maintain the lieutenant colonel's story

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:13.360
never wavered details were never altered added or subtracted corso sounded like a tape recorder

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:18.160
you could rewind or fast forward to parts of his disclosures and always hear the same details

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:24.640
never any wavering allegedly corso had but 24 hours to edit the day after roswell book which

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:31.280
led to no oversight on all the creative liberties in the piece one must ask why the subject of this

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:37.680
non-fiction book was stripped of all creative control of the project in his book john b alexander

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:42.640
details a letter he wrote to corso about all the issues related to the day after roswell

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:47.040
mind you these criticisms are all leveraged towards the book still interesting to keep in

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:52.320
mind and i highly recommend looking at this nonetheless link in the description many discrepancies

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.280
regarding technology seeding has been thrown at corso some of which we have already addressed

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:02.080
jock valet for example well versed in computer science stated corso's assertions regarding

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:08.160
integrated circuitry were not documented facts colonel alexander himself had specific issues

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:13.680
with the passive night vision system mentioned by corso alexander stated the genealogy of

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:19.200
infrared and nvg technology can all be accounted for alexander detailed how he spoke to the

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:24.560
director of night vision laboratory at fort belvoir virginia dr lou cameron who flatly

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:30.880
denied how an eye lens of nhi aided in passive night vision breakthroughs legendary researcher

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:37.040
stanton freedman was also extremely critical of corso associating him with bob lasar which in

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.800
my opinion regardless of skepticism against corso is very inappropriate freedman criticized

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.480
corso for his grand story absent of evidence this is a viewpoint i can absolutely empathize with

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:55.840
but what does stanton have to say now entirely differently in terms of background lieutenant

01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:02.320
colonel philip j corso came out with the book on the 50th anniversary of roswell first published

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:11.680
right in roswell called the day after roswell in which he claims that when he was at the foreign

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.720
technology desk of the army research and development command at the pentagon under general trudeau

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:23.040
he surreptitiously slipped the filing cabinet full of advanced technology wreckage from roswell

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:30.160
into the hands of american industry and he saved the world that's how we got kevlar and

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:37.840
micro integrated circuits and a whole long list of things and uh it was a great story

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:46.160
and the forward of the book was by senator strong thurman the oldest serving member of the senate

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:52.960
who said nice things about corso but in his intro his forward says nothing about roswell

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:59.200
in his manuscript and book corso was indeed what you could describe egotistical but in his

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:05.520
memoirs he never once claimed to have been some sort of world savior he was very patriotic and

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:10.560
simply aimed to strengthen the army this is obviously not freedman's fault as the book

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:17.120
was his only available analysis on corso at the time well they make a very long story short when

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:23.440
you start checking on colonel corso lieutenant colonel corso things just don't check out he provides no

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.800
validation for any other claims there's no index in the book either they say new

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:35.680
documents finally released there's nothing new in there uh and many people have gone through i

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:43.040
know one phd who was a colonel in the military who sent me a list of 92 false claims made in the book

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:49.760
92 i mean just technically wrong all over the place well you can blame that on the co-author

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:57.600
maybe but uh some of the discoveries of physicists just won a nobel prize for example for work done

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.440
three years before corso was connected with the army research and development group

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:10.240
he's a nice gentleman i met him while he was alive uh but his claims

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:19.520
senator thurman withdrew his forward wasn't in the next edition of the book because it was written

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:25.280
for an entirely different book about corso's activities corso talked about the fbi his good

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:31.360
buddy hoover when his fbi file was released uh hoover had nothing but bad things to say about

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:37.680
corso now it muddied the waters and got a lot of attention why would such a distinguished

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.720
military man well the real military people will tell you he only made lieutenant colonel after

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:50.080
22 years in a lot of lieutenant colonels not nearly as many full colonels so it's another

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:56.640
example of taking advantage opportunism if you will uh he also claimed that he was a member of

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:01.040
the national security council and a sworn statement for a lawyer was going to go after the government

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:06.880
and spill out all colonel corso's files well i checked with the eisenhower library not only

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.760
was never a member of the national security council which is very prestigious indeed he never

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.680
attended a meeting of the national security council he was a liaison between the security

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:24.960
council and some other groups uh it doesn't help ufology to have this kind of thing going on

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:35.280
people accept a great deal and his book sold well but i'm sorry it isn't what it claims to be

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:43.680
it's not a real expose of the truth about roswell and flying saucers and government's new technology

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:51.680
cut now in july of 2024 john greenwald and the black vault published documents released by

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:58.160
the fbi on corso and no no documents discussing ufo's a portion of these documents pertain to

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:04.560
in 1964 to 65 fbi background check on corso for his perspective position on the immigration

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.000
and national security subcommittee of the house of representatives corso had allegedly provided

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.800
some unfounded claims in the past according to these documents delivering a list of fabian

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:21.040
socialists to his good friend arthur trudeau the fbi was unable to validate these claims

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:26.880
corso was also investigated for spreading claims garnered from cia sources that lee harvey oswald

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:34.000
assassin of jfk was an fbi informant now oswald being either an fbi or cia informant probably

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.080
does not seem too unlikely to everybody regarding a soviet defector michael gullinowski the fbi

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:46.320
document state quote another government agency has characterized corso as a parasite who has never

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:52.000
produced any intelligence through his own efforts but has profited from information developed by

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.840
dedicated government agents and investigators end quote all of these critical files on corso

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:04.080
were cross references and not main files meaning the fbi never officially investigated corso

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:10.240
from these files it does appear corso liked to quote unquote waste the fbi's time making

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:16.160
accusations no content here actually discusses his duties with the foreign technology division

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:22.000
let alone the army and of course it is odd the selection of documents released when they were

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.720
released why are there no documents on corso's army position and why are there no documents on

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:33.280
the foreign technology division my greatest issue with corso arises from a massive firsthand

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:38.880
experience relegated to the very end of his manuscript remember corso claimed to have

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:45.600
witnessed an extraterrestrial body in 1947 observed ufo's on radar at ballistic missile sites in

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:51.840
1958 and 1959 and eventually studied materials recovered from uap crashes for the foreign

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.200
technology division corso's affidavit says as much without reference to the nike missile site

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.880
encounters however at the end of this manuscript corso recounts an incident while in command of

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:09.440
a missile silo at white sands missile range corso claimed while driving alone in an isolated area

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:15.120
he sought shelter from the heat in an abandoned mine within the mine he claimed to have encountered

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:21.680
face to face a bean of non-human intelligence the bean was drawn in corso's manuscript and

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:27.440
communicated to him telepathically we can also see him relay drawings of this bean in a long

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:33.520
lost interview featured on weaponized with george nap the bean wished to leave the surrounding area

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:38.320
however active radar interference from nearby installations were preventing its craft's

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:44.080
departure a common theory by corso and some roswell researchers is radar systems interfered

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:50.240
with craft navigation leading to crashes i am still very skeptical on this point corso

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:56.240
asked the bean what he would get in return for lowering the radar coverage the bean responded

01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:02.720
quote a new world if you can take it end quote corso would then grant the beans wish when he

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:08.480
returned to his installation this experience was so profound to him he would often contemplate the

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:14.960
meaning of the statement during life corso would even relay this story to john b alexander

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:22.640
george nap and possibly others including a film to his grandchildren somehow danie she hand saw

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:29.360
i i found to be extraordinarily important the the little eight millimeter home movie that uh

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:36.960
that uh kernel corso actually uh produced to be shown to his grandchildren after he died uh this

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:43.440
this is this i i found to be extraordinarily persuasive that he and i got to see the film uh

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:49.200
but it wasn't supposed to be shown till after he died and uh and i was shown the film uh and it

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:53.920
shows him talking to his grandchildren saying that even though i'm gone now i wanted to make sure

01:18:53.920 --> 01:19:02.080
you understood this and what he did is he talked about the fact that back in 1945 in july uh when

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:07.360
before we had even dropped the bombs on her ocean in nagasaki while they were experimenting

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:15.040
with the nuclear bomb uh out in the desert at ala migordo and white flats uh that in uh new

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:22.320
mexico he he in fact was one of the the security officers there uh and he said that they were seeing

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:29.120
ufo's he told his grandchildren uh from the from the grave basically on the bit on the little

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:35.120
eight millimeter home movie that he had been there and that saw the ufo's and that he took

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:40.560
a lunch break to go leave and went off into the hill somewhere to go to lunch and he saw one of

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:47.280
the craft that had landed uh it had been somehow disabled by the radar that was up all around

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:53.600
the proving grounds uh and that he had a direct contact with the ufo occupants of the vehicle

01:19:53.760 --> 01:20:01.120
and they they communicated to him telepathically to please take down the radar just temporarily

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:07.760
to allow them to flee uh and he actually did that he told his grandchildren he went back

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:14.720
and as a range officer ordered them to shut down the the radar for just a short time to do some kind

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:22.320
of recalibration of it and at that point the ufo craft fled uh shot off into the sky now that's

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:28.960
that's corso talking to his grandchildren in a in a private never intended to be made public

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:36.080
uh eight millimeter film and so i found that quite convincing about corso uh so when corso

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:42.080
reports that he was actually put into possession of some of the technology that had been recovered

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:47.760
from the raswell crash i tend to give it a considerable amount of credibility and the

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:54.960
fact that the the various uh aerospace uh corporations tried to set forth some sort

01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:00.000
of a long explanation about how they really developed the silicon chip they really developed

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:06.320
the fiber optics they really developed uh the other uh technology that corso attributes to the

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:11.840
raswell crash that's exactly what they would do there's not any doubt about it that they would

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.640
obfuscate and they would try to construct some sort of an alternative explanation for how they

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:23.120
developed themselves this technology and so i'm just saying that uh i find the corso uh a

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:29.680
testimony more credible than many people do i must be very clear here how shehan is indeed

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:35.200
incorrect about the 1945 date corso claimed this event occurred when commander of the ballistic

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:42.720
missile firing range at red canyon part of white sands this station was in 1957 to 1958 my issue

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:49.440
here is this is a truly consequential encounter if true initially i believed this passage to be a

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:55.040
dream or metaphor until i read more about how many others corso would tell this story to

01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:01.120
unfortunately this is an issue that plagues much of the ufo realm witnesses stating disclosures then

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:06.800
adding well and then this happened and then that happened far after their initial disclosures one

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:12.320
would imagine such an intimate encounter with a non-human intelligence biologic would be featured

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:18.000
in most of corso's disclosures make of this passage what you will however it does leave

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:24.160
somewhat of a sour taste in my mouth that such a dramatic encounter is relegated to the very back

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:31.760
part of his manuscript hey guys it's uap kerb thank you so much for joining me as we took this 90 plus

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:38.080
around 90 minute deep dive into the claims of lieutenant colonel philip j corso now before we

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.040
get started and kind of give this conclusion a lot of the time you'll see corso mentioned as

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:48.240
colonel philip j corso i have never once been able to verify that corso was indeed a full bird

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:53.920
colonel so thus i try to stay true to what i know as fact and what i've seen on his military records

01:22:53.920 --> 01:23:00.160
and call him lieutenant colonel philip j corso so the reason i took on this project quite often

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:06.720
i'll see people either pro corso or anti corso and much of their arguments crux on the day after

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:13.200
roswell book a lot of the people who disregard corso or put away his claims have a unsavory taste

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.560
in their mouth from the day after roswell whether that be to some of the unsubstantiated and wild

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:26.080
claims such as um corso forcing a cia guy to self-delete or some of the egotistical megalomania of

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:31.680
corso in the day after roswell book about him being a world savior and just some of the uh perfect

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:37.120
synchronicities of you know perfect descriptions of the roswell crash and rosco hillencoder and

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:43.120
the majestic 12 so i wanted to take a step back and read the pure manuscript dawn of a new age

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:49.280
of corso this is a 176 page manuscript if you ever watch this video again if you're interested

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:54.960
i do recommend reading the full thing however it is a very dreadful read most things are talked about

01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:01.280
eight or nine times throughout the manuscript so it can just be a trudge to get through now i

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:08.560
do notice that there are still some differences between corso's affidavit and the dawn of a new age

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:15.280
manuscript and this being the description of the encounter at white sands in 57 and 58 which we

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.200
just touched on in the end of the video of encountering a non-human intelligence with

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:25.600
almost a different physiognomy to the bean he claimed to have seen at fort riley in 1947 so

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:32.320
that that description still leaves a bit of a strange taste in my mouth due to reading it

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:38.800
after about 120 140 pages into the manuscript at first like i mentioned i did think it was

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:44.400
a metaphor a new world if you could take it something to teach his grandchildren to learn from

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:51.200
but corso is alleging that this is a true incident he not only wrote this in a film in his manuscript

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:57.440
in a film to his grandkids that somehow she hand saw but also told john b alexander joc velay and

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:03.440
george nap about this experience so let's kind of dive into some of the things i found very

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:08.400
interesting because i do think there's a lot of very credible statements made in the manuscript now

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:13.600
i cannot speak to the veracity of the technology ceding claims um i'm not an expert in integrated

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.760
circuitry i'm not an expert in computer science i'm not even an expert in metallurgy that was one of

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:23.680
my worst classes material science in the university so i cannot speak to that that is why i tried to

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:29.120
put a balanced take of course those claims and some traditional history but what we can speak on is

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:34.960
some of the factual accuracies of us army r&d at the time you know i know we analyzed that primer

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:41.600
quite a bit so it was fascinating to see kind of the army's need for a centralized r&d project

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.600
under trudeau spearheaded in 1958 just like corso said that's when the golden age of army r&d

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:53.360
began it was also very interesting to see back in the late fifties and early sixties the us army

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.400
was trying to kind of get with semi-private institutions and universities in order to um

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.080
flourish under army r&d this is something that we talked about quite often f of rdc's and ua rc's

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:09.040
and reverse engineering programs and legacy programs utilizing these sorts of institutions for

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:16.480
probably material study uh and so forth and also the foreign technology division this is

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:21.360
something i think is one of the most crucial aspects of this video that i've seen almost

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:27.440
nobody else talk about the foreign technology division under which corso worked was us army

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:34.400
not air force this is not the infamous foreign technology division out of right pat now we can

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:40.240
ask ourselves why is there no information about this foreign technology division why can we see

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:47.440
nothing about it except in the actual military documents under corso uh i myself have some foya

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:52.000
documents out to try to investigate for this further but as we've known with the interplanetary

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000
phenomenon unit with the us army there are some weird institutions that somehow exist through

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.200
institutional memory i'll be interested in to see if i can pry anything free from foya regarding

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:08.880
the army's foreign technology division however my hopes aren't necessarily high that being that if

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:14.640
this was indeed one of the first structured us legacy programs i'm sure we'll get no information

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:22.720
and i do want to touch on that because if corso's claims are indeed true and i look favorably upon

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:27.520
the claims of corso we'll just say that there's some claims that still bewilder me like the

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:35.600
nhi encounter and so forth but this program started in 1960 would likely be one of the first

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:42.000
structured us legacy programs utilizing corporations you know bell labs and some of the fortune 500

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.800
companies as well as universities and semi-private institutions so if these disclosures and testimonies

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:55.120
are indeed fact we can extract a lot of interesting data and worthwhile investigation here seeing how

01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:00.720
legacy programs were structured and framework and that is something that could extend to today which

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:06.800
i find highly likely seen as i do believe in modern day or at least the early 2000s the army's role

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:14.080
in legacy programs has often been r&d to try and equip the modern warfighter with um reverse

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.480
engineer technologies of unknown origin there will be a lot more to discuss on that in the future and

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:23.520
hopefully as we move on over time we can try and crack into some of these legacy programs and and

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:31.440
talking exactly what about the army air force navy does and what contractors work under them and so

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:36.880
forth speaking of contractors sperry rand wasn't that an interesting details the memoirs of trudeau

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:43.760
and discussed by corso one of the one of the companies they met with often was sperry rand and

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:48.480
when sperry rand went defunct i'm doing this off the top of my head which i believe was 86

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:56.640
much of their information and engineering divisions were bought up by rathion northrop honeywell

01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:02.960
and i believe rathion as well as bell labs i think one of the most interesting connections here

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:11.520
is bell labs being owned by atn t who in turn owned san had ownership of sandia national labs

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:17.120
under mandate by truman sandia is a usual suspect mentioned in the majestic documents mentioned by

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:22.240
edgar fuchsia mentioned in the interplanetary phenomenon unit documents that are still disputed

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:28.800
to this day so there's a lot of interesting data here to kind of analyze a hypothetical or very

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:35.120
much real us army reverse engineering program and speaking of that i'm also so fascinated by

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:40.880
corso's discussion of the ufo working group wasn't that interesting mentioning the cia

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:45.600
directorate of science and technology having a major position on this group of about 17

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:51.200
18 people on the board as we know with the work of chris sharp thank you chris sharp if you ever

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:57.600
watch one of my videos i'm honored you're you're an inspiration but that in 2003 cia oga served as

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:02.960
a logistics coordinator for ufo crash retrieval with the help of jsoc as we have just analyzed

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:08.000
the cia directorate of science and technology doug wolf spawned the oga and then us army

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:13.760
inscom and founder major albert major general albert stubble bind who corso said funded

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:20.400
the ufo working group under inscom in 2003 the isa the intelligent support activity

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:28.640
known sometimes as the activity the most clandestine of jsoc units was given over to jsoc and this was

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:34.800
all in 2003 around the time of the oga's creation which is allegedly the time the oga served as

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:40.080
logistics coordinator for crash retrieval if you don't know much about the isa i highly recommend

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:46.960
watching some videos on them they are some uh true bad people in terms of just their training and so

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:52.080
forth are really interesting i'm always interested in learning more about jsoc but i do want to know

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:57.040
what everybody thought about the video and corso after analyzing his claims in a vacuum purely

01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:01.920
analyzing his claims without any of the nonsense and extracurriculars from day after roswell what

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:07.120
does everybody think let's get a discussion going if you do not know i have a discord come join that

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:10.880
i'll have the link in the description uh we'll probably have some conversations going on about

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:15.360
corso and so forth because i would really like to talk about that if anybody has any experience

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:20.560
or other information on the foreign technology division let's get talking because i think that

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:28.160
if you take one single thing away from this video i i would like it to be that the army had an rnd

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:34.000
program in the 1960s called the foreign technology division that there are no documents and no

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:39.520
data for all we know is that trudeau followed upon his retirement in 62 by dwight e beach forced our

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:44.800
general um we're in command of us army are indeed the office of the chief of army research and

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:50.000
development so there are some kind of clues there for us to work on further but i hope everybody
