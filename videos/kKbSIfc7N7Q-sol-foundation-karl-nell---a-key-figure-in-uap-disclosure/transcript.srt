00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
On June 5th, 2023, the now legendary debrief article titled,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,040
Intelligence Officials Say U.S. Has Retrieved Craft of Non-Human Origin

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,880
by Leslie Keen and Ralph Blumenthal took the world by storm.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,880
This article introduced the world to David Grush and solidified the fact

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,640
the USG is in possession of craft of non-human origin

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,760
and actively attempts crash retrieval and reverse engineering of these anomalous vehicles.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,120
Within this article, one Carl Nell has mentioned, a now retired Army Colonel who worked with

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,560
Grush on the UAP Task Force. While Nell has one quote in this article supporting the assertions

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,800
of David Grush, he states an astounding fact, quote, his assertion concerning the existence

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,240
of a terrestrial arms race occurring subrosa over the past 80 years focused on reverse

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,640
engineering technologies of unknown origin is fundamentally correct, as is the indisputable

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,880
realization that at least some of these technologies of unknown origin derive from non-human intelligence.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,800
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and today I wanted to do a quick video talking about Carl Nell

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,280
and his crucial role in UAP disclosure. The importance of Nell's data and position on UAP

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,960
as detailed in his recent Soul Foundation symposium talk simply cannot be understated.

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,600
Guys, you know me, this is not just a reaction video of Nell's 31 minute talk at the Soul

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,680
Foundation. I've already picked out all the important parts I want to discuss, made the

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,320
proper connections, and so let's go through it. I'm not here to waste your time. Let's start.

19
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,680
Before we break down Colonel Nell's speech on the Soul Foundation on the Schumer Amendment and

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,200
the push for controlled disclosure, let's quickly cover what exactly the Soul Foundation is.

21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,920
The Soul Foundation is a group of scientists and academia folk,

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,040
military personnel, and government or policy makers that seek to educate the public on

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,720
academic legitimacy of UAP and push for a post-disclosure world. The Soul Foundation

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,760
includes figures whose credibility is beyond reproach, such as former depsec Christopher

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,400
Mellon, whistleblower David Grush, Stanford pathology professor Gary Nolan, PhD physicist

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,360
Kevin Knuth, Colonel Nell, and more. Nell spoke to the symposium in November 2023 at the Nolan

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,480
Laboratory of the Stanford School of Medicine, so let's break down and cover his key points.

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,480
If you have your finger on the pulse, you'll remember this speech happening and some apparent

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,080
leaked slides from his presentation, but it's not till February 2024 we've actually got to

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,600
see the whole presentation. Nell begins by breaking down the groundbreaking Schumer Amendment.

31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,960
Well, 10 years ago, probably the Schumer Amendment would have been viewed as a UAP UFO disclosure.

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,920
I've talked about this piece of legislation at length in almost every single one of my videos,

33
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,640
but thankfully Nell provides a comprehensive summary of this legislation. He goes on to discuss

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,680
background to the UAP Disclosure Act, citing the importance of Leslie Keane's article that

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,480
appeared on the 16th of December, 2017, bringing FLIR, Gimbal, and GoFast to the public domains as a

36
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,480
major paradigm shift. Nell thanks Chris Mellon and Lou Elizondo for their tireless work to get

37
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,240
these videos released and move the ball forward on UAP. So certainly that was a key incident.

38
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:28,720
The next piece was, I would argue, the David Grush, Ryan Graves, David Fraver testimony

39
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,360
before Congress, again lowering the threshold of making this topic respectable and incentivizing

40
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,560
some discussion about it. Two of the legislators that sponsored this bill are in the Gang of Eight.

41
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,800
The Gang of Eight includes the leaders of each of the two parties from the Senate and House of

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,200
Representatives, and the chairs of the ranking minority members of both the Senate Committee

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,720
and the House Committee for Intelligence as set forth by the 50 USC purpose. Certain members

44
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,560
of Congress are legally entitled to hear about all information pertaining to SAPs and secret programs.

45
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,040
Nell goes on to state the importance of the two members here, who are privy to

46
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,360
all read and access, yet have not been informed on UAP. Colonel Nell then goes on to talk about

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,000
the scope of the legislation and how changing reference terminology can start to strip away

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:26,000
the stigma. You know, shift UFO to UAP, USO to USP, flying saucer to UAP, and ETs to NHI.

49
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,240
I think this is a beautiful reference by the Colonel, as terms like UFO, flying saucer,

50
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,240
extraterrestrials even, are deeply ingrained in this stigma and are often scoffed at when mentioned,

51
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,960
but UAP, NHI are now termed an official legislation and must be taken seriously.

52
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,680
Take a look here at the now six characteristics of UAP referenced. I often reference the five as

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,560
listed by Lou Elizondo, but note item six, physical or invasive biological effects.

54
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,640
This is a fascinating addition likely brought to the table by Gary Nolan,

55
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,720
who is studying this aspect of the phenomenon. Think about the fear Wagan felt when he saw

56
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:16,720
the UFO craft, or something like Havana syndrome. The Schumer Amendment focuses specifically on UAP,

57
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,160
not TNO, as this graphic beautifully highlights unknown unknowns.

58
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,640
Let me read here what the actual legislation says, so we know specifically what they

59
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:36,160
intended with Schumer. UAP is any object operating or judge capable of operating in outer space,

60
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,200
the atmosphere, ocean surface, or undersea, lacking prosaic attribution,

61
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:48,560
due to performance characteristics and properties not previously known to be achievable

62
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,320
based upon commonly understood principles of physics. There's a massive difference between UAP

63
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,920
and TNO. And there's a huge distinction between these, and Schumer makes this explicit.

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:08,080
So TNO is a class of objects that temporarily resist prosaic attribution by the initial observer

65
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,440
due to performance or due to environmental or system limitations associated with the

66
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,840
observation process, but that nevertheless have a known accepted human origin.

67
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,120
So TNO is the stuff that you mistake at the time of observation, but you later figure out

68
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,840
like what it is. So if you look at Blue Book, you know, depending on the statistics you want to use,

69
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,720
the 94% or the 80% of what they spent their time on was TNO, was all explainable. The residuals.

70
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,640
To continue touching on the legislation here, NEL references a slide on the NDAA's Executive

71
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Summary. The key takeaway here is utilizing the National Archives to archive all UAP data.

72
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,240
NEL states what we are all thinking. Nobody necessarily trusts that's going to happen,

73
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,320
and I think. Therefore, the review board will provide oversight. Unlike the 1992 JFK Records

74
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,280
oversight, here NEL references the issue of materials, biological evidence of NHI and technology

75
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,120
of unknown origins. Thus, the Schumer Amendment allows for eminent domain of these materials.

76
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,960
Colonel NEL explains the terms NHI, legacy programs, prosaic attribution, and TuO that appear

77
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,200
specifically in the Schumer Amendment. He makes it apparent that the NDAA was searching specifically

78
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,920
for anything that is non-human related. These are terms of reference in the legislation. So

79
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,440
non-human intelligence, at least 18 times cited in there, any sentient intelligent non-human life

80
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,440
form, regardless of nature or ultimate origin that may be presumed responsible for UAP based on

81
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,600
the earlier definition, or of which the federal government has become aware. Legacy program,

82
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,680
all federal, state, local government, commercial industry, academic, private sector endeavors to

83
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,440
collect, exploit, versus engineer, TuO, or biological evidence of NHI. Prosaic attribution,

84
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,040
you remember this was in both of those terms, UAP and TNO. Prosaic attribution, having a human,

85
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:13,520
either foreign or domestic origin. So UAP is non-human, TNO human. Technology of unknown origin,

86
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,640
this is very important for the eminent domain clause. Any material or metamaterial, ejecta,

87
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,520
crash debris, mechanisms, machinery, equipment, assemblies, or sub-assemblies, engineering models

88
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,200
or processes, damage or intact aerospace vehicles, or damage or intact ocean surface or undersea

89
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:37,520
crap associated with UAP, or incorporating science and technology lacking prosaic attribution or known

90
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,480
means of human manufacture. The kernel then goes on to highlight arguments for and against

91
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,080
eminent domain of all UAP record and materials. And for those of you who don't know, eminent domain

92
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,880
is essentially the federal government's ability to take whatever they want, whenever they want.

93
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,000
What is interesting here is that some of the cons infringe on property ownership.

94
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,400
Here Nell is specifically referring to private corporations in possession of UAP and UAP material.

95
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,280
Nell moves on to make the key distinction between control disclosure

96
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,920
and catastrophic disclosure. This difference being control disclosure uses a campaigned plan,

97
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,200
and catastrophic disclosure is essentially the opening of the floodgates. All information

98
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,160
dumped out there by possibly an adversary or NHI themselves to create social disruption or other

99
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,800
means. Unfortunately the Schumer Rounds amendment was watered down and gutted by adversaries to

100
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,080
pro-disclosure. Hopefully this bill in its entirety will be released in the near future,

101
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:48,960
maybe the 2025 NDAA. Here Nell states reasons for and against non-disclosure. This is an extremely

102
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,040
intriguing slide and logically all six reasons make sense. National security implications,

103
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,720
lack of a credible plan, social disruption, covert agreements cover for misdeeds,

104
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,120
and organizational intrusion slash distraction from priorities.

105
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:12,240
We know from Grush an almost cold war has been conducted to keep knowledge of UAP from adversaries,

106
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,360
specifically China and Russia, addressing the national security risks posted here.

107
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,680
I am really interested in the new physics slash technologies that have unprecedented

108
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,840
ramifications for all human society. And look at the covert agreement section,

109
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:38,960
NHI quid pro quo. Is it possible and true that the USG has made deals or agreements with NHI,

110
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,600
as some people have suggested? And the cover for misdeeds, this is also addressed by Grush.

111
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,000
Part of the reason for the cover up is in fact feudalistic dominance,

112
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,160
and numerous crimes including murder have been conducted to keep these secrets.

113
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,960
But now take a look at the cons or essentially pro-disclosure agreements.

114
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,840
Under prevent loss of technological dominance here, look at, some evidence suggests the USA

115
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:10,880
may be losing a UAP arms race. If this is true and Russia or China are near breakthroughs of

116
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:18,720
harnessing NHI, this has global power shift levels of implications. As Nell states, all of these

117
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,640
issues are better solved in an academic sector and are largely not government issues besides

118
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,560
the cold war and arms race. And now we arrive to Nell's famous slide which partially leaked back

119
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:38,880
in November 2023 titled, Way Forward UAP Campaign Plan Lines of Effort. This slide is

120
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,640
absurdly perplexing so let's break it down. To reach a post-disclosure world with proper

121
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,560
oversight restored, catastrophic disclosure avoided, and scientific understanding advanced?

122
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,840
Nell envisions a campaign with five major phases through four major channels, the public sector,

123
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,840
philosophical investigation, scientific research, and the private sector.

124
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,040
Phase zero consists of shaping the narrative around UAP which was done successfully by ATIP,

125
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:16,080
DOD videos, the 2017 New York Times article, and UAP Task Force. Notice guys how Arrow is not listed

126
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,600
here, I'm sure Sean Kirkpatrick is seething. Phase one, which has a targeted end date of

127
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,480
January 1st 2024 seems all but complete, ending with the Schumer legislation. Government acceptance

128
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:36,160
has been achieved, UAP is now largely a bipartisan issue, and reactive hypothesis generation is popping

129
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,160
up such as the newly published paper claiming that some UAP are plasma-based pre-life.

130
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,160
Phase two aims to correlate signatures by January 1st 2026, garnering a more stringent approach

131
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,360
and harnessing of academia like the Soul Foundation is doing.

132
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,520
Likely due to the stigma persisting around serious academic research, this phase is still at risk.

133
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,040
Phase three plans to be completed by October 1st 2030 and is seen as an inflection point by Nell,

134
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,800
possibly serving as the disclosure point for humanity. This phase seeks public acceptance,

135
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,680
which is a tall ask if you ask me. Phase four to be completed by the 1st of October 2034

136
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:27,040
aims to fully answer the five W's, who, what, when, where, and why. This phase is off-target,

137
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,560
and finally phase five has an indefinite timeline, looking for an interactive approach with UAP in

138
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:40,960
a strategic end state, possibly meaning integrating NHI and NHI technology with our earth and civilization.

139
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,320
Nell has a couple ideas for each of the four channels and how they can lead to a post-disclosure

140
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,040
world. So this is the government line of effort. Pass Schumer, grant legal amnesty,

141
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,000
centralized the data, create a Manhattan project to address this area, sponsor National Science

142
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,440
Foundation grants, charter an NIE, National Intel Estimate to assess the public-private

143
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,480
positions of every country with this topic and where they are with it, and use that to tee up

144
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,160
a United Nations summit or World Congress on developing new norms of behavior in this context.

145
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,120
I think we need a sociological model for analyzing the societal impact for disclosure

146
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,240
and then developing mitigation strategies a priori to address that. Now, some people think

147
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,480
that maybe less of a concern or more of a concern is kind of irrelevant, like it's an unknown right

148
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,120
now, but we need a plan to address it to lower that concern. Codify the laws of ethics in an

149
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,680
environment where we might have a hierarchy of being, where everyone isn't necessarily

150
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,920
having equal competitive potential. How do you, it's essentially translating

151
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,800
our special relativity version of ethics to a general relativity version of ethics,

152
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,200
where you've got the problem of a more advanced civilization coming in and disrupting a less

153
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,480
advanced civilization, developing theoretical as well as practical methods to analyze metamaterials.

154
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,080
And let's get to the point where we can actually talk about utilizing the, what is it, 339 isotopes

155
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,360
and engineering materials out of that instead of the 118 elements that were been sort of limited

156
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,000
to. We need to work in the business utility of forming consortiums to actually look at this

157
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,400
material if the government was actually going to make it available. Codify presence and legal

158
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,120
standards for determining intellectual property rights over the material, analyzing economic

159
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,000
incentives and the impact to the economy if new energy sources were developed.

160
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,040
Nell's presentation is poignant and powerful with astounding implications, but we can go a

161
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,840
little deeper here. Now let's visit two backup slides not shown on Nell's presentation as provided

162
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:52,640
by Matthew Pines. The first of these slides looks to replace the Kardashev Scale. I talked about

163
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,920
this in part two of my iceberg, but essentially the Kardashev Scale benchmarks the technological

164
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,160
capabilities of a civilization and places them into three types. A planetary civilization that

165
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,760
is able to harness all the energy from their home planet, a stellar civilization which is able to

166
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,080
harness all of the energy from its host star, and a galactic civilization which is able to

167
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:23,280
harness the complete energy output of its home galaxy. We are currently in estimated 0.72 on

168
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:31,200
the Kardashev Scale. Look at this line. Since it is not implausible, given the diversity of UAP

169
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,920
sightings, that numerous civilizations may be interacting concurrently. That is just such

170
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,720
an intriguing thought, but this new scale looks to develop a universal civilization development

171
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,320
datum to try and forecast NHI motives based on attributes. Instead of just a sliding scale,

172
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,400
this is a new multivariable system in which what they are, what they know, and who they are,

173
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:04,000
are gauged and plotted. The end states for these civilizations are quite astounding.

174
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,600
Spacetime manipulation, understanding reality, and immortality slash physical transcendence

175
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:18,160
are the three kind of variable reference points of these civilizations. I am honestly

176
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,320
blown away by this slide, the proposed taxonomy of UAP and origin hypothesis,

177
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,320
and struggle to know where to even start. UAP, hypothesis, and NHI are broken up here into

178
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:38,000
three main categories, physical, psychophysical, and metaphysical. Within the physical are origins

179
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
that span from expected to downright bizarre. We have, of course, our natural phenomena, humans,

180
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,080
inner galactic, ETs, and even proto-humans, but then we also have stranded gods,

181
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,640
unknown regions of spacetime, disconnected hyperspace, the 3D avatars, or holograms,

182
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,400
as Grush once mentioned with the holographic universe. Within physical we even get weirder,

183
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,040
with colliding universes, parallel universes, macro quantum fluctuations,

184
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,800
pan-galactic entanglement, and distance recursion. And now we get the medical physical,

185
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:22,320
in which supernatural forces, incorporeal life forms, ascended masters, angelic or demonic

186
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,400
beings, artificial realities, and more are mentioned. This is wild stuff, and actually,

187
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,120
thinking of some fun, please let me know if you would like me to do a tier list on these proposed

188
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,120
taxonomies. Just my personal opinion on all these topics, but of course that could be an

189
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:44,000
absolute blast because I'll tell you right now, I identify more with the physical range of explanations

190
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,840
and not just the, you know, pretty standard stuff, but I'd like to get into that.

191
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:55,120
Things with Nell couldn't get any weirder, right? But what if I told you he was one of the 40 first

192
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,000
hand witness whistleblowers that Grush interviewed? Check out this Leslie Cain clip.

193
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:18,240
David Grush said in his testimony that he talked to 40 people over four years,

194
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,840
all of whom had information on a secret military program that has non-human craft and remains.

195
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,760
Is it surprising to you that none of those 40 people has spoken out?

196
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,120
It is, it actually isn't Elizabeth. I mean, as some of them have, one of them actually

197
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,680
was in our article in the debrief, a former Army colonel named Carl Nell. I think maybe some of

198
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,400
them have spoken out a little bit and we just don't maybe put it all together, but it really

199
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,760
isn't surprising because of the repercussions that people face. And Dave Grush is an example of that.

200
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,160
He talked a little bit of in the hearing yesterday about the repercussions that he's faced, which

201
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,640
are very harmful to him, both personally and professionally for speaking out. So I think others

202
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,880
have the same concerns and they've seen it happen to him. They want to wait and make sure it's safe

203
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,520
for them to come forward and not have to face the same kinds of things that David Grush faced.

204
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,560
Yeah, can you elaborate on that? And he just said he had some.

205
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,680
I'd like to thank Twitter Ace UAP News at highpeak77 for making a thread on this.

206
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,120
In Colonel Nells LinkedIn bio, he served as the technical intelligence operations officer for the

207
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,200
DIA. Here states, quote, first person deployed from the DIA directorate of intelligence production

208
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,360
and analysis to participate in multi-agency planning for Operation Iraqi Freedom as the

209
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:44,640
foreign materials program command representative to U.S. CENTCOM slash CFLCC in Kuwait.

210
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,520
Served as the C slash J2 for the one star combined joint captured material exploitation

211
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,880
center in Iraq. And as we know from Schellenberger's article, dozens of government whistleblowers

212
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,720
have given testimony to Congress Pentagon and Inspector General says sources that there have

213
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,000
been ongoing crash retrieval programs of both foreign vehicles and UAP. Could Nells role in

214
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,120
this Iraq mission? Seeing him encounter a downed UAP leading to his first hand witness testimony,

215
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,480
I got a lot more to dive into here. So stay tuned. But thank you again, UAP News for that Twitter

216
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,600
thread. Hey guys, I know this video turned out almost as long as Colonel Nells talk itself.

217
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,800
But still, I thought it important to try and break down everything that he said in this

218
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,800
soul symposium. I hope you guys enjoyed this breakdown. There's a lot of other interesting

219
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,640
talks from this soul foundation event I want to go through, including grushes, Chris Melons,

220
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,480
Kevin Knuths, Gary Nolan, Jacques Valais as well. So if you guys like this, stay tuned for that.

221
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:57,600
I had a lot of fun making this. I hope you don't mind the not kind of reaction style. I wanted to

222
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,520
watch this and make sure I had all my thoughts first before I reported information to everybody,

223
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,600
not do kind of a not much effort, watch through together. So I hope you enjoyed it just a quick

224
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,080
video today. Please remember to like and subscribe and I will catch you guys on the next video. Thank you.
