Karl Nell's Discussion at the SOL Foundation focusing on the Schumer Amendment and Controlled Disclosure. \n\nFor those who don't know, the SOL Foundation is a group of scientists/academia, military personnel, and government/policymakers that seek to educate the public on the academic legitimacy of UAP and push for a post-disclosure world. The SOL Foundation includes figures whose credibility is beyond reproach such as former depsec Christopher Melon, whistleblower David Grusch, Stanford Pathology Professor Gary Knolan, PhD Physicist Kevin Knuth, Nell, and more!\n\nIn his talk, Nell tells shocking revelations regarding legislation and controlled disclosure campaigns around the UFO/UAP phenomena. I found Nell's discussion incredibly insightful and powerful so I wanted to share a deep dive with all of you!\n\nWe don't stop at just his speech....
