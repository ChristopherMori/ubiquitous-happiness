00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
On June 5th, 2023, the now legendary debrief article titled,

00:04.400 --> 00:09.040
Intelligence Officials Say U.S. Has Retrieved Craft of Non-Human Origin

00:09.040 --> 00:12.880
by Leslie Keen and Ralph Blumenthal took the world by storm.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.880
This article introduced the world to David Grush and solidified the fact

00:16.880 --> 00:20.640
the USG is in possession of craft of non-human origin

00:20.640 --> 00:25.760
and actively attempts crash retrieval and reverse engineering of these anomalous vehicles.

00:25.840 --> 00:31.120
Within this article, one Carl Nell has mentioned, a now retired Army Colonel who worked with

00:31.120 --> 00:36.560
Grush on the UAP Task Force. While Nell has one quote in this article supporting the assertions

00:36.560 --> 00:42.800
of David Grush, he states an astounding fact, quote, his assertion concerning the existence

00:42.800 --> 00:48.240
of a terrestrial arms race occurring subrosa over the past 80 years focused on reverse

00:48.240 --> 00:54.640
engineering technologies of unknown origin is fundamentally correct, as is the indisputable

00:54.640 --> 01:00.880
realization that at least some of these technologies of unknown origin derive from non-human intelligence.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.800
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and today I wanted to do a quick video talking about Carl Nell

01:06.800 --> 01:13.280
and his crucial role in UAP disclosure. The importance of Nell's data and position on UAP

01:13.280 --> 01:18.960
as detailed in his recent Soul Foundation symposium talk simply cannot be understated.

01:19.120 --> 01:25.600
Guys, you know me, this is not just a reaction video of Nell's 31 minute talk at the Soul

01:25.600 --> 01:29.680
Foundation. I've already picked out all the important parts I want to discuss, made the

01:29.680 --> 01:34.320
proper connections, and so let's go through it. I'm not here to waste your time. Let's start.

01:34.880 --> 01:39.680
Before we break down Colonel Nell's speech on the Soul Foundation on the Schumer Amendment and

01:39.680 --> 01:45.200
the push for controlled disclosure, let's quickly cover what exactly the Soul Foundation is.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.920
The Soul Foundation is a group of scientists and academia folk,

01:49.920 --> 01:55.040
military personnel, and government or policy makers that seek to educate the public on

01:55.040 --> 02:00.720
academic legitimacy of UAP and push for a post-disclosure world. The Soul Foundation

02:00.720 --> 02:05.760
includes figures whose credibility is beyond reproach, such as former depsec Christopher

02:05.760 --> 02:12.400
Mellon, whistleblower David Grush, Stanford pathology professor Gary Nolan, PhD physicist

02:12.400 --> 02:19.360
Kevin Knuth, Colonel Nell, and more. Nell spoke to the symposium in November 2023 at the Nolan

02:19.360 --> 02:24.480
Laboratory of the Stanford School of Medicine, so let's break down and cover his key points.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.480
If you have your finger on the pulse, you'll remember this speech happening and some apparent

02:28.480 --> 02:34.080
leaked slides from his presentation, but it's not till February 2024 we've actually got to

02:34.080 --> 02:39.600
see the whole presentation. Nell begins by breaking down the groundbreaking Schumer Amendment.

02:39.680 --> 02:44.960
Well, 10 years ago, probably the Schumer Amendment would have been viewed as a UAP UFO disclosure.

02:45.520 --> 02:49.920
I've talked about this piece of legislation at length in almost every single one of my videos,

02:49.920 --> 02:56.640
but thankfully Nell provides a comprehensive summary of this legislation. He goes on to discuss

02:56.640 --> 03:01.680
background to the UAP Disclosure Act, citing the importance of Leslie Keane's article that

03:01.680 --> 03:08.480
appeared on the 16th of December, 2017, bringing FLIR, Gimbal, and GoFast to the public domains as a

03:08.480 --> 03:14.480
major paradigm shift. Nell thanks Chris Mellon and Lou Elizondo for their tireless work to get

03:14.480 --> 03:20.240
these videos released and move the ball forward on UAP. So certainly that was a key incident.

03:20.240 --> 03:28.720
The next piece was, I would argue, the David Grush, Ryan Graves, David Fraver testimony

03:28.720 --> 03:35.360
before Congress, again lowering the threshold of making this topic respectable and incentivizing

03:35.360 --> 03:40.560
some discussion about it. Two of the legislators that sponsored this bill are in the Gang of Eight.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.800
The Gang of Eight includes the leaders of each of the two parties from the Senate and House of

03:44.800 --> 03:49.200
Representatives, and the chairs of the ranking minority members of both the Senate Committee

03:49.200 --> 03:54.720
and the House Committee for Intelligence as set forth by the 50 USC purpose. Certain members

03:54.720 --> 04:00.560
of Congress are legally entitled to hear about all information pertaining to SAPs and secret programs.

04:01.360 --> 04:05.040
Nell goes on to state the importance of the two members here, who are privy to

04:05.040 --> 04:11.360
all read and access, yet have not been informed on UAP. Colonel Nell then goes on to talk about

04:11.360 --> 04:16.000
the scope of the legislation and how changing reference terminology can start to strip away

04:16.000 --> 04:26.000
the stigma. You know, shift UFO to UAP, USO to USP, flying saucer to UAP, and ETs to NHI.

04:26.880 --> 04:32.240
I think this is a beautiful reference by the Colonel, as terms like UFO, flying saucer,

04:32.240 --> 04:38.240
extraterrestrials even, are deeply ingrained in this stigma and are often scoffed at when mentioned,

04:38.800 --> 04:44.960
but UAP, NHI are now termed an official legislation and must be taken seriously.

04:44.960 --> 04:51.680
Take a look here at the now six characteristics of UAP referenced. I often reference the five as

04:51.680 --> 04:58.560
listed by Lou Elizondo, but note item six, physical or invasive biological effects.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.640
This is a fascinating addition likely brought to the table by Gary Nolan,

05:02.640 --> 05:08.720
who is studying this aspect of the phenomenon. Think about the fear Wagan felt when he saw

05:08.720 --> 05:16.720
the UFO craft, or something like Havana syndrome. The Schumer Amendment focuses specifically on UAP,

05:17.360 --> 05:24.160
not TNO, as this graphic beautifully highlights unknown unknowns.

05:24.160 --> 05:28.640
Let me read here what the actual legislation says, so we know specifically what they

05:28.640 --> 05:36.160
intended with Schumer. UAP is any object operating or judge capable of operating in outer space,

05:36.160 --> 05:41.200
the atmosphere, ocean surface, or undersea, lacking prosaic attribution,

05:41.200 --> 05:48.560
due to performance characteristics and properties not previously known to be achievable

05:48.560 --> 05:54.320
based upon commonly understood principles of physics. There's a massive difference between UAP

05:54.320 --> 05:59.920
and TNO. And there's a huge distinction between these, and Schumer makes this explicit.

06:00.800 --> 06:08.080
So TNO is a class of objects that temporarily resist prosaic attribution by the initial observer

06:08.080 --> 06:13.440
due to performance or due to environmental or system limitations associated with the

06:13.440 --> 06:19.840
observation process, but that nevertheless have a known accepted human origin.

06:20.560 --> 06:25.120
So TNO is the stuff that you mistake at the time of observation, but you later figure out

06:25.120 --> 06:29.840
like what it is. So if you look at Blue Book, you know, depending on the statistics you want to use,

06:29.840 --> 06:36.720
the 94% or the 80% of what they spent their time on was TNO, was all explainable. The residuals.

06:37.200 --> 06:42.640
To continue touching on the legislation here, NEL references a slide on the NDAA's Executive

06:42.640 --> 06:48.640
Summary. The key takeaway here is utilizing the National Archives to archive all UAP data.

06:49.520 --> 06:54.240
NEL states what we are all thinking. Nobody necessarily trusts that's going to happen,

06:54.240 --> 07:00.320
and I think. Therefore, the review board will provide oversight. Unlike the 1992 JFK Records

07:00.320 --> 07:07.280
oversight, here NEL references the issue of materials, biological evidence of NHI and technology

07:07.280 --> 07:13.120
of unknown origins. Thus, the Schumer Amendment allows for eminent domain of these materials.

07:13.680 --> 07:20.960
Colonel NEL explains the terms NHI, legacy programs, prosaic attribution, and TuO that appear

07:20.960 --> 07:27.200
specifically in the Schumer Amendment. He makes it apparent that the NDAA was searching specifically

07:27.280 --> 07:31.920
for anything that is non-human related. These are terms of reference in the legislation. So

07:31.920 --> 07:37.440
non-human intelligence, at least 18 times cited in there, any sentient intelligent non-human life

07:37.440 --> 07:43.440
form, regardless of nature or ultimate origin that may be presumed responsible for UAP based on

07:43.440 --> 07:49.600
the earlier definition, or of which the federal government has become aware. Legacy program,

07:49.600 --> 07:53.680
all federal, state, local government, commercial industry, academic, private sector endeavors to

07:53.680 --> 07:59.440
collect, exploit, versus engineer, TuO, or biological evidence of NHI. Prosaic attribution,

07:59.440 --> 08:05.040
you remember this was in both of those terms, UAP and TNO. Prosaic attribution, having a human,

08:05.040 --> 08:13.520
either foreign or domestic origin. So UAP is non-human, TNO human. Technology of unknown origin,

08:13.520 --> 08:18.640
this is very important for the eminent domain clause. Any material or metamaterial, ejecta,

08:18.640 --> 08:23.520
crash debris, mechanisms, machinery, equipment, assemblies, or sub-assemblies, engineering models

08:23.520 --> 08:29.200
or processes, damage or intact aerospace vehicles, or damage or intact ocean surface or undersea

08:29.200 --> 08:37.520
crap associated with UAP, or incorporating science and technology lacking prosaic attribution or known

08:37.520 --> 08:42.480
means of human manufacture. The kernel then goes on to highlight arguments for and against

08:42.480 --> 08:48.080
eminent domain of all UAP record and materials. And for those of you who don't know, eminent domain

08:48.080 --> 08:52.880
is essentially the federal government's ability to take whatever they want, whenever they want.

08:53.680 --> 08:58.000
What is interesting here is that some of the cons infringe on property ownership.

08:58.560 --> 09:04.400
Here Nell is specifically referring to private corporations in possession of UAP and UAP material.

09:05.520 --> 09:09.280
Nell moves on to make the key distinction between control disclosure

09:09.280 --> 09:15.920
and catastrophic disclosure. This difference being control disclosure uses a campaigned plan,

09:15.920 --> 09:21.200
and catastrophic disclosure is essentially the opening of the floodgates. All information

09:21.200 --> 09:28.160
dumped out there by possibly an adversary or NHI themselves to create social disruption or other

09:28.160 --> 09:34.800
means. Unfortunately the Schumer Rounds amendment was watered down and gutted by adversaries to

09:34.800 --> 09:40.080
pro-disclosure. Hopefully this bill in its entirety will be released in the near future,

09:40.080 --> 09:48.960
maybe the 2025 NDAA. Here Nell states reasons for and against non-disclosure. This is an extremely

09:48.960 --> 09:55.040
intriguing slide and logically all six reasons make sense. National security implications,

09:55.040 --> 10:00.720
lack of a credible plan, social disruption, covert agreements cover for misdeeds,

10:00.720 --> 10:05.120
and organizational intrusion slash distraction from priorities.

10:05.840 --> 10:12.240
We know from Grush an almost cold war has been conducted to keep knowledge of UAP from adversaries,

10:12.240 --> 10:17.360
specifically China and Russia, addressing the national security risks posted here.

10:18.080 --> 10:23.680
I am really interested in the new physics slash technologies that have unprecedented

10:23.680 --> 10:29.840
ramifications for all human society. And look at the covert agreement section,

10:29.840 --> 10:38.960
NHI quid pro quo. Is it possible and true that the USG has made deals or agreements with NHI,

10:38.960 --> 10:43.600
as some people have suggested? And the cover for misdeeds, this is also addressed by Grush.

10:44.160 --> 10:48.000
Part of the reason for the cover up is in fact feudalistic dominance,

10:48.000 --> 10:52.160
and numerous crimes including murder have been conducted to keep these secrets.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.960
But now take a look at the cons or essentially pro-disclosure agreements.

10:57.760 --> 11:03.840
Under prevent loss of technological dominance here, look at, some evidence suggests the USA

11:03.840 --> 11:10.880
may be losing a UAP arms race. If this is true and Russia or China are near breakthroughs of

11:10.880 --> 11:18.720
harnessing NHI, this has global power shift levels of implications. As Nell states, all of these

11:18.720 --> 11:24.640
issues are better solved in an academic sector and are largely not government issues besides

11:24.640 --> 11:30.560
the cold war and arms race. And now we arrive to Nell's famous slide which partially leaked back

11:30.560 --> 11:38.880
in November 2023 titled, Way Forward UAP Campaign Plan Lines of Effort. This slide is

11:38.880 --> 11:44.640
absurdly perplexing so let's break it down. To reach a post-disclosure world with proper

11:44.640 --> 11:50.560
oversight restored, catastrophic disclosure avoided, and scientific understanding advanced?

11:51.360 --> 11:57.840
Nell envisions a campaign with five major phases through four major channels, the public sector,

11:57.840 --> 12:01.840
philosophical investigation, scientific research, and the private sector.

12:02.800 --> 12:09.040
Phase zero consists of shaping the narrative around UAP which was done successfully by ATIP,

12:09.040 --> 12:16.080
DOD videos, the 2017 New York Times article, and UAP Task Force. Notice guys how Arrow is not listed

12:16.080 --> 12:21.600
here, I'm sure Sean Kirkpatrick is seething. Phase one, which has a targeted end date of

12:21.600 --> 12:28.480
January 1st 2024 seems all but complete, ending with the Schumer legislation. Government acceptance

12:28.480 --> 12:36.160
has been achieved, UAP is now largely a bipartisan issue, and reactive hypothesis generation is popping

12:36.160 --> 12:42.160
up such as the newly published paper claiming that some UAP are plasma-based pre-life.

12:43.040 --> 12:50.160
Phase two aims to correlate signatures by January 1st 2026, garnering a more stringent approach

12:50.160 --> 12:53.360
and harnessing of academia like the Soul Foundation is doing.

12:54.080 --> 12:59.520
Likely due to the stigma persisting around serious academic research, this phase is still at risk.

13:00.480 --> 13:07.040
Phase three plans to be completed by October 1st 2030 and is seen as an inflection point by Nell,

13:07.040 --> 13:12.800
possibly serving as the disclosure point for humanity. This phase seeks public acceptance,

13:12.800 --> 13:19.680
which is a tall ask if you ask me. Phase four to be completed by the 1st of October 2034

13:19.680 --> 13:27.040
aims to fully answer the five W's, who, what, when, where, and why. This phase is off-target,

13:27.040 --> 13:32.560
and finally phase five has an indefinite timeline, looking for an interactive approach with UAP in

13:32.560 --> 13:40.960
a strategic end state, possibly meaning integrating NHI and NHI technology with our earth and civilization.

13:41.920 --> 13:46.320
Nell has a couple ideas for each of the four channels and how they can lead to a post-disclosure

13:46.320 --> 13:51.040
world. So this is the government line of effort. Pass Schumer, grant legal amnesty,

13:51.040 --> 13:56.000
centralized the data, create a Manhattan project to address this area, sponsor National Science

13:56.000 --> 14:01.440
Foundation grants, charter an NIE, National Intel Estimate to assess the public-private

14:01.440 --> 14:06.480
positions of every country with this topic and where they are with it, and use that to tee up

14:06.480 --> 14:14.160
a United Nations summit or World Congress on developing new norms of behavior in this context.

14:14.160 --> 14:19.120
I think we need a sociological model for analyzing the societal impact for disclosure

14:19.120 --> 14:24.240
and then developing mitigation strategies a priori to address that. Now, some people think

14:24.240 --> 14:28.480
that maybe less of a concern or more of a concern is kind of irrelevant, like it's an unknown right

14:28.480 --> 14:35.120
now, but we need a plan to address it to lower that concern. Codify the laws of ethics in an

14:35.120 --> 14:39.680
environment where we might have a hierarchy of being, where everyone isn't necessarily

14:39.680 --> 14:43.920
having equal competitive potential. How do you, it's essentially translating

14:43.920 --> 14:48.800
our special relativity version of ethics to a general relativity version of ethics,

14:48.800 --> 14:55.200
where you've got the problem of a more advanced civilization coming in and disrupting a less

14:55.200 --> 15:00.480
advanced civilization, developing theoretical as well as practical methods to analyze metamaterials.

15:00.480 --> 15:06.080
And let's get to the point where we can actually talk about utilizing the, what is it, 339 isotopes

15:06.080 --> 15:11.360
and engineering materials out of that instead of the 118 elements that were been sort of limited

15:11.360 --> 15:16.000
to. We need to work in the business utility of forming consortiums to actually look at this

15:16.000 --> 15:20.400
material if the government was actually going to make it available. Codify presence and legal

15:20.400 --> 15:27.120
standards for determining intellectual property rights over the material, analyzing economic

15:27.120 --> 15:32.000
incentives and the impact to the economy if new energy sources were developed.

15:32.640 --> 15:39.040
Nell's presentation is poignant and powerful with astounding implications, but we can go a

15:39.040 --> 15:45.840
little deeper here. Now let's visit two backup slides not shown on Nell's presentation as provided

15:45.840 --> 15:52.640
by Matthew Pines. The first of these slides looks to replace the Kardashev Scale. I talked about

15:52.640 --> 15:57.920
this in part two of my iceberg, but essentially the Kardashev Scale benchmarks the technological

15:57.920 --> 16:04.160
capabilities of a civilization and places them into three types. A planetary civilization that

16:04.160 --> 16:09.760
is able to harness all the energy from their home planet, a stellar civilization which is able to

16:09.760 --> 16:16.080
harness all of the energy from its host star, and a galactic civilization which is able to

16:16.080 --> 16:23.280
harness the complete energy output of its home galaxy. We are currently in estimated 0.72 on

16:23.280 --> 16:31.200
the Kardashev Scale. Look at this line. Since it is not implausible, given the diversity of UAP

16:31.200 --> 16:37.920
sightings, that numerous civilizations may be interacting concurrently. That is just such

16:37.920 --> 16:44.720
an intriguing thought, but this new scale looks to develop a universal civilization development

16:44.720 --> 16:52.320
datum to try and forecast NHI motives based on attributes. Instead of just a sliding scale,

16:52.320 --> 16:58.400
this is a new multivariable system in which what they are, what they know, and who they are,

16:58.400 --> 17:04.000
are gauged and plotted. The end states for these civilizations are quite astounding.

17:04.640 --> 17:11.600
Spacetime manipulation, understanding reality, and immortality slash physical transcendence

17:11.600 --> 17:18.160
are the three kind of variable reference points of these civilizations. I am honestly

17:18.160 --> 17:24.320
blown away by this slide, the proposed taxonomy of UAP and origin hypothesis,

17:24.320 --> 17:30.320
and struggle to know where to even start. UAP, hypothesis, and NHI are broken up here into

17:30.320 --> 17:38.000
three main categories, physical, psychophysical, and metaphysical. Within the physical are origins

17:38.000 --> 17:46.000
that span from expected to downright bizarre. We have, of course, our natural phenomena, humans,

17:46.000 --> 17:52.080
inner galactic, ETs, and even proto-humans, but then we also have stranded gods,

17:52.960 --> 17:58.640
unknown regions of spacetime, disconnected hyperspace, the 3D avatars, or holograms,

17:58.640 --> 18:04.400
as Grush once mentioned with the holographic universe. Within physical we even get weirder,

18:04.400 --> 18:09.040
with colliding universes, parallel universes, macro quantum fluctuations,

18:09.120 --> 18:14.800
pan-galactic entanglement, and distance recursion. And now we get the medical physical,

18:14.800 --> 18:22.320
in which supernatural forces, incorporeal life forms, ascended masters, angelic or demonic

18:22.320 --> 18:28.400
beings, artificial realities, and more are mentioned. This is wild stuff, and actually,

18:28.400 --> 18:33.120
thinking of some fun, please let me know if you would like me to do a tier list on these proposed

18:33.120 --> 18:37.120
taxonomies. Just my personal opinion on all these topics, but of course that could be an

18:37.120 --> 18:44.000
absolute blast because I'll tell you right now, I identify more with the physical range of explanations

18:44.000 --> 18:47.840
and not just the, you know, pretty standard stuff, but I'd like to get into that.

18:48.880 --> 18:55.120
Things with Nell couldn't get any weirder, right? But what if I told you he was one of the 40 first

18:55.120 --> 19:00.000
hand witness whistleblowers that Grush interviewed? Check out this Leslie Cain clip.

19:08.000 --> 19:18.240
David Grush said in his testimony that he talked to 40 people over four years,

19:18.240 --> 19:23.840
all of whom had information on a secret military program that has non-human craft and remains.

19:23.840 --> 19:27.760
Is it surprising to you that none of those 40 people has spoken out?

19:29.760 --> 19:35.120
It is, it actually isn't Elizabeth. I mean, as some of them have, one of them actually

19:35.120 --> 19:41.680
was in our article in the debrief, a former Army colonel named Carl Nell. I think maybe some of

19:41.680 --> 19:46.400
them have spoken out a little bit and we just don't maybe put it all together, but it really

19:46.400 --> 19:51.760
isn't surprising because of the repercussions that people face. And Dave Grush is an example of that.

19:51.760 --> 19:56.160
He talked a little bit of in the hearing yesterday about the repercussions that he's faced, which

19:56.160 --> 20:02.640
are very harmful to him, both personally and professionally for speaking out. So I think others

20:02.640 --> 20:06.880
have the same concerns and they've seen it happen to him. They want to wait and make sure it's safe

20:06.880 --> 20:11.520
for them to come forward and not have to face the same kinds of things that David Grush faced.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.560
Yeah, can you elaborate on that? And he just said he had some.

20:14.560 --> 20:19.680
I'd like to thank Twitter Ace UAP News at highpeak77 for making a thread on this.

20:20.240 --> 20:25.120
In Colonel Nells LinkedIn bio, he served as the technical intelligence operations officer for the

20:25.120 --> 20:31.200
DIA. Here states, quote, first person deployed from the DIA directorate of intelligence production

20:31.280 --> 20:37.360
and analysis to participate in multi-agency planning for Operation Iraqi Freedom as the

20:37.360 --> 20:44.640
foreign materials program command representative to U.S. CENTCOM slash CFLCC in Kuwait.

20:45.440 --> 20:51.520
Served as the C slash J2 for the one star combined joint captured material exploitation

20:51.520 --> 20:56.880
center in Iraq. And as we know from Schellenberger's article, dozens of government whistleblowers

20:56.960 --> 21:02.720
have given testimony to Congress Pentagon and Inspector General says sources that there have

21:02.720 --> 21:10.000
been ongoing crash retrieval programs of both foreign vehicles and UAP. Could Nells role in

21:10.000 --> 21:17.120
this Iraq mission? Seeing him encounter a downed UAP leading to his first hand witness testimony,

21:17.120 --> 21:22.480
I got a lot more to dive into here. So stay tuned. But thank you again, UAP News for that Twitter

21:22.480 --> 21:29.600
thread. Hey guys, I know this video turned out almost as long as Colonel Nells talk itself.

21:30.160 --> 21:34.800
But still, I thought it important to try and break down everything that he said in this

21:34.800 --> 21:38.800
soul symposium. I hope you guys enjoyed this breakdown. There's a lot of other interesting

21:38.800 --> 21:44.640
talks from this soul foundation event I want to go through, including grushes, Chris Melons,

21:44.640 --> 21:50.480
Kevin Knuths, Gary Nolan, Jacques Valais as well. So if you guys like this, stay tuned for that.

21:50.480 --> 21:57.600
I had a lot of fun making this. I hope you don't mind the not kind of reaction style. I wanted to

21:57.600 --> 22:01.520
watch this and make sure I had all my thoughts first before I reported information to everybody,

22:01.520 --> 22:07.600
not do kind of a not much effort, watch through together. So I hope you enjoyed it just a quick

22:07.600 --> 22:14.080
video today. Please remember to like and subscribe and I will catch you guys on the next video. Thank you.
