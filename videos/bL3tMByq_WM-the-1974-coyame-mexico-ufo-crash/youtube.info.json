    "description": "A deep dive into a fascinating UFO crash retrieval case alleged to have occurred in Coyame, Chihuahua, Mexico in 1974 referred to by some researchers as \"Mexico's Roswell\".\n\nUFO researchers such as Leanard Stringfield began hearing whispers of a collision between a civilian light aircraft and a disk-shaped craft in the late 1970s-1980s involving a covert US Recovery team and a Mexican Military Retrieval team who were tragically killed during recovery. It wasn't until 1992 a document titled \"Research Findings on Chihuaha Disk Crash\" would mysteriously appear on internet message boards and in the mailboxes of UFO researchers. This document meant for the \"Deneb\" team describes the Coyame event in shocking detail, giving disturbing insights into the interworkings of US UFO Recovery teams.\n\nAlthough this case has been covered by Leanord Stringfield, Ryan S.
