00:00.000 --> 00:05.880
Meet Battelle Memorial Institute, a private non-profit applied sciences and technology

00:05.880 --> 00:11.600
development company whose mission is to, quote, deliver scientific discovery and applied

00:11.600 --> 00:15.160
research that makes the world a better place to live.

00:15.160 --> 00:20.560
This private non-profit has a prolific list of USG-contracted work, including classified

00:20.560 --> 00:21.560
SAPs.

00:21.560 --> 00:26.920
Battelle has a storied history in the technological development of our US society, including research

00:26.920 --> 00:32.480
into the fabrication of uranium for the Manhattan Project from 39 to 52, development of the

00:32.480 --> 00:38.600
photocopy machine and UPC barcode system, work on combustion, electronics, energy, conversion,

00:38.600 --> 00:44.640
propellants, all for Apollo 11, and military research into biological and chemical weapons

00:44.640 --> 00:47.040
slash defense systems and more.

00:47.040 --> 00:52.880
Today, Battelle manages the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center at Los

00:52.880 --> 00:58.320
Alamos National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL, as well

00:58.320 --> 01:03.720
as Oak Ridge National Lab, all of which are DOE-sponsored labs.

01:03.720 --> 01:08.200
So we already see some ties here with Battelle and the USG UAP work in Los Alamos and the

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
DOE.

01:09.200 --> 01:14.240
But what if I told you, Battelle is harboring a dark secret, that the company has a long

01:14.240 --> 01:21.800
history of studying UFOs, aiding the USG and USAF in the UFO cover-up, and has even conducted

01:21.800 --> 01:24.640
analysis on UFO material.

01:24.640 --> 01:29.840
Hey guys, it is UAP Gerb and we are finally going to start to dive into one of the most

01:29.840 --> 01:34.960
fascinating aspects of the UFO phenomena, the private sector's connection to the study

01:34.960 --> 01:35.960
of UFOs.

01:35.960 --> 01:41.200
Numerous key figures such as David Grush, Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon, Eric Davis, former

01:41.200 --> 01:46.960
Senator Harry Reid, and more have made direct statements that USG defense contractors have

01:46.960 --> 01:52.200
a direct hand in the reverse engineering and crash retrieval of UAP.

01:52.200 --> 01:58.640
So today we are going to dive into one such company with real dirty hands on work of UFO

01:58.640 --> 02:03.560
material and research, the Battelle Memorial Institute.

02:03.560 --> 02:09.720
The earliest tracing of Battelle and UFOs goes to something called Project Stork.

02:09.720 --> 02:16.000
In 1952, the director of the Central Intelligence received a memorandum titled Flying Saucers,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.880
which detailed an arrangement between ATIC, the Air Force Technology Intelligence Committee,

02:20.880 --> 02:26.120
and Battelle Memorial Institute for the contractor to establish a machine indexing system for

02:26.120 --> 02:29.000
official reports of UFO sightings.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.080
On the 9th of January, 1953, Battelle's Dr. Howard C. Cross proposes that the ongoing

02:36.080 --> 02:41.160
Project Stork, quote, assists the Air Force in reassuring the public that everything

02:41.160 --> 02:45.800
is well under control with respect to the UFO problem.

02:45.800 --> 02:50.400
At the time, this memo was classified secret and even calls to attention Captain Edward

02:50.400 --> 02:55.040
J. Ruppelt, the project's sign, grudge, and bluebook director.

02:55.040 --> 02:59.600
I've talked about him in the history of the stigma, so check that video out if you haven't.

02:59.600 --> 03:04.960
If you'll remember from that same video, in 1953, the Robertson Panel was conducted

03:04.960 --> 03:12.440
to ensure that all national security agencies should strip UFOs of, quote, special status

03:12.440 --> 03:16.240
and suggest the public there is no legitimate evidence of their existence.

03:16.240 --> 03:21.080
While the Robertson Panel was conducted, Battelle had been commissioned around the same time

03:21.080 --> 03:27.000
to separately analyze all Air Force UFO cases away from bluebook or these official panels

03:27.000 --> 03:28.880
under codename STORK.

03:28.880 --> 03:32.920
This project paralleled to bluebook and was even mentioned by J. Allen Heineck during

03:32.920 --> 03:36.480
his attempted testimony at the Robertson Panel.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.800
Thanks to the efforts of SUFON, the computer UFO network, I have been able to find all

03:40.800 --> 03:43.800
seven Project STORK status reports.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.440
That is another analysis for another day, however, all parts of course will be provided

03:47.440 --> 03:49.560
in the video description.

03:49.560 --> 03:56.720
On the 5th of May, 1955, Battelle and ATIC published a comprehensive analysis of 3,200

03:56.720 --> 03:59.880
UFO sightings titled Special Report 14.

03:59.880 --> 04:05.320
This report concluded that UFO are not aerial aircraft beyond human scientific knowledge

04:05.320 --> 04:10.200
because no physical matter had ever been recorded from any UFO sighting.

04:10.240 --> 04:15.480
But if we dig deeper, there is a massive contradiction here from Battelle's claim that no physical

04:15.480 --> 04:17.480
matter had ever been recovered.

04:17.480 --> 04:23.280
Six years earlier in 1949, Battelle had been contracted by none other than Wright-Patterson

04:23.280 --> 04:27.600
Air Force Base to perform analysis on shape memory alloys.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.280
See on screen now and in the video notes the first and second progress report covering the

04:32.280 --> 04:39.760
period of September 1st to October 21st, 1949 on research and development of titanium alloys.

04:40.480 --> 04:49.880
The bulk of these investigations focus on Nitinol, a nickel-titanium alloy, a metal

04:49.880 --> 04:56.800
that would not be officially discovered until 1961 by Dr. William J. Bueller.

04:56.800 --> 05:02.920
So Battelle was performing analysis on the nickel-titanium shape metal alloy, now known

05:02.920 --> 05:07.360
as Nitinol, over 10 years prior to its official discovery?

05:07.360 --> 05:10.320
Well what exactly is Nitinol?

05:10.320 --> 05:14.480
For you material scientists out there and I am not one of you, Nitinol has the unique

05:14.480 --> 05:18.200
properties of super-elasticity and shape memory.

05:18.200 --> 05:22.600
The metal can be subjected to high levels of stress and snap back to its original shape

05:22.600 --> 05:27.080
when pressure is released, showing no deformation on the material.

05:27.080 --> 05:32.440
Nitinol is also elastochloric where the material heats up when exposed to a mechanical force

05:32.440 --> 05:33.440
field.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.600
When this heat is released into the environment and the force field is removed, the material

05:37.600 --> 05:42.240
super cools and extracts the same amount of heat from the environment again.

05:42.240 --> 05:47.560
If I am not stressing this enough, Nitinol is a remarkable material that is exceedingly

05:47.560 --> 05:54.440
difficult to manufacture due to the exceptionally high and tight compositional control required

05:54.440 --> 05:57.340
and the tremendous reactivity of titanium.

05:57.340 --> 06:03.360
The material is even used for thermal and electrical actuators, implants due to the

06:03.360 --> 06:07.480
material's biocompatibility and structural dampening.

06:07.480 --> 06:13.020
So again, Battelle was contracted to perform a material analysis on an alloy that is exceedingly

06:13.020 --> 06:20.000
difficult to make, requiring vacuum arc remelting or vacuum induction remelting to manufacture

06:20.000 --> 06:27.500
today in the 21st century, but had this material in the late 40s specifically 1949?

06:27.500 --> 06:32.880
And does this alloy not sound almost exactly like the material that was discovered in the

06:32.880 --> 06:40.720
1947 Roswell crash, that Jesse Marcell described as an exceedingly light metal that would retain

06:40.720 --> 06:42.720
its shape after deformation?

06:42.720 --> 06:47.480
And remember, Jesse Marcell was a military officer who was taken to the UFO crash debris

06:47.480 --> 06:52.360
field with rancher Mac Brazel, who discovered these materials and then was later told by

06:52.360 --> 06:58.780
General Rami to pose with balsa wood and aluminum foil to push the weather balloon theory and

06:58.780 --> 07:01.380
all of this is in Marcell's own words.

07:01.380 --> 07:06.780
More damming is that this debris from a UFO was supposedly shipped to none other than,

07:06.780 --> 07:09.460
you guessed it, Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

07:09.460 --> 07:16.100
So to summarize, I am directly inferring that the 1947 Roswell crash led to the discovery

07:16.100 --> 07:22.080
of the material known as Nitinol and thus Wright Patterson Air Force Base and the US

07:22.080 --> 07:29.500
Air Force contracted Battel to perform a material analysis on Nitinol in 1949 over 10 years

07:29.500 --> 07:33.780
before its quote unquote official discovery in the private sector.

07:33.780 --> 07:38.860
But this wouldn't be a UAP Grr video without the mention of the Atomic Energy Commission,

07:38.860 --> 07:39.860
would it not?

07:39.860 --> 07:45.020
Well this study by Battel into titanium base alloys was a research and development project

07:45.020 --> 07:47.860
under the Atomic Energy Commission.

07:47.860 --> 07:52.340
For those of you who have never watched one of my videos, UFO records and materials have

07:52.340 --> 07:59.540
been classically misclassified under the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement under Trans-classified

07:59.540 --> 08:01.520
Nuclear Foreign Material.

08:01.520 --> 08:06.500
With this report, Battel's work on titanium alloys is one of very few studies without

08:06.500 --> 08:07.500
classification.

08:07.500 --> 08:12.660
It's not labeled as classified, unclassified, or declassified, but rather is labeled as

08:12.660 --> 08:13.660
restricted.

08:13.660 --> 08:19.700
Essentially, this is a private sector classification standard in which only need to know read-in

08:19.700 --> 08:21.800
access is solely allowed.

08:21.800 --> 08:26.020
If you've never heard of this before, people like David Grush have spoken that part of

08:26.020 --> 08:30.620
the reason that private industries are used for UFO studies is because they have their

08:30.620 --> 08:35.380
own legal classification standards that can't be breached by people with SAP access like

08:35.380 --> 08:36.380
Grush himself.

08:36.380 --> 08:43.440
But even more perplexing, these studies into Nitinol were not declassified until 2010,

08:43.440 --> 08:49.760
but we can go deeper because I have the most bizarre connection to make with Battel and

08:49.760 --> 08:52.640
this Nitinol UFO material.

08:52.640 --> 08:58.880
Within Battel Report 2, we observe an inconspicuous subsection titled, quote, Analytical Methods

08:58.880 --> 09:07.040
for Titanium-Based Alloys by Juan A.C. Eckert and E.J. Center, a senior research chemical

09:07.040 --> 09:12.480
engineer who worked for Battel from 1939 to 1957.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.640
Looking out of the ordinary, right?

09:14.640 --> 09:18.240
Center's section of the report deals with titanium purity.

09:18.240 --> 09:23.520
Exceptionally pure titanium is needed to make Nitinol memory metal due to the high reactivity

09:23.520 --> 09:25.840
as titanium, as I mentioned above.

09:25.840 --> 09:31.880
So keep E.J. Center's name in mind, because let's travel to the summer of 1994 and read

09:31.880 --> 09:39.000
into the Ohio UFO notebook by Dr. Irene Scott and the MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network Board

09:39.000 --> 09:40.600
of Directors.

09:40.600 --> 09:47.720
This piece titled, quote, The Ohio UFO Crash Connection and Other Stories, details an informant

09:47.720 --> 09:51.040
who came to MUFON in 1992.

09:51.040 --> 09:56.440
This man attended North High School in Columbus, Ohio in the late 1950s.

09:56.440 --> 10:00.980
In 1958, he dated a girl named Kathy Center.

10:00.980 --> 10:07.700
One night while visiting her home, her father, one Elroy John Center, told them while working

10:07.700 --> 10:14.400
at Battel, and remember he left in 1957, he was, quote, responsible for a project which

10:14.400 --> 10:19.440
required him to study parts retrieved from a flying saucer.

10:19.440 --> 10:25.880
This section of E.J. Center is under one decoding the I-beam of the MUFON report.

10:25.880 --> 10:31.580
Roswell enthusiasts will know that Major Jesse Marcell, who was taken by Rancher Mack Braswell

10:31.580 --> 10:38.320
to the debris field, found an I-beam amongst the wreckage and memory metal, which had strange

10:38.320 --> 10:41.440
characters on it resembling hieroglyphs.

10:41.440 --> 10:46.160
What's crucial to remember here, guys, is that although MUFON reports on E.J. Center

10:46.160 --> 10:53.360
and his work on flying saucers for Battel in 1994, E.J. Center's 1949 work on Knittenall

10:53.360 --> 10:57.320
was not declassified until 2010.

10:57.320 --> 11:02.420
So making this connection unless E.J. Center was really, in fact, working on materials

11:02.420 --> 11:07.260
from a crashed disc for Battel, likely the Roswell wreckage, and blabbed about it once

11:07.260 --> 11:11.180
he left Battel in 1958, would be impossible.

11:11.180 --> 11:17.260
To put the cherry on top here, you JRE fans will remember famed computer scientist and

11:17.260 --> 11:23.820
ufologist Jacques Vallée, appearing on JRE, the Joe Rogan podcast, on the 4th of December

11:23.820 --> 11:27.960
2020, with the Phenomenon director James Fox.

11:27.960 --> 11:32.120
If you haven't seen the Phenomenon by Fox, I highly recommend checking this out, as well

11:32.120 --> 11:35.880
as Moment of Contact, which is about the Varginia Brazil UFO case.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.880
He's got great documentaries, but anyways.

11:38.880 --> 11:43.520
Jacques is famous for spending many years connecting the private sector to official

11:43.520 --> 11:50.240
USG investigation, and within this podcast, he references one of the entities that helps

11:50.240 --> 11:55.460
control the UFO phenomena, and the study of it in intelligence agencies is, quote,

11:55.460 --> 11:57.460
a private contractor.

11:57.460 --> 12:04.260
But Vallée nervously states he does not wish to disclose who, in fact, has UFO materials.

12:04.260 --> 12:09.780
Fox comes to all of our rescue to suggest the name of the group indirectly by stating

12:09.780 --> 12:14.700
its involvement with the 1953 Robertson panel.

12:14.700 --> 12:19.340
As we studied above, this is Battel Memorial Institute.

12:19.340 --> 12:25.040
I honestly don't know if I'm able to use JRE clips from Spotify for copyright inclusion,

12:25.040 --> 12:26.840
so I'm not going to do that here.

12:26.840 --> 12:32.760
But if you wish to check this out, this is JRE, episode 1574, and begin at about an hour

12:32.760 --> 12:40.040
and 42 minutes in, where Jacques starts talking about pieces of metal recovered from UFOs.

12:40.040 --> 12:44.440
And this is where the discussion about what private industry has these materials and where

12:44.440 --> 12:48.120
Battel is suggested by Fox and Vallée himself.

12:48.120 --> 12:55.380
And lastly, Battel actually has shocking connections to Arrow and Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, our modern-day

12:55.380 --> 12:57.300
disinformation agent.

12:57.300 --> 13:03.140
Kirkpatrick and Arrow were directed to report to one Ronald Moultrie, the Undersecretary

13:03.140 --> 13:10.300
of Defense for Intelligence and Security, and almost definitely one of the hostile witnesses

13:10.300 --> 13:12.180
on David Grush's list.

13:12.180 --> 13:18.000
If you'll remember from my Sean Kirkpatrick and Arrow video in 2022, Arrow and the DoD

13:18.000 --> 13:24.880
awarded a company called Sandcorp, a contract of $1.9 million for Arrow support services.

13:24.880 --> 13:29.480
This Sandcorp specializes in preventing leaks and stopping whistleblowers, okay, and guess

13:29.480 --> 13:31.560
who oversaw this contract?

13:31.560 --> 13:37.200
The Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security won Ronald Moultrie.

13:37.200 --> 13:43.180
Additionally, on the 16th December 2022, Ronald Moultrie and Sean Kirkpatrick actually held

13:43.180 --> 13:48.820
a public press conference that they have not seen evidence of crashed UFOs that suggest

13:48.820 --> 13:51.620
they are craft from another planet or dimension.

13:51.620 --> 13:55.060
They additionally suggest there have been no crash recoveries.

13:55.060 --> 14:01.460
So here, alongside Kirkpatrick, we see that Ronald Moultrie is vested and interested in

14:01.460 --> 14:05.220
playing down UAP and stopping whistleblowers, right?

14:05.400 --> 14:11.440
Well, the honorable Ronald Moultrie is actually a board member of Battelle, and has been since

14:11.440 --> 14:18.400
2016, and worse yet, Moultrie has tried to scrub this from his record, including taking

14:18.400 --> 14:21.800
down his board membership from his LinkedIn page.

14:21.800 --> 14:27.120
But fortunately, Pogo.com stated on its website that Moultrie had been an advisory board

14:27.120 --> 14:31.760
member at Battelle, and fortunately grabbed screenshots before Moultrie took this down

14:31.760 --> 14:33.640
as I'm showing on screen right now.

14:33.640 --> 14:40.100
So even up to the modern day, Battelle has its hooks, sank in the USG, and is controlling

14:40.100 --> 14:42.740
the UAP narrative.

14:42.740 --> 14:49.900
So, Battelle, not only have they played their hand in investigating UFOs for the USG and

14:49.900 --> 14:55.660
Air Force, but they've also aided in quelling public interest in UFOs by saying there's

14:55.660 --> 15:02.460
nothing to them, and studying UFO material, such as Nitinol, which was likely recovered

15:02.480 --> 15:04.080
from the Roswell crash.

15:04.080 --> 15:11.200
Guys, if I can't stress this enough, the story of the EJ Center, in 1949, he worked

15:11.200 --> 15:16.680
for Battelle, studying the Nickel Titanium alloys, and this was not declassified until

15:16.680 --> 15:23.920
2010, but in 1994, the Ohio Muffin General reported on EJ Center, who said he worked

15:23.920 --> 15:28.040
on parts of a flying saucer once he left Battelle in 58.

15:28.040 --> 15:32.820
That connection is just obscene, and really adds another kernel of credibility to this

15:32.820 --> 15:37.060
already baffling case with a ton of supporting evidence.

15:37.060 --> 15:40.020
I hope you guys enjoyed this look into Battelle.

15:40.020 --> 15:44.860
Battelle's hands are insanely dirty in UFOs.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.860
So is Lockheed Martin, so is the Carlisle Group.

15:46.860 --> 15:50.980
I will make videos about those as well, but I hope everybody learned something today.

15:50.980 --> 15:55.380
For the people in the know, and I know I have a lot of fans who probably know a lot more

15:55.400 --> 16:02.600
than I do in some aspects of UAP, there was a leaker online about eight months ago in

16:02.600 --> 16:10.600
2023, I believe, who claimed he was a biologist at Battelle, working on EBOs, extraterrestrial

16:10.600 --> 16:12.520
biological organisms, if I think it is.

16:12.520 --> 16:17.680
He goes into the whole taxonomy of supposed aliens found and retrieved, crashed, and dead.

16:17.680 --> 16:21.600
I decided not to include that just because, of course, there is a possibility that is

16:21.620 --> 16:26.140
a LARP, and I don't have supporting evidence right now for those claims.

16:26.140 --> 16:27.980
They are quite insane.

16:27.980 --> 16:32.820
Maybe I'll do a video on that in the future too, but I know some of you guys are probably

16:32.820 --> 16:35.780
thinking why didn't he include that, why didn't he talk about that.

16:35.780 --> 16:40.460
But that's why, just because I can't put together a body of evidence and make a well-researched

16:40.460 --> 16:43.660
thesis for that, quote unquote, whistleblower.

16:43.660 --> 16:47.620
So maybe another time, give me 100 hours to look into that.

16:47.620 --> 16:49.620
But I hope you guys are having a great week.

16:49.620 --> 16:50.620
I am sure not.

16:50.640 --> 16:54.600
I'm sorry if I'm disheveled, I'm a huge UFC fan, and last night I had to watch my favorite

16:54.600 --> 16:58.200
fighter in the world, Alexander Volkanovsky, get knocked out.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.400
So I'm a little under the weather, so your guys' support means the most.

17:01.400 --> 17:05.000
Please remember to like and subscribe, and I will catch you guys on the next video.

17:05.000 --> 17:05.500
Thank you.
