00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
On May 14th, 2008, a perplexing and enigmatic 20-second clip supposedly depicting a disc-shaped

00:08.320 --> 00:14.220
UFO moving alongside a jet appeared out of the blue on YouTube.

00:14.220 --> 00:19.540
This video was uploaded by a long-dead channel titled Danny Lampkin.

00:19.540 --> 00:25.020
In the video description, Lampkin says one simple sentence, quote, I'm not too sure

00:25.020 --> 00:31.020
about this one, but I thought I would download it anyway, for you to decide.

00:31.020 --> 00:54.820
Okay, I can probably guess what you're thinking right now.

00:54.820 --> 00:58.640
This video is far too fantastic to be true.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.220
The quality is garbage.

01:00.220 --> 01:04.280
This is bad CGI or just a model on a string.

01:04.280 --> 01:10.320
But this footage is far more complex and insinulating than initially meets the eye.

01:10.320 --> 01:15.800
Let's dive in and try to determine the authenticity of the flyby UFO footage.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.960
Guys, welcome back to the channel.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.680
I'm your host, UAPGurb.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.320
Let's dive right into this today because I want to dissect one of my favorite pieces

01:24.320 --> 01:29.340
of UFO footage that has kept me pondering for the better part of a decade, the flyby

01:29.340 --> 01:30.780
footage.

01:30.780 --> 01:37.660
If this footage is the real deal, it is the best example of a closely filmed UFO encounter

01:37.660 --> 01:41.020
in the entire public realm.

01:41.020 --> 01:45.980
Former ATIP director Lou Elizondo once stated there is UFO footage leaked to the public

01:45.980 --> 01:50.080
realm that he was shocked had not broken global news.

01:50.080 --> 01:54.740
We can only assume this footage has been seen but labelled fake or skipped over by

01:54.740 --> 01:58.380
the UFO community and internet at large.

01:58.380 --> 02:04.340
During an interview with GQ in 2021, when asked about the gimbal GoFast and UFO Pentagon

02:04.340 --> 02:09.220
videos, Lou stated that these three videos were some of the least compelling out there

02:09.220 --> 02:13.860
and that quote, there's videos out there in government that the public haven't seen

02:13.860 --> 02:14.860
yet.

02:14.860 --> 02:17.660
There's one that's 23 minutes long.

02:17.660 --> 02:21.760
There's another one where this thing is 50 feet away from the cockpit.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.400
I mean, it ain't ours.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.400
We know that.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.120
Sometimes, you just couldn't believe it.

02:27.120 --> 02:31.120
99% sure it's not foreign adversarial technology.

02:31.120 --> 02:34.480
So that only leaves really one other option.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.440
It's someone or something else.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.840
Are these three videos the only videos that you know of that the United States government

02:40.840 --> 02:44.160
has that shows an identified aerial phenomenon?

02:44.160 --> 02:45.600
No, absolutely not.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.420
These are probably some of the least compelling videos.

02:48.420 --> 02:52.340
Some cases, you know, we've seen these things 50 feet away from the cockpit.

02:52.340 --> 02:57.500
On a Joe Rogan experience appearance, Christopher Mellon, the former deputy assistant secretary

02:57.500 --> 03:03.020
of defense, staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated he had seen footage of a

03:03.020 --> 03:05.620
UAP right next to a pilot.

03:05.620 --> 03:11.900
I'm not sure if this is the same footage Lou is referencing, but I am 100% positive

03:11.900 --> 03:16.640
the footage Mellon was referring to is not the fly by footage.

03:16.640 --> 03:20.000
But we are now faced with the mind melting fact.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.240
There are real instances of UFOs traveling within 15 meters of aircraft.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.280
So let's start to break down this clip.

03:28.280 --> 03:33.760
I can only trace this case back to around April of 2008, where it was posted on the

03:33.760 --> 03:40.840
UFO Chronicles dot com titled, quote, flying saucer UFO film from jet window.

03:40.840 --> 03:45.060
The video then began popping up onto YouTube around May 2008.

03:45.060 --> 03:49.900
Unfortunately, I cannot find any record of this clip before April of 2008.

03:49.900 --> 03:56.900
So this is where our trail starts.

03:56.900 --> 04:01.780
At a brief glance, we can see this video is certainly under 240p.

04:01.780 --> 04:07.300
But what we are actually looking at is a recording of a screen, meaning someone recorded the

04:07.300 --> 04:09.960
original footage playing on a computer screen.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.880
So this is a second generation recording.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.320
If we look closely, we can see the reflection of equipment.

04:17.320 --> 04:21.960
One possibility is the reflection of the camera utilized to record the camera screen.

04:21.960 --> 04:27.520
More likely, however, these are reflections of possible objects within the plane's cockpit

04:27.520 --> 04:29.760
reflecting against the glass.

04:29.760 --> 04:34.560
This would likely be a camcorder positioned inside the cockpit with possible additional

04:34.560 --> 04:44.060
reflective catches of a GenTek's MBU-23P pilot respirator mask.

04:44.060 --> 04:49.140
Following these possibilities, we must now consider this footage is taken from inside

04:49.140 --> 04:52.140
a military jet and not commercial airliner.

04:52.140 --> 04:57.500
Well, one such craft exists that has an interior mounted camera.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.900
The NASA F-18 variant, the NASA Chase F-18A.

05:01.900 --> 05:07.480
As seen here, the jet has a mounted camcorder behind the pilot seat, able to film starboard

05:07.480 --> 05:10.200
or portside without obstruction.

05:10.200 --> 05:16.040
In our video, we see what looks to be a jet wing filmed portside with empty missile wingtip

05:16.040 --> 05:17.480
pylons.

05:17.480 --> 05:21.680
Take a look at this cockpit view of an F-18 Super Hornet.

05:21.680 --> 05:28.240
The wing angle matches and so do the wingtip pylons.

05:28.240 --> 05:34.020
Okay, what about the audio of this footage?

05:34.020 --> 05:39.780
We can hear a loud, muffly noise and possibly human voices within the video.

05:39.780 --> 05:41.820
I see two possibilities here.

05:41.820 --> 05:47.700
One, the footage features original sound recorded from the pilot, played back on a device, and

05:47.700 --> 05:51.660
re-recorded from the secondary camera recording the computer screen.

05:51.660 --> 05:57.380
The audio could be pure or combined with ambient background noise from the computer recording.

05:57.380 --> 06:02.200
Or two, ambient sounds from the screen recording location.

06:02.200 --> 06:09.600
Speculating on possibility two, the audio sounds extremely similar to the 2019 US Navy

06:09.600 --> 06:15.840
filmed spherical shaped UFO object going into water, posted by Jeremy Corbell, featuring

06:15.840 --> 06:18.460
ambient sounds from the USS Nimitz.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.460
Check out this comparison.

06:49.460 --> 06:56.100
To think about possibility one, here's the ambient noise inside the cockpit of an F-18

06:56.100 --> 07:09.460
Super Hornet and our footage.

07:09.460 --> 07:15.400
As one Reddit user pointed out, the audio waveform does not cut at second four of our

07:15.400 --> 07:20.120
video where there is a footage cut, leading credence to the possibility that whatever

07:20.120 --> 07:25.120
we hear is in fact ambient noise of a ship where the screen recording was captured.

07:25.120 --> 07:30.080
Lastly, audio wise, you might be able to hear faint voices in the background.

07:30.080 --> 07:34.560
This same Reddit user attempted to isolate the voices and here is what they came up with.

07:45.400 --> 07:59.240
I cannot even begin to guess what is being said, however.

07:59.240 --> 08:07.320
This does appear to be a female voice.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.360
Quickly I wanted to brush over the craft depicted in this video.

08:11.360 --> 08:16.920
This UFO is almost identical to the saucer shaped craft as described by Lieutenant Jacobs

08:16.920 --> 08:19.400
in his warhead shoot down footage.

08:19.400 --> 08:24.720
This craft also appears to be extremely similar to some of the most famous UFO photographs

08:24.720 --> 08:27.840
ever taken, the McMinnville photos.

08:27.840 --> 08:32.600
Notice the protrusion on top of the craft which, as described by Jacobs, is similar to half

08:32.600 --> 08:34.280
of a ping pong ball.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.760
This same upper protrusion is also seen in the McMinnville images.

08:38.760 --> 08:46.000
The craft here also flies at an angle, something seen in numerous saucer images and descriptions

08:46.000 --> 08:48.280
of saucer encounters.

08:48.280 --> 08:55.840
Controversial as he is, even Bob Lazar claimed the disc shaped craft fly quote, belly towards

08:55.840 --> 08:58.960
their destination.

08:58.960 --> 09:04.680
Oh boy, here we go.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.920
Lastly I want to talk about the most enigmatic connection to this case.

09:09.920 --> 09:16.440
In 2021 or 2022 an alleged leaked classified military communications log made its way around

09:16.440 --> 09:21.120
the internet, including a post on the ever famous 4chan.

09:21.120 --> 09:26.400
Now everything from 4chan must be taken with a grain of salt, but these leaked comms are

09:26.400 --> 09:31.840
purportedly a page of a longer classified version of a UAP task force report prepared

09:31.840 --> 09:33.440
for congress.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.800
Let's break down this comms log.

09:35.800 --> 09:42.360
The log details the cockpit voice recording of a fighter aircraft club 1-1 during an interception

09:42.360 --> 09:49.320
directed by AWACS, airborne warning and control system call sign Brigham, which serves as

09:49.320 --> 09:54.160
a flying long range radar and command center that provides tactical command services to

09:54.160 --> 09:56.040
units and their network.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.040
Think of eyes in the sky for fighter units.

09:59.040 --> 10:04.840
And lastly BLK, unclear what this is, they do not identify themselves but they use NATO

10:04.840 --> 10:07.000
brevity language.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.120
The fighter is crewed by a pilot PC and weapon system operator, WSO, sitting in the back

10:13.120 --> 10:15.360
and managing some systems.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.160
Think back to the NASA chase F-18A, the dual seater.

10:19.160 --> 10:23.720
BLK is guiding them to intercept a bogie scene on radar.

10:23.720 --> 10:28.800
The fighter can't see this bogie initially, but at some point the WSO catches it in his

10:28.800 --> 10:35.920
radar and tells the pilot it's coming at them at 2820 knots.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.600
Electronic countermeasures are activated and the crew is alerted that a missile has been

10:39.600 --> 10:43.480
launched at them or that they are being actively tracked by radar.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.600
This could have been done manually or automatic.

10:46.600 --> 10:52.800
The bogie gets so close that from BLK's point of view, both contacts quote merge, meaning

10:52.800 --> 10:57.640
they are overlapping at the current resolution and the fighter's crew have had no visual

10:57.640 --> 10:59.240
contact yet.

10:59.240 --> 11:02.560
They declare the target as quote bogie dope.

11:02.560 --> 11:07.080
When the crew confirms that they see nothing, they ask for further instructions from BLK

11:07.080 --> 11:09.360
who tells them to stand by.

11:09.360 --> 11:15.480
The crew then see an object on the starboard wing quote hanging out about 10 to 15 feet

11:15.480 --> 11:17.000
from the canopy.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.960
The pilot is shocked, however BLK tells them not to change velocity or vector, BLK tells

11:23.960 --> 11:28.560
the crew to quote open your blue envelopes and snooze, essentially telling the crew

11:28.560 --> 11:33.200
to confirm their weapons are off and then to open an envelope and proceed with briefed

11:33.200 --> 11:38.200
mission control procedures which may include radio silence or channel changes.

11:38.200 --> 11:44.200
The described events in this comms log line up almost exactly with the bogie scene off

11:44.280 --> 11:49.000
the starboard wing of our F-A-18 in our video, does it not?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.400
But is this document real?

11:51.400 --> 11:54.240
And does it describe our flyby sighting?

11:54.240 --> 12:00.320
Our footage's connection to this comms log starts to dive into a deep rabbit hole.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.120
And stay with me here.

12:02.120 --> 12:09.040
If this is indeed an online LARP, it was constructed by someone who is very familiar with Pilot

12:09.040 --> 12:10.520
Lingo.

12:10.520 --> 12:14.720
As we talked about, this page is purportedly a leaked page from an appendix of the longer

12:14.720 --> 12:18.920
classified version of the UAP Task Force Report.

12:18.920 --> 12:24.920
Look at the top of this page, Appendix F4B.13 from page 508.

12:24.920 --> 12:31.080
Well, there is another alleged page from this leaked document.

12:31.080 --> 12:35.400
Section 5, Behavioral Data Analysis.

12:35.480 --> 12:44.480
It tells 1292 UFO cases by the joint elements of ONI, NSA, DHS, and SAP-cleared experts

12:44.480 --> 12:46.320
by the DOD.

12:46.320 --> 12:52.560
What is absolutely insane about this document are the conclusions presented on this page

12:52.560 --> 12:59.240
that some UA slash SP unidentified aerial slash submerged phenomena.

12:59.240 --> 13:02.680
This in my opinion gives a little credence to the document giving the distinction between

13:02.680 --> 13:03.680
aerial and submerged.

13:03.680 --> 13:11.480
Anyways, that these conclusions result that UAP are either remote or autonomous drones

13:11.480 --> 13:14.680
or a form of mechanical life.

13:14.680 --> 13:21.320
This document asserts that an, quote, organic species has been deploying UA slash SP that

13:21.320 --> 13:28.240
have seen a rapid increase in flight performance indicating a, quote, stepped virtual evolution

13:28.240 --> 13:29.440
process.

13:29.440 --> 13:35.480
According to one mentioned Shibakoya, gradual changes in the UA SP appearance and behavior

13:35.480 --> 13:38.800
highlight generational changes.

13:38.800 --> 13:45.040
I have done an exhausting search into the names mentioned on this page, M. Harman, S.

13:45.040 --> 13:51.720
McCarron, and K. Shibakoya, and the, quote, blackout flower report and, quote, layer three

13:51.720 --> 13:53.840
behavioral assessment.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.000
But I have found almost nothing.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.840
We have to assume these are pseudonyms used or first names of these people removed entirely.

14:03.840 --> 14:11.000
My only luck has been able to find Juan-Hillary S. McCarron, whose LinkedIn page features

14:11.000 --> 14:17.520
her as a research neuroscientist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical

14:17.520 --> 14:19.040
Defense.

14:19.040 --> 14:25.240
As a neuroscientist, her hand featured on a page allegedly studying UFO behavior fits.

14:25.240 --> 14:31.240
I'll be doing more investigation here, but guys, if I am disappeared, you know why.

14:31.240 --> 14:38.640
At the bottom of the page featuring the names and reports, look at Appendix F, section 4B,

14:38.640 --> 14:45.280
titled DOD 1992 through 2017 High Value Witness Interviews.

14:45.280 --> 14:52.760
Real or faked, our comms log is featured in this section five behavioral data analysis.

14:52.760 --> 14:56.560
These are both featured in the same allegedly leaked document.

14:56.560 --> 15:02.240
The latest contribution to this report was from K. Shibakoya in 2020, and during this

15:02.240 --> 15:10.120
time the UAP Task Force was still running 2017-22, so possibly this is an internal report from

15:10.120 --> 15:12.240
the UAP Task Force.

15:12.240 --> 15:19.400
Could this alleged report be true and subsequent Appendix comm log detail are fly by footage

15:19.400 --> 15:23.440
as a quote high value witness testimony?

15:23.440 --> 15:29.000
If so, that makes our fly by footage one of the most crucial pieces of UFO footage ever

15:29.000 --> 15:30.500
taken.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.800
But still, this footage remains so anomalous.

15:33.800 --> 15:39.280
What's up guys, it's UAP Gerb, thank you for joining me today, look, I'm sorry I'm

15:39.280 --> 15:43.840
a little bit disheveled, I just got back from training, but I wanted to wrap this video

15:43.840 --> 15:47.000
up and see what you guys think about this fly by case.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.080
I wanted to take a quick break from some of our more documentary style fact analysis and

15:52.080 --> 15:56.560
do a little speculation, but you know with me we don't just speculate, we try to break

15:56.560 --> 15:58.000
everything down.

15:58.000 --> 16:05.880
Unfortunately I'm not a CGI expert, I have no experience in any sort of CGI or much kind

16:05.880 --> 16:12.040
of in depth video editing, so if you do and you can perform an analysis on this fly by

16:12.040 --> 16:18.120
footage try to determine if in fact this video has some sort of CGI, some clipping, some differential

16:18.120 --> 16:21.920
frame rates between the object and the ambient picture.

16:21.920 --> 16:26.440
Get in contact with me at UAPGerb at gmail.com and let me know and maybe you and I can make

16:26.440 --> 16:30.880
a part two to this case and crisp it up because as it stands right now this case is incredibly

16:30.880 --> 16:35.680
anomalous and as you've seen there's a pretty wild rabbit hole behind this case especially

16:35.680 --> 16:38.720
with the supposed UAPTF leak document.

16:38.720 --> 16:43.800
So let me know what you think about this case, I know the footage seems a little too good

16:43.800 --> 16:51.440
to be true, but at the end of the day we don't know if it is, very well it could be.

16:51.440 --> 16:55.700
So thank you for joining me, remember to like and subscribe, let me know what you thought

16:55.700 --> 16:57.360
and I will catch you guys next time.
