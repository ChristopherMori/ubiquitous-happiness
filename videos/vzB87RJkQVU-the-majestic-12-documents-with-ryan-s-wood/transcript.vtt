00:00.000 --> 00:05.080
For decades, debate has raged on in ufology about the existence of a committee of elite

00:05.080 --> 00:09.800
military leaders, government officials, and scientists tasked with the investigation study

00:09.800 --> 00:13.120
and collection of UFOs and their occupants.

00:13.120 --> 00:17.360
This now infamous group was revealed through hundreds of allegedly leaked documents over

00:17.360 --> 00:23.520
the course of 1984 to 1999 to be titled the Majestic 12 or MJ12.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.760
Any viewer of my work will know I often reference the majestic documents in MJ12, such as my

00:28.760 --> 00:33.680
Dell Rio case where I bring up the majestic document called the Eisenhower Briefing Document,

00:33.680 --> 00:38.160
in which I reference a December 1950 UFO crash retrieval stated to have occurred near the

00:38.160 --> 00:42.240
Mexican-Texas border between El Indio and Guerrera.

00:42.240 --> 00:47.960
A crash retrieval Lou Elizondo has now stated to have occurred in his 2024 book Eminent.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.240
So with the contentious nature surrounding the majestic documents in ufology, the debunking

00:52.240 --> 00:57.440
work done by professional skeptic Philip K Glass and others, alongside the FBI's work

00:57.440 --> 01:03.200
to haphazardly write bogus across one set of documents to label all documents as false,

01:03.200 --> 01:05.320
why cover the majestic documents?

01:05.320 --> 01:10.880
To me, the analysis of MJ12 and the majestic documents must consist of studying the documents

01:10.880 --> 01:12.120
themselves.

01:12.120 --> 01:17.520
Their origins, content, provenance, and connective tissue to not only other majestic documents

01:17.520 --> 01:22.800
but also acknowledged and declassified files, like the work done by the legendary Stanton

01:22.800 --> 01:26.000
Friedman and world-class Ryan S. Wood.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.160
This is why today I have partnered with fantastic UFO researcher Ryan S. Wood to explore the

01:31.160 --> 01:33.200
majestic documents.

01:33.200 --> 01:38.400
Ryan and his father, Dr. Robert Wood, a former McDonald-Douglas rocket scientist, have spent

01:38.400 --> 01:44.480
decades painstakingly scrutinizing the entire catalog of majestic documents to unravel the

01:44.480 --> 01:47.480
mystery that is the Majestic 12.

01:47.480 --> 01:52.920
Hey guys, it's UAPGurb and thank you so very much for joining the author of Magic Eyes

01:52.920 --> 01:59.840
Only and myself as we discuss the authenticity, origin, and context of the majestic documents.

01:59.840 --> 02:04.880
With the revelations of David Grush in the 21st century, the reality of UFO crash retrieval

02:04.880 --> 02:08.880
and reverse engineering has made its way into the public zeitgeist.

02:08.880 --> 02:13.920
This is why we must take a closer inspection of the highly debated group allegedly first

02:13.920 --> 02:18.040
tasked with UFO crash retrievals, the Majestic 12.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.800
Before we get into the interview, I want to take a brief moment to introduce the Majestic

02:21.800 --> 02:24.360
12 for any newcomer to the subject.

02:24.360 --> 02:30.760
I highly recommend reading Top Secret Magic by Stanton Friedman, StudyingMajesticDocuments.com

02:30.760 --> 02:36.960
written by Ryan and Dr. Bob, my all-time favorite book, Magic Eyes Only by Ryan S. Wood, or

02:36.960 --> 02:40.880
reading the incredible medium articles by Blocked Epistemology.

02:40.880 --> 02:45.680
The Majestic 12 is a group known from a series of controversial leaked documents to have been

02:45.680 --> 02:49.660
tasked with UFO study, collection, and analysis.

02:49.660 --> 02:55.860
The group seemingly rose to power around the time of the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash,

02:55.860 --> 03:01.820
but with origins extending even earlier around 1941 or 1942.

03:01.820 --> 03:08.460
According to Stanton Friedman, the group allegedly consisted of 12 members, MJ-1 through 12, consisting

03:08.460 --> 03:12.300
of six civilian and six military personnel.

03:12.300 --> 03:18.260
Of the military people, two representatives each from the Army, Navy, and Air Force served

03:18.260 --> 03:19.820
in the MJ-12.

03:19.820 --> 03:25.100
The private sector saw seasoned research and development organizers and very strong intelligence

03:25.100 --> 03:28.260
community leaders participate in the group.

03:28.260 --> 03:33.620
Viewers of my Robert Sarbakar video will remember Dr. Vannevar Bush, head of the Office of Scientific

03:33.620 --> 03:39.040
Research and Development, who was labeled a crucial founding member of the Majestic 12.

03:39.040 --> 03:43.780
Other original members named in the Majestic documents include General Nathan Twining,

03:43.780 --> 03:50.260
the leader of Project Sine, a.k.a. Project Saucer in 1948, James Forrestal, Secretary

03:50.260 --> 03:55.420
of the Navy and First U.S. Secretary of Defense, who conveniently threw himself out of a hospital

03:55.420 --> 04:01.860
window in 1949, Donald H. Menzel, astronomer at Harvard and high security consultant to

04:01.860 --> 04:08.780
the NSA and CIA, Roscoe H. Hillencoder, Admiral Navy Intelligence and First Director of the

04:08.780 --> 04:09.780
CIA.

04:09.780 --> 04:15.940
Walter B. Smith, General in the U.S. Army, Ambassador to the USSR, Second Director of

04:15.940 --> 04:18.980
the CIA, and Forrestal's replacement.

04:18.980 --> 04:24.300
And Hoyt S. Vandenberg, USAF General, Second Director of the Central Intelligence Group,

04:24.300 --> 04:25.900
Air Force Chief of Staff.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.500
And this is just a slice of the total members.

04:28.500 --> 04:33.540
I highly recommend analyzing the MJ-12 master list created by Ryan Wood.

04:33.540 --> 04:38.420
Many over the years have hypothesized what the magic in MJ-12 stands for.

04:38.420 --> 04:44.580
After Blocked Epistemology hypothesizes this name is derived from the 1945 May Johnson Atomic

04:44.580 --> 04:46.380
Energy Bill.

04:46.380 --> 04:51.860
Excellent Reddit researcher, user HarryIsWhiteHot, believed magic was some sort of continuation

04:51.860 --> 04:57.500
of a very high classification standard titled MAGIC, used during World War II.

04:57.500 --> 05:02.780
I find myself believing magic is an abbreviation for a Joint Intelligence Committee, possibly

05:02.780 --> 05:07.020
something along the lines of a Majority Joint Intelligence Committee-12.

05:07.020 --> 05:12.140
But without further ado, let's talk to Ryan S. Wood and begin to dive into the origins

05:12.140 --> 05:13.140
of the documents.

05:13.140 --> 05:21.100
Yeah, well, the broad brush is that there's some 3,500 pages over 19 years from seven

05:21.100 --> 05:23.300
different sources.

05:23.300 --> 05:31.620
The first event was in 1984, when Jamie Chandra, which was an L.A. producer, a TV producer

05:31.620 --> 05:38.340
I believe, received the Eisenhower Briefing Document, which Stan Friedman ultimately got

05:38.340 --> 05:45.460
in, outlines the original 12 MJ-12 members in that document.

05:45.460 --> 05:55.980
And that's the one that was taken around to the FBI and several people submitted it to

05:55.980 --> 06:02.260
the FBI, because the FBI is responsible for leaks of classified documents.

06:02.260 --> 06:10.900
And the FBI took it to a variety of three-letter agencies and said, did you lose this?

06:10.900 --> 06:17.180
And they said, well, no, we didn't lose this, we don't know anything about it.

06:17.180 --> 06:23.580
And so after their process, they declared it bogus.

06:24.300 --> 06:32.220
Despite the efforts of Stan Friedman to authenticate a whole variety of people that were MJ-12 members,

06:32.220 --> 06:46.660
and then the other two different sources for that same document that came into the field

06:46.660 --> 06:49.540
years after that.

06:49.540 --> 06:57.140
Some with different marginalia, some with slightly different three-hole punching.

06:57.140 --> 07:05.460
And so, I mean, they aren't stunningly authentic in original paper or something like that,

07:05.460 --> 07:12.780
but there are some other sources of that same document that have surfaced over time.

07:12.780 --> 07:18.260
But it was a briefing for Eisenhower, and that was the first one.

07:18.820 --> 07:23.700
And that sort of kicked things off and got Stan Friedman really pushing along.

07:23.700 --> 07:28.260
Returning viewers of my channel will know the first ever Majestic document quite well,

07:28.260 --> 07:32.260
the top secret magic eyes only Eisenhower briefing document.

07:32.260 --> 07:38.260
This document stating to contain compartmentalized information essential to US national security

07:38.260 --> 07:43.380
was organized to brief president incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower on the Majestic 12 group

07:43.380 --> 07:46.100
on November 18, 1952.

07:46.100 --> 07:52.180
The document labels Operation Majestic 12 as a top secret R&D slash intelligence operation

07:52.180 --> 07:54.900
reporting solely to the president of the United States.

07:55.460 --> 08:00.260
Set up by a classified executive order of President Harry Truman by recommendation

08:00.260 --> 08:05.700
of Dr. Vannevar Bush and Secretary Forrestal on the 24th of September 1947.

08:06.260 --> 08:09.380
Funny enough, in the daily appointment history of Harry Truman,

08:09.380 --> 08:14.980
we can find a meeting with Secdef James Forrestal and Dr. Vannevar Bush arranged at the suggestion

08:14.980 --> 08:16.100
of Forrestal.

08:16.100 --> 08:22.020
The briefing document includes a list of all 12 sitting MJ12 members including General Walter

08:22.020 --> 08:27.540
B. Smith who replaced the deceased secretary Forrestal on August 1, 1950.

08:27.540 --> 08:33.060
And again, we can find an actual appointment held off record with Truman and Walter B. Smith

08:33.060 --> 08:34.660
on this exact date.

08:34.660 --> 08:39.140
The briefing document discusses the hysteria caused by saucer sightings of Kenneth Arnold

08:39.140 --> 08:44.420
in the summer of 1947 and subsequent failures to pursue these discs in flight.

08:44.420 --> 08:50.260
July 7, 1947, oversaw the beginning of the MJ12 with the Roswell crash.

08:50.260 --> 08:56.180
Northwest of Roswell Army Airfield experienced the now most famous UFO crash in history,

08:56.180 --> 09:01.300
which according to the Eisenhower briefing document saw craft and body collection efforts

09:01.300 --> 09:05.060
by General Nathan Twining and Dr. Vannevar Bush.

09:05.060 --> 09:11.620
A soon to be sitting MJ12 member, Dr. Detlev Bronk performed autopsies on the bodies and

09:11.620 --> 09:16.580
coined the term EBE, or Extraterrestrial Biological Entity.

09:16.580 --> 09:22.180
The Roswell team and Dr. Donald Menzel concluded the craft was of non-human origin and likely

09:22.180 --> 09:25.940
originated from a solar system far removed from our own.

09:25.940 --> 09:30.900
The report discusses forms of writing on the Roswell craft, something primary witness Jesse

09:30.900 --> 09:35.860
Marcel Sr. and Jr. would claim to witness on a small piece of metallic debris.

09:35.860 --> 09:41.140
The Roswell report led directly to the creation of projects Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book with

09:41.140 --> 09:45.380
very limited interaction between these official programs and the Majestic 12.

09:45.380 --> 09:49.460
And I'll draw your attention back to a whistleblower I covered, Brigadier General Stephen

09:49.460 --> 09:54.660
Lovekin, who claimed to have observed pieces of Roswell debris in a classified portion of

09:54.660 --> 09:57.860
Project Blue Book far removed from the official reports.

09:57.860 --> 10:04.420
The document then discusses the 1950 L Indio crash, touched on in 2024 by Lou Elizondo and

10:04.420 --> 10:09.300
makes specific mention of the Atomic Energy Commission and Sandia National Labs.

10:09.300 --> 10:13.540
Curiously, near the end of the document is listed a contingency plan,

10:13.540 --> 10:21.220
MJ-1949-04, P-7-8, and just remember that contingency plan.

10:21.780 --> 10:25.780
Tireless work was done by Stanton Friedman authenticating the Eisenhower Briefing

10:25.780 --> 10:28.980
document in his book Top Secret Slash Magic.

10:28.980 --> 10:31.940
But there are two specific investigations I want to mention.

10:31.940 --> 10:36.900
In 1989, Friedman physically traveled to the National Archives and reviewed files of the

10:36.900 --> 10:39.140
Office for the Secretary of Defense.

10:39.140 --> 10:45.220
Within these documents were numerous November 18, 1952 briefing documents for President-Elect

10:45.220 --> 10:51.140
Eisenhower. None of these briefings mentioned MJ-12, but it is fact the Truman administration

10:51.140 --> 10:53.780
was indeed briefing Eisenhower on this date.

10:53.780 --> 10:59.780
Investigation 2 circles around the labeled briefing officer Admiral Rosco H. Hillencoder.

10:59.780 --> 11:05.780
Debunkers of the Majestic documents claim Hillencoder was sent to Korea in 1950 for six years.

11:05.780 --> 11:10.580
However, Friedman was able to determine Hillencoder was indeed present in Brooklyn, New York

11:10.580 --> 11:15.620
in late 1952 when he was made head of the Third Naval District in New York.

11:15.620 --> 11:21.700
So Hillencoder could have indeed been present at the Washington briefings on November 1952.

11:21.700 --> 11:27.380
And many MJ-12 files with Hillencoder as a key individual exist, though they do require further

11:27.380 --> 11:34.100
research. Such as this February 11, 1948 Hillencoder to Truman Majestic Black Book Summaries

11:34.100 --> 11:42.100
document, which makes direct mention to MAGIC. Or the September 19, 1963 CIA Director Hillencoder

11:42.100 --> 11:48.180
to Donald Menzel Memo, which sees the director congratulating his fellow alleged MJ-12 member

11:48.180 --> 11:53.540
on his book regarding what we can assume was successful obfuscation of the UFO reality.

11:53.540 --> 11:59.860
And lastly, we have some key clues on a September 19, 1947 memo from Hillencoder to Joint

11:59.860 --> 12:05.460
Intelligence Committee. This majestic document memo allegedly dated just before Bush and

12:05.460 --> 12:11.460
Forestall's request to create MJ-12 is titled, quote, Memorandum for the Military Assessment

12:11.460 --> 12:18.660
of the Joint Intelligence Committee, end quote, aka MAGIC. The memo requests a classified intelligence

12:18.660 --> 12:25.700
project, quote, we recovered one craft, captured one, end quote. This memo states no clear coordinated

12:25.700 --> 12:32.340
scientific examination was possible until, quote, we got a clear directive from the president.

12:32.340 --> 12:38.020
The memo also states Wright Field had a new biological laboratory, the Joint Research

12:38.020 --> 12:44.660
and Development Board, and the FBI, MI5 and MI6 were helping with the effort. And finally,

12:44.660 --> 12:52.580
guys, back to Mr. Wood. The other one that's really big is the Special Operations Manual,

12:52.660 --> 12:58.820
Extraterrestrial Antities Technology Recovery and Disposal. And that was leaked in 1994

12:59.780 --> 13:05.860
to Don Berliner, who was an aviation week and space reporter in Washington, D.C.

13:07.620 --> 13:17.140
And it was an undeveloped film. I came in a little green box and they went and my father and I and,

13:17.140 --> 13:23.380
well, not me, but my father and Don went to the dark room and developed it and got all the

13:24.500 --> 13:36.900
original images. I'll just pull a couple sheets out just for fun to show you. This is,

13:37.860 --> 13:46.580
you know, came in an echo binder along the edge over here and also became with the Change Control

13:46.580 --> 13:55.380
page, which is difficult to see, but it says Kirkland Air Force Base Unit KB-88 Building 21,

13:55.380 --> 14:04.740
Kirkland Air Force Base, N.M.X. We found that there was a Building 21, I think it's now called

14:04.740 --> 14:13.620
Building 40, back then. And the fact that the abbreviation for the stamp, Kirkland Air Force

14:13.620 --> 14:27.380
Base, N.M.X, is the correct postal abbreviation for 1954 for New Mexico. If it said NM, that would

14:27.380 --> 14:35.060
have been a hallmark of fakery or an anachronism that would be worthy of lots of investigation.

14:35.620 --> 14:39.620
Mr. Wood and myself will speak on the Special Operations Manual throughout this video,

14:39.700 --> 14:45.300
so we will only go into brief detail here. The manual according to Ryan Wood, Dr. Robert Wood,

14:45.300 --> 14:50.420
and Stanton Friedman is equally, if not more authentic than the Eisenhower Briefing Document.

14:51.060 --> 14:56.980
Friedman has even stated, quote, the Majestic 12 documents problem is complex and extensive.

14:56.980 --> 15:04.580
On balance, it appears that the EBD, TFM, and CTM are almost certainly genuine. The SOM-101

15:05.380 --> 15:11.620
likely genuine, end quote. Debate has raged on for decades now, if the document is a hoax,

15:11.620 --> 15:18.020
real, or possibly Soviet disinformation. Later in the interview, we will do an entire analysis

15:18.020 --> 15:23.700
into the Special Operations Manual, or the SOM-101 as I'll refer to it. But for now,

15:23.700 --> 15:30.180
understand this manual, allegedly written in 1954 and initially housed in Kirkland Air Force Base,

15:30.180 --> 15:34.580
serves as a comprehensive summary of majestic operations for quote unquote,

15:34.580 --> 15:41.140
Majestic 12 units, and quote unquote, authorized personnel. The manual contains everything from

15:41.140 --> 15:47.780
MJ-12 full operational capacity and modus operandi, NHI craft and body descriptions,

15:47.780 --> 15:54.340
to MJ-12 recovery and disinformation protocols. Similar to his masterpiece, Magic Eyes Only,

15:54.340 --> 15:59.940
Ryan Wood has attributed a weighted authenticity rating to every document based on factors such

15:59.940 --> 16:06.980
as direct firsthand witnesses, forensic analysis if possible, document source, etc. The Special

16:06.980 --> 16:11.860
Operations Manual and Eisenhower Briefing Document are two of the few pieces Wood has

16:11.860 --> 16:17.620
rated with the highest level of authenticity. But are there others with such high confidence?

16:17.620 --> 16:25.060
But I would also add the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit document, because the governments acknowledged

16:25.060 --> 16:31.140
the existence of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, part of the Stephen J. Chamberlain Assistant

16:31.140 --> 16:37.540
Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Technical and Scientific Directorate, Counterintelligence Group,

16:37.540 --> 16:46.340
IPU Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit. You know, all these hierarchies down in the, you know, 40s

16:47.300 --> 16:54.020
time frame. Well, this was 47 where the IPU document. But what's interesting about the IPU

16:54.020 --> 17:00.820
document, which is on majesticdocuments.com, people can read it. And in my book, Magic Eyes Only,

17:02.100 --> 17:08.980
is details about the Roswell crash, you know, when it crashed at 2332 Mountain Standard Time and

17:08.980 --> 17:20.900
dropped off radar. And it had discussions of body parts inside the craft in the handwritten notes.

17:21.460 --> 17:33.140
And it had discussions of autopsies of the aliens done by Dietliff Bronk and Charles Ethan Ray,

17:33.780 --> 17:40.500
which, you know, when I started to look around, I said, who's who's Charles Ethan Ray? And he was a

17:41.060 --> 17:48.820
medical core expert with Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project. And

17:49.780 --> 17:57.620
and I called up his daughter in Seattle and said, you know, do you think your father could have

17:57.620 --> 18:04.500
autopsied an alien? And she didn't hesitate at all and said, yes, not that she knew that he did it,

18:04.500 --> 18:11.300
but it's clear in her mind that, oh, absolutely, this is the sort of stuff he would have been tapped to do.

18:12.260 --> 18:19.220
So I mean, there, there's just more and more details, stories about the IPU and that document.

18:19.220 --> 18:28.740
And so those three, I mean, each one has its own basket of interesting facts and authenticity.

18:28.740 --> 18:33.780
Viewers of this channel will know recently, I have been discussing the Interplanetary

18:33.780 --> 18:39.300
Phenomenon Unit, the US Army's in-house unofficial department in the 50s for an

18:39.380 --> 18:46.580
assistant chief of staff for intelligence to study UFOs. The IPU initially discovered through

18:46.580 --> 18:53.300
FOIA requests after initial DoD denial exists only through quote unquote institutional memory.

18:53.860 --> 18:59.460
I highly recommend reading Anthony Bergoglia's piece on the IPU. The existence of this division

18:59.460 --> 19:05.860
was first revealed on September 6, 1980, in a FOIA request by Richard Hall and later confirmed in a

19:05.860 --> 19:13.220
1984 FOIA request by UFO researcher William Steinman. It took until the 1990s for the USG

19:13.220 --> 19:18.980
to state all records were destroyed. Even though Hall's 1980 request oversaw the Army Director

19:18.980 --> 19:25.060
of Counterintelligence state all IPU records were surrendered to Blue Book. Anyways, as Ryan stated

19:25.060 --> 19:30.180
on MajesticDocuments.com, we can find two IPU documents within the MJ-12 documents,

19:30.660 --> 19:38.020
IPU Field Order and IPU Report. The Interplanetary Phenomenon Field Order lists a July 4, 1947

19:38.020 --> 19:43.060
correspondence of a situation occurring the day before the memo requesting personnel including

19:43.060 --> 19:48.820
an aeronautical engineer and medical doctor cleared for quote need to know end quote.

19:48.820 --> 19:54.020
And this date should ring a bell as occurring right before the Roswell crash. The IPU report

19:54.020 --> 20:00.820
first made its way into the public on July 16, 1995 and lists astonishing information authorized by

20:00.820 --> 20:07.380
Lieutenant General John A. Samford and approved by CIA Director Alan Dolis. Some of you may remember

20:07.380 --> 20:13.860
Samford giving the famous press conference alongside Roswell General Roger Raimi post the 1952 UFOs

20:13.860 --> 20:19.940
over Washington DC incident. This document explores in great detail the events of the Roswell UFO

20:20.420 --> 20:24.740
including initial tracking and assessment of the two sites of the crash to disk.

20:25.460 --> 20:31.060
A very key clue in this document is the mention that some Roswell Army airfield investigators at

20:31.060 --> 20:36.980
LZ-1, the debris field seen by Brazel and Marcel, thought the wreckage may have been a project mogul

20:36.980 --> 20:42.180
balloon until Los Alamos personnel determined the wreckage was something quote unquote out of this

20:42.180 --> 20:46.900
world. If you know anything about the Roswell crash, you'll know it's often explained away

20:46.900 --> 20:52.420
as a project mogul balloon. And this was revealed after the initial weather balloon cover story in

20:52.420 --> 20:58.500
the U.S. Air Force's 1994 report, The Roswell Report. The Roswell Report states the mogul flight

20:58.500 --> 21:04.500
that was misidentified as a large metallic flying saucer with bodies was mogul flight number four

21:04.500 --> 21:11.620
which allegedly launched on June 4, 1947. However, in 2024 project mogul's field operations director

21:11.620 --> 21:17.220
Dr. Alan Crary revealed with evidence flight number four never took place on this day and was

21:17.220 --> 21:22.900
indeed canceled due to weather. Anyways, the IP report states a radio biological team and

21:22.900 --> 21:29.060
security detail from Sandia National Labs were summoned by Colonel S.B. Housebrook. Chosen

21:29.060 --> 21:35.700
scientists consisted of AEC personnel including J. Robert Oppenheimer, Werner von Braun and others.

21:35.700 --> 21:40.740
And before you say this sounds too fantastical, remember von Braun's mentor Herman Osberth

21:40.740 --> 21:46.180
performed serious analysis on UFO flight characteristics. Twining Vandenberg and others

21:46.180 --> 21:50.660
are named within this report as aiding in the recovery effort and overall operation.

21:50.660 --> 21:55.460
And an interesting line here, quote, it has become known to CIC that some of the recovery

21:55.460 --> 22:01.140
operation was shared with Representative John F. Kennedy, end quote. I'm not going to spend

22:01.140 --> 22:06.740
too much more time on the IPU report, but as Wood stated, Detlef Bronk is named as assisting in the

22:06.740 --> 22:13.060
autopsy. The report then discusses the NHI bodies, body parts seemingly dissected similar to a frog

22:13.060 --> 22:18.020
scattered at the primary crash site and the death of multiple Sandia lab techs due to a form of

22:18.020 --> 22:24.420
contamination. And I recently discussed this contamination in my 1974 Koyama Mexico crash

22:24.420 --> 22:29.620
retrieval case. Based on the documents, Ryan Wood has the most confidence are in fact legitimate.

22:29.620 --> 22:35.780
I asked him to describe robustly what exactly compromises the Majestic 12, how various named

22:35.780 --> 22:40.740
members fit into the group and the impact such an organization had on ufology at the

22:40.740 --> 22:49.860
time of the initial MJ 12 documents being leaked. Well, it's a top secret research and development

22:49.860 --> 22:57.220
intelligence gathering organization that was formed by executive order the president in September

22:57.220 --> 23:06.660
24, 1947. You know, 1947 was when the atomic energy act was created when the CIA was created

23:06.660 --> 23:14.260
and sort of the OSS was transitioned office of strategic services, which was the CIA at the time

23:14.260 --> 23:19.940
into the CIA. And, and they formed this top secret research and development intelligence

23:19.940 --> 23:25.300
gathering organization. And it was, you know, headed by Vannevar Bush, part of the

23:27.060 --> 23:32.580
Office of Research and Development, OSRD. And this is where

23:34.740 --> 23:40.900
Eric Walker, Dr. Eric Walker lived working for Vannevar Bush and ultimately took over

23:40.980 --> 23:50.820
the organization and was widely understood to be familiar with MJ 12 while leading it

23:51.620 --> 23:59.940
in that group. So the names of the people caught a lot of attention and Stan did a lot of work

23:59.940 --> 24:06.260
and has written his book, Top Secret Magic, I think, which highlights a lot of the research

24:06.260 --> 24:14.420
around the various people. He dug into Carl Sagan, which was a person that shouldn't have been on

24:14.420 --> 24:22.900
the list sort of, you know, he was a big debunker. And, but when Stan finally went to the various

24:22.900 --> 24:30.260
archives and dug around, he found lots of correspondence between other MJ 12 members.

24:30.900 --> 24:43.220
And, and so that was, you know, interesting and, and powerful for the authenticity of the document.

24:43.220 --> 24:48.500
But it was again, it was a photocopy. Well, actually it was filmed. It was, it was undeveloped film,

24:48.500 --> 24:55.700
just like the special operations manual that arrived. It might have been from the same source,

24:55.700 --> 25:01.460
but it certainly wasn't mailed the same way. Pay close attention here to the name of Dr. Eric

25:01.460 --> 25:06.980
A. Walker. In my video on physicist Robert Sarbakar, I discussed how Dr. Sarbakar directly

25:06.980 --> 25:12.900
named Vannevar Bush as a key figure studying UFOs within the US government. During conversations

25:12.900 --> 25:18.100
with Stanton Friedman, Dr. Sarbakar, who was a member of Bush's Research and Development Board,

25:18.100 --> 25:24.340
mentioned Dr. Eric A. Walker as a key figure connected to UFO crash retrievals. Walker was

25:24.340 --> 25:29.780
contacted by researcher William Steinman and not only confirmed the existence of the Majestic 12,

25:29.780 --> 25:35.300
but actually admitted his own presence at the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania crash retrieval.

25:35.300 --> 25:40.340
I highly recommend revisiting my video here. So, I mean, going to the special operations manual

25:40.340 --> 25:46.340
that you mentioned with the Ray Z, there's so many hallmarks of authenticity in that particular

25:46.340 --> 25:53.380
document. I could start with the fact that we took it to a retired government printing

25:53.380 --> 26:06.820
officer general, not general, but MacArthur in Washington, DC. He retired from the US

26:06.820 --> 26:14.900
government printing office maybe like six months before we visited him and we went to his house

26:14.900 --> 26:20.500
and set it up on a card table and slid the document across and he looked at it and said,

26:20.500 --> 26:24.820
well, you know, by the title, Extraterrestrial Entities Technology Recovery Disposal, I would

26:24.820 --> 26:30.820
think it's fake. But then he flipped through the documents and saw the disease were raised and said,

26:30.820 --> 26:35.700
oh, this is an artifact of hot lead printing press, besides the fact that he checked it for

26:35.700 --> 26:44.180
everything. I mean, he said the fonts are right. The indentations are correct. The use of M-dashes

26:45.060 --> 26:56.820
in MJ-12 long-dash clearance is correct. The capitalization of first aid was correct for the

26:56.820 --> 27:04.020
period. So, he went through a bunch of subtleties that we didn't understand or perceive at the time

27:05.380 --> 27:11.540
to highlight the fact that it was real in his mind and ultimately concluded that, yeah,

27:11.540 --> 27:21.300
the CIA probably printed it in a cage down on 10th Street. That was his opinion at the time.

27:21.300 --> 27:26.260
With Mr. Wood passionately discussing his authentication methods of the MJ-12 Special

27:26.260 --> 27:31.860
Operations Manual, now is the perfect time to discuss the contents of this absolutely mind-boggling

27:31.860 --> 27:38.900
document. Psalm 1 was sent anonymously to Don Berliner in 1994 and consisted of undeveloped 35

27:38.900 --> 27:45.620
millimeter triax film authenticated to 1954. Labeled top secret magic eyes only, the manual

27:45.620 --> 27:51.780
details the full operational capacity and mission of the Majestic 12. As mentioned by Mr. Wood,

27:51.780 --> 27:56.500
we see the document control is regressed to a singular stamp of Kirtland Air Force Base, New

27:56.500 --> 28:04.820
Mexico. The document control page shows us MJ-12 members, MJ-01 and MJ-04, who altered the document

28:04.820 --> 28:13.220
from 1954 to 1958. Initials listed here are EWL and JRT. Two names Ryan has actually tracked and

28:13.220 --> 28:18.420
we will discuss shortly. And now we get into the meat of this document. Quote, this manual has been

28:18.420 --> 28:24.420
prepared especially for Majestic 12 units, end quote. Its purpose is to present all aspects of

28:24.420 --> 28:30.260
MJ-12, so authorized personnel will have a better understanding of the goals of the group, be able

28:30.260 --> 28:36.660
to more expertly deal with UFOs, ET tech and entities and increase the efficiency of future

28:36.660 --> 28:41.940
operations. Section one, project goals and purposes of this document make some startling

28:41.940 --> 28:48.740
revelations. One, MJ-12 considers unidentified flying objects UFO bees to be a matter of the

28:48.740 --> 28:54.660
very highest order of national security. Two, there would be a negative impact on the public with

28:54.740 --> 29:00.900
general knowledge of the UFO situation. Three, danger present if advanced tech falls into the

29:00.900 --> 29:08.020
hands of adversaries. And four, MJ-12 was established on the 24th of September 1947

29:08.020 --> 29:14.500
under recommendation by Vannevar Bush and Forestall. The goals of MJ-12 are clearly outlined here as

29:14.500 --> 29:20.260
well. One, recovery for scientific study of all materials and devices of foreign or ET

29:20.340 --> 29:26.980
manufacture. Recovery by any and all means by group. This immediately reminds me of the 1974

29:26.980 --> 29:32.500
Koyama case with the American retrieval team finding the craft in Mexico at all costs.

29:32.500 --> 29:38.740
Two, recovery for study of all entities and remains of entities of non-terrestrial origin

29:38.740 --> 29:43.540
through independent action by those entities or by misfortune or military action.

29:43.940 --> 29:48.180
Well, naturally, when you recover something that's either landed or crashed,

29:49.620 --> 29:56.260
sometimes you encounter dead pilots. And believe it or not, as fantastical as that sounds,

29:57.700 --> 30:03.060
it's true. Three, establishment and administration of special teams to accomplish the above

30:03.060 --> 30:07.780
operations, which reminds me for the third video in a row of Christopher Sharpe's article on the

30:07.780 --> 30:14.580
CIA, OGA and JSOC being behind crash retrieval operations. Four, establishment and admin of

30:14.580 --> 30:20.580
special secure facilities located at secret locations within USA for providing receiving,

30:20.580 --> 30:27.380
processing, analysis and study of any and all materials and entities classified as extraterrestrial.

30:27.380 --> 30:33.620
Five, covert operations carried in collusion with the CIA both home and abroad. And six,

30:33.620 --> 30:39.780
establishment and absolute secrecy of all operations. As of the time of the alleged creation

30:39.780 --> 30:46.420
of this document in 1954, MJ-12 does not consider NHI to be a threat, consisting of a benign presence

30:46.420 --> 30:52.100
but with technology far beyond human science. The group had in possession several recovered

30:52.100 --> 30:58.020
dead biologics. Section one general begins to define the scope of the majestic 12,

30:58.020 --> 31:04.820
determination, documentation, collection and disposition of debris, devices, craft and occupants.

31:04.820 --> 31:10.020
This section defines ET technology as aircraft not manufactured by human power,

31:10.660 --> 31:15.620
objects that appear as one of several shapes and configurations and exhibit extraordinary

31:15.620 --> 31:21.460
flight characteristics, consisting of materials exhibiting characteristics beyond science.

31:21.460 --> 31:28.260
And this section even describes EBEs, creatures humanoid or otherwise whose evolutionary process

31:28.260 --> 31:34.660
differs demonstrably from that of Homo sapiens. And now we get to my favorite part of this entire

31:34.660 --> 31:41.060
document, the description of the craft. Elliptical or disc shaped craft appear to be metallic and

31:41.060 --> 31:46.340
dull in color, whose appearance consists of two pie pans or shallow dishes pressed together.

31:46.340 --> 31:52.260
Psalm 101 even lists some dimensions of these craft, they are 50 to 300 feet in diameter,

31:52.260 --> 31:57.700
with their thickness near 15% of the total diameter. A dome extends above the disc,

31:57.700 --> 32:04.340
about 30% of the disc diameter and extends four to six feet above the main body. This dome may or

32:04.340 --> 32:10.900
may not include windows or ports. Lights on the craft exist on the top, bottom and rim that only

32:10.900 --> 32:17.220
function during operation. There's no antenna or projections, but there are three extendable

32:17.220 --> 32:24.660
sets of landing gear. Cigar shape or tic-tacs are considered very rare. They can be 2000 feet long

32:24.660 --> 32:32.020
and 95 feet thick. They do not operate in lower atmosphere and travel at excess of 7k miles per

32:32.020 --> 32:38.500
hour. They do not engage in the rapid erratic or instantaneous maneuvers the smaller craft do.

32:38.500 --> 32:43.860
The ovoid circular or teardrop shapes look almost like an ice cream cone, round at the

32:43.860 --> 32:49.220
large end and tapering to a near point at the other. They are 30 to 40 feet long and have a

32:49.220 --> 32:54.340
diameter 20% of the length. The craft have a bright light at the end point and the craft

32:54.340 --> 33:00.180
travels pointing down. And lastly we have the airfoil or triangular shape. These were considered

33:00.180 --> 33:06.020
new tech due to rarity of recent observations. The craft appear to be an isosceles triangle

33:06.020 --> 33:11.220
with their longest side being near 300 feet length. Little was known about the performance

33:11.220 --> 33:18.260
capabilities, but they operated apparently similar to the disc or ovoid shape. SOM101 then begins to

33:18.260 --> 33:24.100
go into description of extraterrestrial biological entities listing a type 1 and type 2 and thank

33:24.100 --> 33:30.500
you to Bill McDonald for the art here. EBE1's luck humanoid, they are 5 to 5 feet 4 inches tall,

33:30.500 --> 33:36.660
weighing 80 to 100 pounds. They have larger, more rounded craniums with chalky yellow,

33:36.660 --> 33:43.300
thick, slightly pebbled pale skin. They have small eyes, white set that are almost almond shape,

33:43.300 --> 33:48.820
with brownish black irises and very large pupils and gray whites. Their mouths are

33:48.820 --> 33:55.780
wide, nearly lipless. They have fine hair, not confined to underarm and groin. Their body is

33:55.780 --> 34:03.540
thin with no fat and good muscles. EBE1 has small hands, four long digits, no thumb, but webbing.

34:04.260 --> 34:09.620
The description of the type 2 EBE will remind you as much more of a classic gray. They are

34:09.620 --> 34:16.420
humanoid, but 3 feet 5 inches to 4 feet 2 inches tall, weighing 25 to 50 pounds. Their large,

34:16.420 --> 34:22.820
elongated head is larger proportionally to that of a human or EBE1. Their eyes are large, slanted,

34:22.820 --> 34:29.060
and nearly wrap around their head, showing only pure black. The nose appears to be two small slits

34:29.060 --> 34:34.820
above a slit like mouth with no external ears. Their skin is pale blue grayish, fine-celled,

34:34.820 --> 34:40.020
and smooth. They have no hair, leading MJ12 to believe these creatures are not mammalian.

34:40.580 --> 34:46.820
Their hands have three long fingers plus a long thumb. They have four toes jointed with a membrane.

34:46.820 --> 34:51.540
The document then gives astounding descriptions of extraterrestrial technology, recovered from

34:51.540 --> 34:57.620
crash sites from 1947 to 1953. This date range includes Roswell to Kingman.

34:58.180 --> 35:03.300
Metallurgical analyses show the materials were not known to terrestrial science at the time.

35:03.300 --> 35:07.860
The material showed incredible strength and extreme resistance in proportion to weight

35:07.860 --> 35:11.780
and size, appearing similar to aluminum foil or aluminum magnesium sheeting.

35:12.340 --> 35:17.460
Identical to the claims of primary Roswell witness Jesse Marcel Sr. down to the inclusion of

35:17.460 --> 35:23.380
inscriptions on material. In the press blackout section, we find information extremely pertinent

35:23.380 --> 35:29.700
to today's age. Media denial, discrediting witnesses, deceptive statements. There are countless

35:29.700 --> 35:34.660
examples I can discuss here, but I recommend watching my UFO stigma video and paying key

35:34.660 --> 35:39.620
attention to the Robertson panel and Condon committee, and also look at the reprisals against

35:39.620 --> 35:45.300
David Grush. Secure the area, removal and transport, and cleaning the area all detail systems and

35:45.300 --> 35:50.100
protocol for crash retrieval. What is of extreme interest here is the specific mention that any

35:50.100 --> 35:55.940
specific craft or device that appears to be functional is designated to red team. I can't

35:55.940 --> 36:00.260
help but think back to RA and how one piece of technology he observed at the off world

36:00.260 --> 36:05.940
technologies division was designated a weapon during recovery due to an energetic discharge.

36:05.940 --> 36:09.380
But I asked Mr. Wood if he had ever come across this red team before.

36:10.260 --> 36:18.660
I have to look, but I mean, I recall blue, blue fly and blue teams as well. I mean,

36:18.660 --> 36:26.100
I think the term red team and blue team are the same teams, so to speak, in crash retrievals.

36:26.100 --> 36:35.300
But, you know, right in the front description of the special operations manual, they have

36:36.260 --> 36:44.100
they mentioned these MJ 12 recovery teams. And I think in the,

36:46.820 --> 36:50.900
well, you know, at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, they call it the blue lab.

36:51.460 --> 36:56.980
Now onto section 16. Special or unusual conditions has a very interesting note here.

36:56.980 --> 37:01.460
Should the need for public disclosure become necessary, the majestic team was to issue

37:01.460 --> 37:08.820
contingency plan mj-1949-04p-78. Remember this from the Eisenhower briefing document?

37:09.380 --> 37:16.020
We don't have the contingency plan. It's interesting that in the back of the special

37:16.020 --> 37:25.940
operations manual, there's a series of references in the back and they weren't supplied.

37:25.940 --> 37:30.420
That's the missing appendix too, right? Yeah, that's the missing appendix for references.

37:30.420 --> 37:41.060
I mean, it's in the back here. But for example, the photographic references were all correct,

37:41.060 --> 37:46.020
and you can go find them. So they're correctly referenced in the back.

37:47.940 --> 37:56.740
And then there's also the another sort of authenticity point is the UFOB,

37:56.740 --> 38:06.980
unidentified flying object, object identification guide that is listed in the manual, but was not

38:06.980 --> 38:16.980
supplied as photocopies, original photocopies, but other FOIA documents provided a typed version

38:16.980 --> 38:24.260
of it, not type set, but just typed. But when my father re-typed it all, following the format of

38:24.260 --> 38:32.580
the manual, it perfectly matched the page numbers in the table of contents and fit like a glove right

38:32.580 --> 38:38.660
in there. Section 17, extraterrestrial classification table is truly consequential for

38:38.660 --> 38:45.220
analyzing this document. Intact craft, damaged devices, identified and unidentified fragments

38:45.220 --> 38:52.500
and weapons were all to go to Area 51 S4. If you say Area 51 wasn't built in 1954,

38:52.500 --> 38:58.180
we'll discuss this shortly. Media, electronic recordings, maps, charts, etc. were to go to

38:58.180 --> 39:04.340
Kirtland Air Force Base Building 21. Supplies and provisions as well as deceased entities

39:04.340 --> 39:09.780
were to be sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Blue Room. If Blue Room rings a bell besides

39:09.780 --> 39:15.700
Mr. Wood just commenting on it, remember in my UFO whistleblowers video, Senator Harry Goldwater was

39:15.700 --> 39:20.820
denied access to the contents of the Wright-Patterson Blue Room by General Curtis LeMay.

39:22.820 --> 39:31.140
I think the government does know. I can't back that up, but I think that at Wright-Patterson

39:31.140 --> 39:37.460
Field, if you could get into certain places, you'd find out what the Air Force and the government

39:37.460 --> 39:47.620
knows about UFOs. Reportedly, a spaceship landed and was all hushed up, quieted and nobody ever

39:48.260 --> 39:57.380
have never heard about much of it. I called Curtis LeMay and I said, General, I know we have a room

39:58.180 --> 40:05.300
at Wright-Patterson where you put all his secret stuff. Can I go in there?

40:06.260 --> 40:15.700
I've never heard him get mad, but he got mad at me, cussed me out, said don't ever ask me that question again.

40:15.700 --> 40:25.540
And speaking of General Curtis LeMay, and we have we have a accommodation from Curtis LeMay to

40:26.260 --> 40:33.140
Harry B. Cooper, which is the father of Tim Cooper, where many of these majestic documents came,

40:33.220 --> 40:44.260
and for his outstanding work at the USAF UFO program. So I mean, I can supply you that

40:44.260 --> 40:50.420
document. You can put it up on the screen. Let me see it. So that's another example of,

40:52.580 --> 41:01.860
you know, why in the world would Curtis LeMay sign accommodation for somebody for their USAF

41:02.740 --> 41:10.500
program? It just makes no sense that it's not totally real. I'm just trying to find

41:10.500 --> 41:16.980
a copy of it quickly. Yeah, I mean, it's it's hard to hard to read here. But, you know, this is

41:18.740 --> 41:26.100
this is their seal and accommodation. And it's to Harry B. Cooper, master sergeant,

41:26.180 --> 41:31.860
distinguished himself by Meritorious Service as a non-commissioned officer in charge of printing

41:31.860 --> 41:37.460
management branch and non-commissioned officer in charge of camera section, publishing division,

41:38.340 --> 41:43.540
command directorate of administration of services, headquarters, air defense command,

41:43.540 --> 41:53.620
int Air Force Base, Colorado from 30 September 57 to one June 63. So he was in air force base

41:53.620 --> 42:03.460
between 57 and 63 looking at photographs of UFOs and printing all sorts of classified documents.

42:05.620 --> 42:16.980
And, you know, I think it's Harry's relationship to this UFO topic and the friends that he made

42:16.980 --> 42:29.620
during that time that allowed those friends to decide that I want to give stuff to Harry's son,

42:29.620 --> 42:37.540
Tim Cooper, and several of the mailbox drops that had a lot of these documents from

42:38.260 --> 42:46.260
ostensibly the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Officer or Moondust Officer came from.

42:46.260 --> 42:53.060
Back to section 17, living entities were to be directed solely to OPNAC BBS 01. Of course,

42:53.060 --> 42:58.340
OPNAV, not OPNAC, stands for the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. There are some who

42:58.340 --> 43:03.140
guess this acronym stands for the Oceanic Platform for the North Atlantic and Caribbean,

43:03.140 --> 43:08.340
and that BBS stands for the Bermuda Biological Station now called BIOS, the Bermuda Institute

43:08.340 --> 43:14.900
of Oceanic Sciences, but there's really no proof here. SOM101 continues with packaging and shipping

43:14.980 --> 43:21.300
protocols for EBE life and states, quote, loss of EBE life is acceptable, and also details in

43:21.300 --> 43:26.900
figure for the extraterrestrial craft referenced earlier in the document. Here we observe classic

43:26.900 --> 43:32.980
saucer and triangle shapes, but also the conical shape, which closely resembles the 1976 Tehran

43:32.980 --> 43:39.380
Iran UFO case and the Cash Landrum case. You know, in 54, now they have the triangle shape,

43:39.380 --> 43:44.740
they have the ice cream cone shape, they got the cigar shape, the typical saucer shape,

43:45.940 --> 43:54.740
but I draw your attention to the triangles and the ice cream cone, which is, you know,

43:54.740 --> 44:02.580
famous for the Cash Landrum case, and triangles are, this is some of the earliest mentions of

44:02.580 --> 44:07.780
flying triangles. But anyways, let's circle back to the document control page and analyze the

44:07.780 --> 44:16.020
initials, EWL and JRT. Inside the control page, which is typical of every highly classified

44:16.580 --> 44:22.580
document, this was apparently two points above top secret, according to the document,

44:22.580 --> 44:27.060
classifications are different now, and it's pretty much, I believe, an Air Force document.

44:27.140 --> 44:37.220
So, I went to the Albuquerque phone book, pulled it up for 1954, 55, 56, I mean,

44:37.220 --> 44:44.580
the entries in the change control page span from 54 to 57, I believe,

44:46.340 --> 44:52.020
and they had the initials. And so, I looked in the phone book and found all the initials, and there

44:52.020 --> 45:04.340
were two people that Jess R. Totten and Captain Lewis, I think, they both lived on Perimeter Road,

45:04.340 --> 45:11.620
like four or five houses from each other, inside Kirkland Air Force Base, at the right time. And

45:12.100 --> 45:22.340
then, that's in the authenticity discussions of, on the specialoperationsmanual.com website,

45:22.340 --> 45:32.580
it's in my book, and I'm working on a new updated pamphlet that will have the whole manual and all

45:32.580 --> 45:40.900
the authenticity discussion that people can read just easily. So, I found them, and then I hired a

45:40.900 --> 45:53.060
private investigator to go find them. And, well, I actually found one guy, one J.R.T., but he said,

45:53.060 --> 45:58.340
he's not the right guy, despite being there at the right time.

45:58.340 --> 46:02.020
And he was the one who lived on the street near kind of what you found from the phone

46:02.020 --> 46:08.980
book at the time near Kirkland, correct? Well, I didn't go to, so the process is really to go to

46:08.980 --> 46:20.500
the Adjutant General's listing in government document libraries to find their name and serial

46:20.500 --> 46:25.060
number, and when you get the serial number, you can get their National Personnel Record Center

46:25.060 --> 46:35.540
files, and then you can start digging around and try to find these people. And I found one J.R.T.,

46:35.540 --> 46:40.020
which I thought was the right person, and went to his house. He took the meeting,

46:40.020 --> 46:47.300
I was surprised, and pulled out a FedEx envelope with this thing, you know, I'm sure he probably

46:47.300 --> 46:53.060
thought I was from the CIA or something, and opened it up, handed it to him, and said,

46:53.060 --> 47:02.260
is this you? And he looked at it for a while and looked at the initials and said, no, well,

47:02.260 --> 47:07.060
I asked him, well, what did you do at Kirkland Air Force Base? And that time, well, I was,

47:07.060 --> 47:14.820
I was sort of a psychological counselor or officer. I mean, you basically sort of hemmed and

47:14.820 --> 47:26.420
hawed about what he did. But nevertheless, the other private investigator found the kids of EWL,

47:27.140 --> 47:32.260
or the, I think it was the, I have to look at my notes, but wife or daughter, I think was the wife.

47:34.020 --> 47:38.660
And apparently he had passed away, was buried, I think he was buried in Florida.

47:39.860 --> 47:51.620
We have a grave marker. And we got platitudes. But, you know, what you hire private investigators,

47:51.700 --> 47:57.460
they're, they can do things that I just find very uncomfortable. They'll just lie to your

47:57.460 --> 48:03.220
face all the time. They'll lead you on. They'll, they'll, they'll squeeze information on all these

48:03.220 --> 48:12.980
methods that, you know, I just don't have the skills to do. And so I found that very interesting

48:12.980 --> 48:19.140
process. So we did our best to find that. But I would say the smoking gun there is that, yay,

48:20.100 --> 48:26.180
two initials are correct. And they were on the base perimeter road, you know, addresses.

48:27.860 --> 48:33.620
And that was just like, whoa, boy, that's a really good hallmark for authenticity

48:34.740 --> 48:43.700
that it was real. And, you know, I know you mentioned John Alexander in his comments.

48:44.260 --> 48:46.340
Maybe you want to set that up and I'll respond.

48:46.980 --> 48:51.940
Some of you may be familiar with Colonel John B. Alexander, a former U.S. Army Colonel whose name

48:51.940 --> 48:56.580
has been deeply entwined with ufology and government psionic programs like remote viewing.

48:57.220 --> 49:01.300
Not only has Alexander made some outward comments on the MJ12.

49:01.300 --> 49:08.180
Okay, we haven't got time to cover all that. MJ12 was real, had absolutely nothing to do with UFOs.

49:08.180 --> 49:13.700
And if you understand what it was designed for, it was the right kind of people, you don't have

49:13.780 --> 49:19.780
to make explanations as how certain people got in. But the people who did know, I mean, I was,

49:21.060 --> 49:28.900
in fact, what the thing was, at one time I had got rumors of the program. And it was one time that

49:28.900 --> 49:34.660
I went to Stubblebine and said, what about this thing? And he says, we're not going to discuss that.

49:34.660 --> 49:40.020
And it was a super, super secret and parts of it still are and need to stay that way.

49:40.580 --> 49:47.060
In his book, UFOs, Myths, Conspiracies and Reality, Alexander claimed Dr. Bob Wood told Alexander he

49:47.060 --> 49:53.940
believed the Psalm 101 manual to have been created in 1954 with the expressed intention to be leaked

49:53.940 --> 49:59.300
to Soviet spies as part of a disinformation campaign. The intent would be to get the Soviets to

49:59.300 --> 50:03.780
commit resources to UAP crash recoveries. Well, what does Ryan have to say?

50:04.260 --> 50:11.860
Yeah, I mean, I wish I knew what he's up to. I guess I've known John for many, many years.

50:12.500 --> 50:20.340
And so is my father. And he's always wanted to push the envelope and try to squeeze information

50:20.340 --> 50:30.340
out of people or trade information. So he has, I mean, he was in Vietnam, he was a special forces

50:30.980 --> 50:39.460
colonel operating in Cambodia illegally, you know, maybe on orders, maybe not. So he's had a long

50:39.460 --> 50:51.380
history of trying to skirt the edge of legitimacy, in my opinion. And, you know, why did he say this,

50:51.380 --> 50:58.820
that it's Russian Soviet, you know, spy craft? I think it was to curry favor with somebody else.

51:00.340 --> 51:07.700
Because it just makes no sense. I mean, there's why would you expose the fact that you've got alien

51:07.700 --> 51:13.780
technology that is going to write Patterson Air Force Base and Air 51S4 and you got bodies and

51:13.780 --> 51:21.300
parts and a whole retrieval program. And why do so much and then leak it? Why wouldn't you just,

51:21.300 --> 51:32.900
you know, you could put it with one of your assets in the Soviet Union and leak it in a much more

51:34.740 --> 51:42.500
responsible, less visible way. And so from a psychological warfare point of view,

51:43.380 --> 51:52.500
or PSYOP, it just, it doesn't work. It's like you're exposing too much information,

51:52.500 --> 52:02.100
there's no need to create such a fancy document with such high credibility to try to scare the

52:02.100 --> 52:09.060
Soviets. They have their own crashes. No ETs are real. I mean, or China, they

52:09.060 --> 52:17.940
they penetrated the Manhattan Project, you know, within a year to get the atomic bomb.

52:17.940 --> 52:26.260
And I'm sure that they were right on top of the whole, you know, UFO crash UFO thing. So

52:26.260 --> 52:34.260
it doesn't really make much sense in my mind. And the same thing is true with the entire swath

52:34.260 --> 52:42.340
of majestic documents. Is it why in the world would you try to do something over 19 years with

52:42.340 --> 52:50.820
so many documents of so many different different quality aspects? Some are really just photocopies,

52:50.820 --> 52:59.300
other original documents. So it just if you're trying to scare the living daylights out of some,

53:00.260 --> 53:07.700
you know, foreign intelligence agency, it's probably better to do something else.

53:07.700 --> 53:12.260
With all this talk of the Psalm 101, let's spend some time authenticating the document

53:12.260 --> 53:17.300
and spend some time analyzing arguments against the document. Now there is a witness,

53:17.300 --> 53:23.220
Navy Yeoman Dale Bailey, who alleges he saw the Psalm 101 manual when he was assisting in the

53:23.300 --> 53:29.540
destruction of classified UFO material for an admiral in 1976. Mr. Wood is currently in the

53:29.540 --> 53:34.580
process of locating files on this witness from his father's archive, so I may have some testimony

53:34.580 --> 53:39.700
from this individual soon. Within the words of the document, the woods have noticed many minute

53:39.700 --> 53:44.660
details that speak to the manual's authenticity. These include the mention of craft tape when

53:44.660 --> 53:50.900
discussing packaging NHI materials, not duct tape, which is accurate to 1954 shipping methods,

53:51.460 --> 53:55.860
as well as some spelling mechanisms, such as screwdriver being two words,

53:55.860 --> 54:02.340
which was customary in 1954, the capitalization of first aid, which was changed to lower case in

54:02.340 --> 54:11.620
the late fifties, the abbreviation of New Mexico as n.mex, not n.m, which was altered for zip codes,

54:11.620 --> 54:16.980
as well as the solo typo in the document in the word desiccant. And there is, of course,

54:17.060 --> 54:21.860
the point we touched on earlier, the raising of the letter Z, which indicated the usage of a hot

54:21.860 --> 54:27.300
lead press. Many detractors to the document like to point to the cover page and usage of variable

54:27.300 --> 54:32.580
fonts and drop shadow font, but we can find other Army field manuals from this time period

54:32.580 --> 54:38.820
using the same styling. Odd fonts had also been used in various documents, like this October 24,

54:38.820 --> 54:45.460
1952 memo initiating the NSA under the Truman administration. Blocked epistemology has theorized

54:45.460 --> 54:51.060
the usage of fonts was actually experiments done by Dr. Vannevar Bush, who actually experimented

54:51.060 --> 54:55.620
with fonts, such as pictured here in a popular mechanics magazine, where we can see Bush operating

54:55.620 --> 55:02.420
a novel photo type setting machine out of EGNG in 1950. Bush even led the design of the cryptographic

55:02.420 --> 55:09.060
machinery used by the NSA's predecessor, OP20-G. Skeptics of the memo additionally like to point

55:09.060 --> 55:13.700
out a restricted classification on the memo's cover page and how the memo cannot be both top

55:13.700 --> 55:19.380
secret and restricted since restricted classification falls below confidential and top secret.

55:19.380 --> 55:25.300
This is a misunderstood point. According to the 1947 Atomic Energy Act, information on atomic

55:25.300 --> 55:31.940
energy is born classified, even if not created by USG elements. In situations such as these,

55:31.940 --> 55:37.620
restricted data is not a level of classification. A document containing restricted data can also

55:37.620 --> 55:43.460
be classified as secret or top secret. The Psalm 1 was also written during the time that

55:43.460 --> 55:49.300
the restricted classification level was phased out of USG to confidential. So we can find articles

55:49.300 --> 55:54.980
during this time about an extended changeover period due to some issues. Additionally, skeptics

55:54.980 --> 56:00.420
point out the fact that Area 51 S4, as highlighted in the classification table, did not exist in

56:00.420 --> 56:10.260
1954. And this is a very important point to address. Yeah, well, and we found a newspaper

56:10.260 --> 56:19.780
article in 51 basically contractors are pissed off that there was this huge government contract

56:19.780 --> 56:29.860
awarded to a competitor for hundreds of millions of dollars for concrete out in Area 51. And they're

56:29.860 --> 56:38.020
fighting back and forth in the newspaper in 51. And the other thing is it was Groom Lake. There was

56:38.020 --> 56:47.220
a mine, the Groom Lake mine, which was a borax mine there already, that could have been exploited

56:47.860 --> 56:55.140
to be enhanced for an underground facility as well. That could still be researched further

56:56.100 --> 57:03.140
to find out from the mining department and the historical records. Well, how big was this

57:03.140 --> 57:10.020
underground borax mine? How many millions of square feet is it or was it? Where precisely is it?

57:10.900 --> 57:21.380
So you could dig further to provide further evidence there. But yeah, clearly, it was started in 51.

57:22.260 --> 57:30.980
And it's I'm sure started small. I strongly recommend reading Jan Aldrich's 1996 criticism

57:30.980 --> 57:36.340
of the Special Operations Manual. Aldrich's primary criticisms of the manual revolve around what it

57:36.340 --> 57:41.220
doesn't include, such as instructions to tell recovery teams to set up a grid, photograph the

57:41.220 --> 57:47.460
scene and tag each item for future reference. Aldrich also criticizes the use of downed satellites,

57:47.460 --> 57:53.060
which in 1954 was before the time of Sputnik. The use of the word satellite has been utilized

57:53.060 --> 57:58.180
commonly during this time period in literature to discuss space debris. I find much of his

57:58.180 --> 58:03.380
criticisms to be fluff, such as problems with interchanging the phrases MJ12, Magic 12, and

58:03.380 --> 58:07.780
Majestic 12 throughout the document, and can't help but to feel that Aldrich cherry picked his

58:07.780 --> 58:13.620
argument surrounding what is not instructed of the recovery teams. However, I do think his criticisms

58:13.620 --> 58:18.180
are important to understand when reading the document. If you want to read more, Ryan and

58:18.180 --> 58:23.220
Dr. Bob have a massive section on their website, specialoperationsmanual.com,

58:23.220 --> 58:28.740
authenticating the Psalm 101. I highly recommend reading this for a more of a deep dive into

58:28.740 --> 58:32.980
authenticating the manual. The article explores more into the provenance of the document,

58:32.980 --> 58:37.620
including analyzing the anonymous store in Wisconsin where the film was mailed.

58:37.620 --> 58:41.940
With all of this discussion around the Psalm 101, I found it important to touch on the

58:41.940 --> 58:45.780
legitimacy of other majestic documents, especially those that have been found in

58:45.780 --> 58:51.460
avenues such as the National Archives. Ryan had many more to reference. There was the Cutler

58:51.460 --> 59:01.620
Twining Memo. This is Bob Cutler, Robert Cutler to the National Security Council, and it says

59:02.180 --> 59:12.100
M.J.12 Special Studies Group in 1954. It doesn't say majestic, but it says

59:12.100 --> 59:19.860
M.J.12 Special Studies Group. It's the original Onion Skin. It's in the Library of Congress

59:19.860 --> 59:30.420
Manuscript Division in downtown Washington. There's other documents, too. There's one at

59:30.420 --> 59:38.580
College Park in Maryland from the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, which is part of

59:38.580 --> 59:49.300
Paperclip. This says C.I.A. M.J.12 on the bottom of a memo for Project Paperclip,

59:50.980 --> 59:58.740
Project 63, I think. Anyway, there's a couple of examples, and then there's acknowledgement,

59:59.300 --> 01:00:05.700
as I mentioned earlier, that the Interplanetary Phenomenon Union exists as well.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:15.140
It's not like there's no evidence from the National Archives, let alone all the other stuff,

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:21.540
all the other UFOs, Project Sign, Project Grudge, and all that research.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:26.980
Of course, with Ross Colthart's new Reality Check program, interest in JFK and the majestic

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:31.700
documents is at an all-time high, and I was super keen to explore this avenue.

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:36.900
I think it's in the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, one where they say that Kennedy

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:46.340
was given some information or believed to have gotten information from somebody in Congress

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:56.260
while he was before he was elected president. Kennedy was aware of it, according to the

01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:06.340
documents, of this topic and its importance. There's also National Security Action Memorandums

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:17.620
from, like, a week before he's assassinated, where he says to James Webb, the head of NASA,

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:27.380
I want you to share with the Russians the knowns and the unknowns. And by implication,

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:35.460
that means, you know, open the kimono and tell the Soviets all about UFOs. And there's lots of

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:41.220
reasons why Kennedy would be assassinated. But here's another one reason is that you might have

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:49.700
told the truth or pushed harder on cooperation with the Soviets. I mean, particularly after his,

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:56.900
you know, Bay of Pigs, you know, showdown, you didn't want that to happen again.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:02.900
The connection with JFK and MJ-12 does not stop here. Within the majestic documents lies

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:09.380
a re-typed NSA intercept of JFK's hotline talking to the premier about the UFO situation

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:14.900
and national security implications. JFK has also mentioned within another set of documents would

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:22.340
consider to have the highest authenticity rating, the Burnt Memo. In June of 1999, UFO researcher Tim

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:28.420
Cooper received an anonymous letter from a source claiming to be a CIA counterintelligence officer

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:33.700
with documents that would connect MJ-12 to JFK's murder. The source commended Cooper on

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:39.380
his decision to have worked with Dr. Bob on the majestic files. The files included by the source

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:44.980
claim to have been some of the last surviving paper MJ-12 documents after a special classified

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:51.220
executive order from Nixon ordered all MJ-12 documents to be destroyed and moved onto computers.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:55.940
The Burnt Memo was allegedly snatched from a fire before being destroyed and is unlike most

01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:02.980
documents original paper. This memo is from MJ-1, aka the director of central intelligence.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:08.660
The memo is directed to MJ's two through seven in reference to Project Majestic in Jehovah,

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:15.460
Aviro, Parasite, and Parheleon. Quote, As you must know, Lancer, codeword for JFK, has made some

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:22.100
inquiries regarding our activities which we cannot allow. End quote. We can also find a 1961

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:27.940
document allegedly sent by JFK to the director of the CIA requesting an update on the psychological

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:34.580
warfare plans related to the Majestic-12. And here is a very interesting additional point. In 2023,

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:40.020
President Biden ordered some documents from the JFK investigation be released. One name of note

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:45.700
within these documents was CIA agent Reuben Efron, who was intercepting Lee Harvey Oswald

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:52.980
months before his assassination. I do find it a bit strange, the October 15, 1955 Central

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:59.300
Intelligence Bulletin listed operative Reuben Efron as well as three other USG or US military

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:04.580
personnel as witnessing disc-like UFOs when traveling via train in the Caspian Sea.

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:09.460
There are hundreds of majestic documents and the woods have implemented a really quality

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:14.980
scale to gauge the authenticity of these documents. So of course, with so many documents from so many

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:20.660
sources over so many years, I was encouraged to ask Mr. Wood if there were any documents he suspects

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:30.740
are forgeries. Yeah, that's a good comment. At this point, I don't have any information that

01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:38.900
any document that's listed on the website is fake. I have no credible evidence that it's

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:44.900
genuinely fake. I mean, so to fake something you have to have really, what's the specific,

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:53.620
why did you fake it? Did you launch it against a specific target in intelligence? Are you trying

01:04:53.620 --> 01:05:00.500
to mess with the UFO community? Why bother? The general attitude of the intelligence community

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:07.460
or the people that control this secret is to ignore everything and provide no additional

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:14.500
confirmation or evidence. They just try to manage leaks and discredit people. So

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:24.100
that's the methodology for managing leaks. So I would say at this time, I have no evidence that

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:29.780
anything has been faked. Now, I've got lots of documents where you can't do anything more,

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:38.900
like the Aquarius document that came out in the Carter, was allegedly signed by Carter.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:42.340
Yeah, I wanted to bring that up. That was brought forth by UFO researcher Lee Graham,

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:47.620
the Aquarius document package. Can you talk about that and describe it a little bit along with

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:56.580
kind of your feelings on it? Yeah, I mean, it's sort of fluff in my mind. I mean, it's informed

01:05:56.580 --> 01:06:05.700
fluff, but there's nothing to check. There's not enough specifics to validate or check anything.

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:17.300
And it just seems odd that a document like this would be devoid of specifics. Maybe they wanted

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:25.620
to ensure that there weren't any specifics that were checkable. But that's the part that's troubling

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:30.900
and you can't check it. So you don't know what to do with it. So that's why it's in

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:37.620
that Stan Friedman calls the gray basket or I call the neutral basket where I need more evidence

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:45.460
to push it down or up. As we know, the majestic documents were leaked during the 1984 to 1999

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:50.660
era. This time was post Robertson panel and Condon committee where public interest in UFOs

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:56.260
were at a relative low. Only behind the scenes in the 70s were researchers like Leonard Stringfield

01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:01.140
doing serious research on crash retrievals. With the majority of the documents dating back to the

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:06.980
40s and 50s, I asked Mr. Wood why he thought the leaks occurred when they did. But it was really

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:15.300
about Vannevar Bush writing to Eisenhower saying, you know, we have all these celestial gifts

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:22.340
of crash UFOs and we really ought to do something about it. And he said, be quiet, go win the war

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:28.180
and come back to me later. And when Roswell happened, they actually pushed at it and started

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:36.580
this organization. So who leaked it and why? Well, again, there's multiple sources and we don't

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:45.540
really know, but we know that there was two film drops in 84 and 94. Those may have been the same

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:53.860
people, but maybe not two different people. The certain method of delivery and undeveloped film

01:07:53.860 --> 01:08:08.100
was the same. And then there was several mailings from Sacramento, California. There was several

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:22.100
mailbox drops. Some physically put in Tim Cooper's mailbox without postage. It's like somebody

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:28.500
went into the mail room where it was a member of the post office and put it in his mailbox

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:38.420
or cracked his code at the top and stuck it in. And then there was some mailings, for example,

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:45.140
from the Freedom of Information Act office at Fort Meade, Maryland that became physically mailed,

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:52.420
the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers, which is original onion skin. And then there was

01:08:54.580 --> 01:09:01.620
a couple of different documents that were, they had this dash one and dash two in the upper corner

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:11.060
on every page. And ultimately, Thomas Cantwheel wrote a letter at the time of his death or near

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:23.300
the time of his death to Tim Cooper. It basically said, here, Tim, by the time you get this letter

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:32.740
reaches you, I will left this world. So he's dying of cancer. And he goes on to describe

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:43.140
his relationship with Stringfield and Friedman and intelligence contacts at Fort Meade, Maryland,

01:09:44.100 --> 01:10:00.660
Roswell, and then has a sketch of a craft that he sort of drew as the Roswell craft.

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:12.100
And then we also had another letter from Salina, which is allegedly the daughter of

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:19.940
Thomas Cantwell or Cantwheel, which is a pseudonym, you know, it's not his real name.

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:30.500
So, but he worked allegedly at the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit and probably was an OSS officer

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:39.060
in that time frame. And, you know, you don't know what he what he died of other than cancer.

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:52.900
But so that's sort of the broad brush of the sources of materials. And there's so many names.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:58.740
I mean, on the majesticdocuments.com website, there's a you dig around, there's a personnel

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:06.500
the master list right master personnel data list. And I urge everybody to file off your

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:12.260
Freedom of Information Act requests to the CIA and the NSA and the Air Force and Air Force

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:20.260
Office of Special Investigations and try to dig up more information and more FBI files on those

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:28.340
those people and individuals or go to the National Archives. So there's loads of research to be done.

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:37.140
It's just you got to pay people to do it. Right. This is a limited bandwidth. Everybody in ufology

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:43.620
sort of has this, you know, peak of enthusiasm and then it wanes and then you sort of have the

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:52.500
trough disillusionment and then if you keep going, you keep learning more. It's a complicated world.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:57.540
The mention of Cantwheel sometimes mistaken as Cantwell here gives us a great opportunity

01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:02.900
to analyze what we know about the majestic document leaks and their sources. There are three

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:08.820
major sources of document leaks. One, Cantwheel, who supplied much of the material we've covered

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:15.300
today to Tim Cooper, such as the IPU report and field order, Hill encoder magic memo,

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:21.860
first annual report and the JFK to director of the CIA documents. Selena, the alleged daughter

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:27.140
of Cantwheel supplied Cooper with 10 short memos alongside documents like the twining white

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:33.060
hot report, Eisenhower to Oppenheimer memo and directive from twining to Truman. And lastly,

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:38.420
we have source one who supplied the burn memo we spoke about earlier. In his letter to Cooper,

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:44.420
Thomas Cantwheel took ownership for many of the mailbox majestic document drops starting in 1992.

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:50.180
Timothy Cooper investigated Mr. Cantwheel and legally bound his findings in a five page affid

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:55.620
David distributed to Stanton Friedman and Dr. Bob Wood that can be found on MajesticDocuments.com.

01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:00.180
Information obtained by Cooper and shared with Stanton and Bob

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:05.780
include claims of Cantwheel's background. Cantwheel himself stated to be part of the quote

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:11.620
counterintelligence core CIC scientific and technical branch interplanetary phenomenon

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:20.100
unit from 1942 to 1958. According to Cantwell, he served in the CIC until 1980 and worked for

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:27.620
CIA covert operations in the 60s and had contacts with the FBI, KGB and GRU. He claimed to have

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:32.900
retired as Lieutenant Colonel and been involved with the majestic community, Majcom and the

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:39.620
super secret 5412 group end quote. Well respected Reddit user Harry is white hot has spearheaded

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:44.260
an investigation into identifying this mysterious Cantwheel so credit for his amazing work.

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:51.620
Harry has proposed the idea for why CIA operative Boris Dmitry Tarasov is the man behind the enigmatic

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:58.580
Thomas Cantwheel. Tarasov's CIA career spanned between 1956 and 1968 after immigrating to the

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:04.420
US from Russia where his Russian language abilities proved invaluable to US intelligence agencies.

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:11.380
His US Army records from the counterintelligence core range from 1942 to 1945 where Tarasov then

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:17.380
left to the CIC to work for the Red Cross in Cleveland, Ohio. Harry wisely points out this

01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:23.300
Red Cross work likely is a cover story for work on the IPU stationed out of right field which is

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:29.060
located in northern Ohio near Cleveland. Right field also house the army air material command

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:35.060
where General Nathan Twining alleged majestic 12 member was stationed. It's worth mentioning

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:40.100
during his time at the American National Red Cross Tarasov was employed for building maintenance

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:46.980
engineering under a social agency. One must ask why a counterintelligence operator tasked with quote

01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:52.180
detailed composition of the foreign armies and their intelligence services approach and interrogation

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:57.460
of the enemy military personnel and civilian detection and prevention of the acts of sabotage

01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:03.540
end quote would leave for a social agency four years into their career before rejoining the CIA.

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:09.140
Interesting connection here as well in Cooper's description of Cantwheel he states while Cantwheel

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:15.620
was part of the CIA and CIC he interrogated agents in West Germany. We can see on Tarasov's official

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:23.140
record in 1945 the agent attended the advanced CIC school in Ober Erself Germany where he was tasked

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:28.660
with quote extracting the necessary information from the enemy population military and members of

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:33.860
the Nazi party end quote. In his analysis of Cantwheel Cooper also states Cantwheel served as

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:40.740
US Army intelligence in Washington DC from 42 to 45. Well we can find Tarasov attended the Military

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:47.140
Intelligence Training Center and performed CIC work at Camp Richie Maryland a mere 70 miles from

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:52.980
DC in the year of 1945. At the time of Cooper sharing his investigation with Friedman and Wood

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:59.380
he believed Cantwheel to be living in California and to be in his 90s. We can find no obituary for

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:05.220
Tarasov but at the time of this personal history statement titled CIA historical review program

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:12.100
released as sanitized released in 1998 just two years removed from Cooper's investigation. Tarasov

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:18.340
was indeed living in San Leandro California born in 1908 this would have made Tarasov 88 at the

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:23.780
time of Cooper's investigation if he was still alive when Cooper received his letter. This rabbit

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:29.540
hole goes much deeper with Tarasov being stationed in 1963 as a translator operations officer in

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:34.740
Mexico City transcribing and translating some agency surveillance traffic from communist

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:39.860
aligned embassies and other specific targets. Tassarov's work was used as evidence to prove

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:46.100
that Lee Harvey Oswald visited Soviet compounds so of course Tassarov's work dovetails into the JFK

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:51.220
assassination. I personally have my own theory on the concentration of these documents as we see the

01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:57.620
information collected on the Majestic 12 as a snapshot in time in the 40s and 50s. I draw your

01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:05.380
attention to the 1954 atomic energy agreement as mentioned in the 2024 and 2025 Schumer legislation

01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:12.100
which states NHI craft materials and bodies as well as UAP and legacy program information

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:18.100
were hushed away as trans classified foreign nuclear materials. I find it interesting after the

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:25.300
Psalm 101 which was released in 1954 most majestic documents dated after 54 contain nowhere near the

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:32.580
detail on program operations scope and purpose. Perhaps the 54 AEC agreement oversaw a drastic

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:38.180
shift in MJ12 records. I relayed this theory to Mr. Wood and he shared the same sentiment.

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:47.540
That's absolutely true. I think that's when it it sort of happened and and that's maybe why we got

01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:53.460
the special operations manual is that you know the the Air Force officers that were responsible for

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:58.180
this basically got the rug pulled out of them said no no you guys don't get to do this anymore

01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:06.900
it's going someplace else and people were pissed and this guy took it and decided at some point he

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:11.940
was going to leak it. Mr. Wood and myself circled back to the personnel list I touched on earlier

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:17.140
in the video with some of the original members named in the MJ12. I asked Mr. Wood about names

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:23.460
associated with the Majestic 12 that have been overlooked or forgotten about. Yeah I mean it's

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:33.460
in the white hot report it's mentioned that it was really forestall and bush that came together

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:38.260
and said we need to form this top secret research and development intelligence

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:44.260
gathering organization and I think it's also mentioned right there on the the front couple

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:50.740
pages of the special operations manual the history of the group where it talks about

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:58.260
special classified presidential order and James v. forestall and van of our bush

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:06.180
you know formed the group or recommended to the president to do that. Now forestall

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:13.780
you know he had a little bit of a drinking problem and he was very much of the attitude

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:22.100
that we need to be more open and potentially discuss this with more people. I don't know if

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:31.780
he was all the way to go public but he was thrown out the 75th well thrown out the top floor of

01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:39.780
Bethesda Mizz Naval Hospital or fell out the floor or something. He fenestrated as they say

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:46.420
although I don't think it was windows it was you know bars but anyway he lost his life over that

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:51.780
and and actually one of the majestic documents that says it's even necessary and regrettable

01:19:51.780 --> 01:20:00.340
that forestall had to lose his life and my book magic eyes only there's a dedication

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:05.540
to those that have lost their lives for the sake of UFO secrecy and forestall is clearly one person

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:11.220
that he lost his life for that sake of secrecy. So outside of bush and forestall are there any

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:16.020
kind of names that you think as you were talking about how the majestic documents in the master

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:20.580
list needs further investigation are there any names that you think are absolutely crucial

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:26.980
to study and or have kind of been looked over and forgotten about? Yeah I think so there's

01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:38.660
the White Hot Report which is you know it's basically this is the group that went to Roswell

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:46.740
and did a bunch of analysis and worked all over the summer to create this report in September.

01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:54.580
So it happened in July and this everybody went crazy and investigated and wrote up this report

01:20:54.980 --> 01:21:01.460
and presented it to the president and others and there's the members of the mission.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:09.380
You know there's people like Captain Charles Buchanan who the hell is he? I still haven't found

01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:18.340
him and what's his military personnel record file like or Robert Ginsberg, Colonel Robert

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:24.420
Ginsberg or Captain Richard Glass or I mean Carl Hummelstein is a big well-known person.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:29.300
Major General Stephen Chamberlain assistant chief of staff for intelligence he was certainly

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:35.860
a known you know major George McDonald that was his Chamberlain's boss. He was you know

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:44.180
he was like the chief of staff for the Air Force. Admiral Paul Lee he's very well known.

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:49.780
Leslie Groves head of the Manhattan Project he was he had all his team members there.

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:58.900
James Lay Jr. Thomas Lynch which is the finance guy in the Treasury Department.

01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:09.700
So they had you know they got Navy and Air Force and finance people and as well as you know

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:18.580
von Karman and Oppenheimer and Doolittle, James Doolittle and Professor Einstein. So there's loads

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:24.820
and that's just one document where you could dig into the next level. You could write a whole book

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:31.540
on just that one document and all the interconnections and the validations of every single sentence

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:36.980
and every single linkage between people and their correspondence. It's a huge amount of work.

01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:42.340
I mean I'd love to give somebody here's 50 grand. I want you to go write a whole book on

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:48.260
this one topic and go spend a year researching. And as I mentioned before we really do observe

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:53.540
the Majestic 12 as a snapshot in time. Myself and I'm sure every viewer of this video wonders

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:59.060
about the evolution of the alleged group. How they operate today and if in 2024 there is still

01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:06.100
a group known as the Majestic 12. So the documents sort of in the history point of view are stop in

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:19.380
the mid 50s or so with the fifth annual report on Majestic. And I suspect that it's probably still

01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:27.540
has the same name. It's such a rare club you know to lose that history and change the name seems

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:34.900
silly but they could do it. And there's probably certainly a lot of subclassifications

01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:44.740
and different groups that are focused on hardware or bodies. Those are obvious bifurcations

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:50.020
of classification. But then probably within each of those there's probably additional

01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:57.940
classifications to compartmentalize it and get into buckets where they could potentially work

01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:06.740
with private corporations or other organizations. But in my mind it's the aerospace corporation

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:16.420
and the Carlisle group and EG&G and some of them the historical ones I mean Rand for example

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:23.300
was up to their eyeballs and this stuff. And there's probably a lot of them that have done

01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:29.540
research historically. We have heard so much from Ryan about his involvement with the Majestic 12

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:36.100
but another key player is his father Dr. Robert Wood. Why did Dr. Bob a rocket scientist get

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:50.020
involved with UFOs in the Majestic documents? It was maybe 1967 or so 1967 where he started

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:56.980
reading a bunch of UFO books and convinced his management that are we gonna figure out how the

01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:03.140
UFOs work before or after Lockheed does and they they said well how much money you want to try to

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:09.540
work on that bomb. And so he spent internal R&D Douglas aircraft company money and then

01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:17.540
then the merger happened to McDonald Douglas. But so for a couple years they spent the equivalent

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:27.060
of four and a half million dollars working on gravity experiments theory. They interviewed

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:36.420
abductees. I mean I remember as a you know a little boy you know 13-14 going out to the Mojave

01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:46.740
desert and one of his engineers was out there with a magnetometer and strip chart recorders and

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:52.980
they had anomalous events and sleeping on this couch in this you know high heat in the desert and

01:25:53.540 --> 01:26:03.140
it was fun for for a kid at the time. So that was that was his work. They didn't have any

01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:12.900
access to classified information but that was the start of his deep interest in UFOs and actually

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:20.900
he hired Stan Friedman to work for him and look at the nuclear physics aspect of UFO propulsion.

01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:27.380
Viewers of my channel will remember Project Moondust an official group proposed in 1961

01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:34.180
by the U.S. Air Force alongside projects Blue Fly and UFO. Moondust was tasked to quote locate,

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:40.260
recover and deliver descended foreign space vehicles and quote. Moondust counterpart Blue Fly

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:45.940
served to quote facilitate expeditious delivery to foreign technology division of Moondust or

01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:51.700
other items of great technological intelligence interest and quote. In my video on Moondust we

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:57.940
covered a variety of fascinating cases occurring in Nepal, Afghanistan, Canada and a 1965 case in

01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:03.780
the Congo with an accompanying memo titled fragment metal recovered in the Republic of the Congo.

01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:09.380
Origin believed to be an unidentified flying object. Moondust does indeed have connections to

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:14.020
the majestic documents in a fascinating original document called the Bowen manuscript.

01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:23.220
Oh yeah I mean Moondust is definitely a recovery organization. I mean it's space junk primarily

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:31.460
but occasionally it's you know down saucers and so if there's some obvious evidence that it's a

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:39.220
saucer they may have a different team that goes but the Moondust people were very much involved

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:49.060
um and so that's logical that they would do that. I guess I wanted to bring up one final

01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:56.740
thought for you is that many people say oh these are all photocopies uh and um and I guess I just

01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:03.700
wanted to highlight you know one of the leaked ones um well sent from Fort Meade from Freedom

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:10.900
Information Act office was this one Top Secret Magic. This is original onion skin

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:22.900
paper that we've done forensic analysis on and for ink and pencil marks and it has

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:30.740
commenced by Vannevar Bush and it has hints of we have anti-gravity craft in you know 1960s.

01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:38.500
Uh the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers the the Bowen manuscript and actually there's a book

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:44.980
that um it's on Amazon called the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers by Vernon Bowen who who wrote it and

01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:56.500
it's uh it's very well done history of UFO cases from 1960 and before so that's when

01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:07.060
he typed it sent it into the Air Force and never got it back until um 39 years later. Wow and the

01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:14.900
document has comments from Vannevar Bush. Yeah it's yeah it's like there's there's comments in

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:20.900
marginalia and in pan and ink marks like you know what is Don Menzel doing question mark

01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:30.820
in relation to these comments in the topic and then uh another one was um in relation to

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:42.260
could these craft be our man-made uh uh you know experimental vehicles and hand written on the side

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:52.580
in ink is this should not get out uh implying in my mind that uh very of deep concern that we're

01:29:53.220 --> 01:30:01.620
got gravity control craft. Wow. And so that's uh that's juicy. My research and my father's

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:09.140
research on the majestic documents is um rich and robust and highly supportive of their authenticity

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:17.060
and credibility and I welcome objections to it and if if you have some it's fake because uh statement

01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:26.020
or I don't like it because I'm all ears but I've not found any credible objections. All right thank

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:32.660
you so much Mr. Wood. Thank you. What's up guys thank you so much for joining me into this

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:38.260
investigation and documentary on the majestic 12 and majestic documents. Before I get into my

01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:44.500
usual ramblings at the end of every video I need to say a couple things one thank you Mr. Ryan S. Wood

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:49.540
thank you for sitting down with me doing this interview answering hours of questions and emails

01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:54.420
in the majestic documents the majestic 12 me requesting additional files me requesting images

01:30:54.420 --> 01:31:01.140
and so forth this man is truly of incredible character and I am so thankful one of my biggest

01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:06.180
inspirations in the field of ufology agreed to sit down with me and cover the majestic documents.

01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:09.860
For anybody who has watched a single one of my videos you know I reference

01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:15.700
this book magic eyes only as the greatest book I have ever read on UFO crash retrievals by Ryan S.

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:20.660
Wood. I highly encourage anybody to purchase this book because it also covers much of the majestic

01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:25.620
12 including the authenticating of the special operations manual. It also includes a full copy

01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:31.220
of the special operations manual. Third Ryan S. Wood has a beautiful tool I don't see referenced

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:39.700
much this is a website called ufo decks ufo dex.com what this is Ryan S. Wood trained a chat GPT

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:46.580
model and scanned in between 500 and 800 UFO books you can submit a question on any topic in

01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:52.260
ufology and receive an answer from Mr. Wood. I myself have used this tool dozens of times

01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:58.900
and I've used it in a lot of my past research such as referencing the 1974 koyame case discussing a

01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:03.300
certain private corporation I'm going to cover soon and I even asked it about underwater bases

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:10.340
that NHI might inhabit after reading and hearing about some parts of Lou Elizondo's new statements.

01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:16.020
So thank you Mr. Wood please get a copy of magic eyes only please go to majesticdocuments.com where

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:22.020
you can read all 33 or 35 of the reports I referenced today in depth of course with

01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:25.780
YouTube video descriptions it's a little too tough to include all links especially when I have

01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:31.380
between 50 and 60 research files so you'll look in the video description you will see every document

01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:36.180
we covered today which is over 30 you'll find the exact name go to majesticdocuments.com punch

01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:40.500
that in copy and paste it review the document while watching the video I think that's really

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:44.020
important when we're discussing a document you can have it on another monitor I'm part of your

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:47.460
screen kind of read through what we're going through you know me I like to cite my work so

01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:53.300
all of these documents will be available for you to read super easily okay onto my ramblings the

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:58.580
majestic 12 has consumed my life for the past couple of weeks to the point where I have not even

01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:05.540
touched this and this is going to be my next reading I cannot wait to dive in but I highly

01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:11.460
recommend anybody get the majestic magic eyes only book and a book I referenced multiple times in

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:16.420
the video top secret magic by Stanton Friedman if you want to learn more until the authentication

01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:21.780
of the Eisenhower briefing document Cutler 20 memo Truman forest all memo this is the book for you

01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:28.260
it was written in the 90s but this is a beautiful piece that's so useful to investigate more into

01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:34.420
what we've been talking about today Stanton Friedman is a legend amongst Ryan Wood Robert Wood so

01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:39.620
please check out this book if you want to learn more it's fantastic so now we can get onto some

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:44.180
of my thoughts anybody who's watched my videos knows more and more over time I've been referencing

01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:49.380
the majestic documents a perfect example is my last video the 1974 koyame crash retrieval

01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:55.620
I referenced the first annual majestic report as well as the ipu report before that in my 1955

01:33:55.620 --> 01:34:00.820
crash video near del Rio Texas I referenced the Eisenhower briefing document in the 1950 crash

01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:05.140
listed there also touched on by Lou Elizondo to have occurred near El Indio in Guerrero

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:10.740
I made some statements public that I thought that the majestic 12 was likely a real organization

01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:16.420
and the majestic files had probably been a mix of information and disinformation at that time I

01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:21.140
had not spent the amount of time I have now pouring through the documents looking at connections

01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:26.980
looking at research and just immersing myself in so much time I think the majestic 12 encompasses

01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:34.020
so much more than what I initially suspected uh what really took me by surprise was the amount

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:38.980
of length behind authenticating the Eisenhower briefing document and special operations manual

01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:43.780
those of course are two of the big heavy hitters we talk about this in this stock in this video

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:49.220
but towards the end of the video you'll remember the bowen manuscript and you remember how

01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:55.700
the author bowen I can't remember his first name sent this into the Department of Defense in 1960

01:34:55.700 --> 01:35:02.100
to get it reviewed he never got a copy back it wasn't until 1999 Timothy Cooper got this uh

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:09.620
from a foyer designation Fort Mead with comments all over it from vanavar bush and stamp top secret

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:15.060
magic now of course we discussed how this referenced moondust uh that vanavar bush made

01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:23.940
comments on uh anti-gravity vehicles but this the discussion of moondust and insect like beans

01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:29.380
reminded me so much of Dr. Sarbacher and of course I discussed that video Dr. Sarbacher

01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:35.700
multiple times but we have to remember that within the majestic files one if not the key player is

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:41.540
Dr. vanavar bush of course the beginning of the majestic leaks occurred in 1980 but the thing is

01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:50.340
we can trace Dr. Robert Sarbacher discussing vanavar bush directing UFO study in the U.S.

01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:57.140
government as far back as 1950 around the time of the alleged mj-12 connection so I never thought

01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:02.260
the Sarbacher connections would go so deep here remember Dr. Sarbacher even when talking to uh

01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:08.180
Stanton Freeman namedrop Dr. Eric Walker Dr. Eric Walker himself confirmed to know of the mj-12's

01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:14.660
existence to say it's real along with a really interesting quote that reminded me of Don Quixote

01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:18.500
chasing at windmills perhaps what he meant by this is you might have the majestic documents

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:23.860
because I believe this uh interview came out in the mid to late 80s Sweden have all the majestic

01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:29.460
documents I think that he may have meant you might have these majestic documents you may be able to

01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:34.660
read them but you will never get to the bottom of it it's futile to try and fully grasp the

01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:39.460
extent of the majestic files and speaking of Dr. Eric Walker what really interests me thinking

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:45.300
about now is how his claims about a ESP getting into the program and so forth so that was just

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:49.940
fascinating to me the connections with Sarbacher because remember Sarbacher described insect like

01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:55.940
beans as well in the encyclopedia flying saucers vanavar bush underlining these subjects is so

01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:01.860
fascinating and let's not forget at the end of the 14 page sample provided on majesticdocuments.com

01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:07.140
there's a section talking about Mussolini and Hitler uh being exposed to some sort of craft

01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:13.380
in 1942 vanavar bush underlines this as well almost underlines a whole paragraph this brings

01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:19.460
my mind back to the 1933 magenta italy case anybody else it's just it's really fascinating um

01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:24.580
some of the other documents that really interest me of course are the ipu report

01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:28.660
nine pages talks about the sandia lab technicians talks about the crew at roswell

01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:34.340
so much of these documents kind of focus around roswell right i think there's so much more work

01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:39.300
to be done on the jfk assassination in mj12 so much more work to be done on forestall's death in the

01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:44.820
mj12 because that's very interesting i think many people think of a conspiracy around forestall's

01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:50.340
death as well throwing himself out the 13th story of a of a naval hospital room so there's

01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:53.380
so much more work to be done there and there's so much more work to be done on the majestic

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:59.620
documents in general right uh as mr wood has said much of these documents as he likes to say

01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:04.580
are onion skin where we have original copies in fact i'd say that's the minority of the reports

01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:10.100
many of them are facts from triax film uh photo copies and so forth so there's some provenance

01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:15.540
work that can't be done on these documents like mr wood has done with the bow and manuscript actually

01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:22.340
dating the ink back to 1962 of when vanavar bush wrote moondust on the the paper so

01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:29.540
i think if we look at the majestic 12 we can't argue for the validity of all of these documents

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:36.900
but i think it is a safe line of research to kind of understand the majestic 12 likely was

01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:42.900
likely was and possibly is a real group tasked with the study material exploitation

01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:49.460
and reverse engineering and crash retrieval of ufo's how that looks today i would reckon

01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:54.420
it involves much more of a private sector uh as beautiful as it is with the sarbacher video we

01:38:54.420 --> 01:39:00.420
get to see a snapshot of the early days of ufo crash retrieval and i think the majestic documents

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:06.020
are the perfect example of really investigating the early days the early players the early

01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:12.180
organization and the early procedures of ufo crash retrieval but anyway guys remember magic eyes
