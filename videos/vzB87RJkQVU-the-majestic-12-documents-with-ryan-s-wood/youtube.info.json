    "description": "A conversation and documentary on the Majestic-12 Documents with UFO researcher and Author of \"Majic Eyes Only\" Ryan S. Wood.\n\nThe Majestic-12 is a highly debated, well-known group of alleged scientists and military personnel tasked with UFO recovery, reverse engineering, analysis, and disinformation. The MJ-12 was brought to light from a series of contested leaked documents discussing the group. During 1984-1999, over 109 documents containing 3,500 pages were leaked to UFO researchers detailing the shadowy organization and its members. From Generals such as Nathan Twinning to scientists like Dr. Vannevar Bush and J. Robert Oppenheimer, the MJ-12 has allegedly included some of the 20th century's best and brightest. \n\nDebate has raged on for decades but respected UFO researchers Stanton Friedman and Ryan/Robert Wood have argued for the authenticity of many of the documents and the MJ-12 group due to decades of rigorous study on the documents' context, provenance, discussion, and connective tissue to other MJ-12 Documents and declassified documents. \n\nThe MJ12 has long been considered a conspiracy especially after a haphazard and lazy debunk by the FBI. But are there clues in the Majestic-12 documents that can help us assemble pieces to discover the reality behind the infamous group? Join Mr. Wood and myself as we discuss over 30 documents and dive into the enigmatic group that is the MJ-12!\n\nNOTE: All Majestic documents referenced can be found on majesticdocuments.com.
