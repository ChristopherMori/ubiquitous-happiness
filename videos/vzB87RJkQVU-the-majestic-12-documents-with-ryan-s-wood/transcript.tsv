0	5080	For decades, debate has raged on in ufology about the existence of a committee of elite
5080	9800	military leaders, government officials, and scientists tasked with the investigation study
9800	13120	and collection of UFOs and their occupants.
13120	17360	This now infamous group was revealed through hundreds of allegedly leaked documents over
17360	23520	the course of 1984 to 1999 to be titled the Majestic 12 or MJ12.
23520	28760	Any viewer of my work will know I often reference the majestic documents in MJ12, such as my
28760	33680	Dell Rio case where I bring up the majestic document called the Eisenhower Briefing Document,
33680	38160	in which I reference a December 1950 UFO crash retrieval stated to have occurred near the
38160	42240	Mexican-Texas border between El Indio and Guerrera.
42240	47960	A crash retrieval Lou Elizondo has now stated to have occurred in his 2024 book Eminent.
47960	52240	So with the contentious nature surrounding the majestic documents in ufology, the debunking
52240	57440	work done by professional skeptic Philip K Glass and others, alongside the FBI's work
57440	63200	to haphazardly write bogus across one set of documents to label all documents as false,
63200	65320	why cover the majestic documents?
65320	70880	To me, the analysis of MJ12 and the majestic documents must consist of studying the documents
70880	72120	themselves.
72120	77520	Their origins, content, provenance, and connective tissue to not only other majestic documents
77520	82800	but also acknowledged and declassified files, like the work done by the legendary Stanton
82800	86000	Friedman and world-class Ryan S. Wood.
86000	91160	This is why today I have partnered with fantastic UFO researcher Ryan S. Wood to explore the
91160	93200	majestic documents.
93200	98400	Ryan and his father, Dr. Robert Wood, a former McDonald-Douglas rocket scientist, have spent
98400	104480	decades painstakingly scrutinizing the entire catalog of majestic documents to unravel the
104480	107480	mystery that is the Majestic 12.
107480	112920	Hey guys, it's UAPGurb and thank you so very much for joining the author of Magic Eyes
112920	119840	Only and myself as we discuss the authenticity, origin, and context of the majestic documents.
119840	124880	With the revelations of David Grush in the 21st century, the reality of UFO crash retrieval
124880	128880	and reverse engineering has made its way into the public zeitgeist.
128880	133920	This is why we must take a closer inspection of the highly debated group allegedly first
133920	138040	tasked with UFO crash retrievals, the Majestic 12.
138040	141800	Before we get into the interview, I want to take a brief moment to introduce the Majestic
141800	144360	12 for any newcomer to the subject.
144360	150760	I highly recommend reading Top Secret Magic by Stanton Friedman, StudyingMajesticDocuments.com
150760	156960	written by Ryan and Dr. Bob, my all-time favorite book, Magic Eyes Only by Ryan S. Wood, or
156960	160880	reading the incredible medium articles by Blocked Epistemology.
160880	165680	The Majestic 12 is a group known from a series of controversial leaked documents to have been
165680	169660	tasked with UFO study, collection, and analysis.
169660	175860	The group seemingly rose to power around the time of the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash,
175860	181820	but with origins extending even earlier around 1941 or 1942.
181820	188460	According to Stanton Friedman, the group allegedly consisted of 12 members, MJ-1 through 12, consisting
188460	192300	of six civilian and six military personnel.
192300	198260	Of the military people, two representatives each from the Army, Navy, and Air Force served
198260	199820	in the MJ-12.
199820	205100	The private sector saw seasoned research and development organizers and very strong intelligence
205100	208260	community leaders participate in the group.
208260	213620	Viewers of my Robert Sarbakar video will remember Dr. Vannevar Bush, head of the Office of Scientific
213620	219040	Research and Development, who was labeled a crucial founding member of the Majestic 12.
219040	223780	Other original members named in the Majestic documents include General Nathan Twining,
223780	230260	the leader of Project Sine, a.k.a. Project Saucer in 1948, James Forrestal, Secretary
230260	235420	of the Navy and First U.S. Secretary of Defense, who conveniently threw himself out of a hospital
235420	241860	window in 1949, Donald H. Menzel, astronomer at Harvard and high security consultant to
241860	248780	the NSA and CIA, Roscoe H. Hillencoder, Admiral Navy Intelligence and First Director of the
248780	249780	CIA.
249780	255940	Walter B. Smith, General in the U.S. Army, Ambassador to the USSR, Second Director of
255940	258980	the CIA, and Forrestal's replacement.
258980	264300	And Hoyt S. Vandenberg, USAF General, Second Director of the Central Intelligence Group,
264300	265900	Air Force Chief of Staff.
265900	268500	And this is just a slice of the total members.
268500	273540	I highly recommend analyzing the MJ-12 master list created by Ryan Wood.
273540	278420	Many over the years have hypothesized what the magic in MJ-12 stands for.
278420	284580	After Blocked Epistemology hypothesizes this name is derived from the 1945 May Johnson Atomic
284580	286380	Energy Bill.
286380	291860	Excellent Reddit researcher, user HarryIsWhiteHot, believed magic was some sort of continuation
291860	297500	of a very high classification standard titled MAGIC, used during World War II.
297500	302780	I find myself believing magic is an abbreviation for a Joint Intelligence Committee, possibly
302780	307020	something along the lines of a Majority Joint Intelligence Committee-12.
307020	312140	But without further ado, let's talk to Ryan S. Wood and begin to dive into the origins
312140	313140	of the documents.
313140	321100	Yeah, well, the broad brush is that there's some 3,500 pages over 19 years from seven
321100	323300	different sources.
323300	331620	The first event was in 1984, when Jamie Chandra, which was an L.A. producer, a TV producer
331620	338340	I believe, received the Eisenhower Briefing Document, which Stan Friedman ultimately got
338340	345460	in, outlines the original 12 MJ-12 members in that document.
345460	355980	And that's the one that was taken around to the FBI and several people submitted it to
355980	362260	the FBI, because the FBI is responsible for leaks of classified documents.
362260	370900	And the FBI took it to a variety of three-letter agencies and said, did you lose this?
370900	377180	And they said, well, no, we didn't lose this, we don't know anything about it.
377180	383580	And so after their process, they declared it bogus.
384300	392220	Despite the efforts of Stan Friedman to authenticate a whole variety of people that were MJ-12 members,
392220	406660	and then the other two different sources for that same document that came into the field
406660	409540	years after that.
409540	417140	Some with different marginalia, some with slightly different three-hole punching.
417140	425460	And so, I mean, they aren't stunningly authentic in original paper or something like that,
425460	432780	but there are some other sources of that same document that have surfaced over time.
432780	438260	But it was a briefing for Eisenhower, and that was the first one.
438820	443700	And that sort of kicked things off and got Stan Friedman really pushing along.
443700	448260	Returning viewers of my channel will know the first ever Majestic document quite well,
448260	452260	the top secret magic eyes only Eisenhower briefing document.
452260	458260	This document stating to contain compartmentalized information essential to US national security
458260	463380	was organized to brief president incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower on the Majestic 12 group
463380	466100	on November 18, 1952.
466100	472180	The document labels Operation Majestic 12 as a top secret R&D slash intelligence operation
472180	474900	reporting solely to the president of the United States.
475460	480260	Set up by a classified executive order of President Harry Truman by recommendation
480260	485700	of Dr. Vannevar Bush and Secretary Forrestal on the 24th of September 1947.
486260	489380	Funny enough, in the daily appointment history of Harry Truman,
489380	494980	we can find a meeting with Secdef James Forrestal and Dr. Vannevar Bush arranged at the suggestion
494980	496100	of Forrestal.
496100	502020	The briefing document includes a list of all 12 sitting MJ12 members including General Walter
502020	507540	B. Smith who replaced the deceased secretary Forrestal on August 1, 1950.
507540	513060	And again, we can find an actual appointment held off record with Truman and Walter B. Smith
513060	514660	on this exact date.
514660	519140	The briefing document discusses the hysteria caused by saucer sightings of Kenneth Arnold
519140	524420	in the summer of 1947 and subsequent failures to pursue these discs in flight.
524420	530260	July 7, 1947, oversaw the beginning of the MJ12 with the Roswell crash.
530260	536180	Northwest of Roswell Army Airfield experienced the now most famous UFO crash in history,
536180	541300	which according to the Eisenhower briefing document saw craft and body collection efforts
541300	545060	by General Nathan Twining and Dr. Vannevar Bush.
545060	551620	A soon to be sitting MJ12 member, Dr. Detlev Bronk performed autopsies on the bodies and
551620	556580	coined the term EBE, or Extraterrestrial Biological Entity.
556580	562180	The Roswell team and Dr. Donald Menzel concluded the craft was of non-human origin and likely
562180	565940	originated from a solar system far removed from our own.
565940	570900	The report discusses forms of writing on the Roswell craft, something primary witness Jesse
570900	575860	Marcel Sr. and Jr. would claim to witness on a small piece of metallic debris.
575860	581140	The Roswell report led directly to the creation of projects Sine, Grudge, and Blue Book with
581140	585380	very limited interaction between these official programs and the Majestic 12.
585380	589460	And I'll draw your attention back to a whistleblower I covered, Brigadier General Stephen
589460	594660	Lovekin, who claimed to have observed pieces of Roswell debris in a classified portion of
594660	597860	Project Blue Book far removed from the official reports.
597860	604420	The document then discusses the 1950 L Indio crash, touched on in 2024 by Lou Elizondo and
604420	609300	makes specific mention of the Atomic Energy Commission and Sandia National Labs.
609300	613540	Curiously, near the end of the document is listed a contingency plan,
613540	621220	MJ-1949-04, P-7-8, and just remember that contingency plan.
621780	625780	Tireless work was done by Stanton Friedman authenticating the Eisenhower Briefing
625780	628980	document in his book Top Secret Slash Magic.
628980	631940	But there are two specific investigations I want to mention.
631940	636900	In 1989, Friedman physically traveled to the National Archives and reviewed files of the
636900	639140	Office for the Secretary of Defense.
639140	645220	Within these documents were numerous November 18, 1952 briefing documents for President-Elect
645220	651140	Eisenhower. None of these briefings mentioned MJ-12, but it is fact the Truman administration
651140	653780	was indeed briefing Eisenhower on this date.
653780	659780	Investigation 2 circles around the labeled briefing officer Admiral Rosco H. Hillencoder.
659780	665780	Debunkers of the Majestic documents claim Hillencoder was sent to Korea in 1950 for six years.
665780	670580	However, Friedman was able to determine Hillencoder was indeed present in Brooklyn, New York
670580	675620	in late 1952 when he was made head of the Third Naval District in New York.
675620	681700	So Hillencoder could have indeed been present at the Washington briefings on November 1952.
681700	687380	And many MJ-12 files with Hillencoder as a key individual exist, though they do require further
687380	694100	research. Such as this February 11, 1948 Hillencoder to Truman Majestic Black Book Summaries
694100	702100	document, which makes direct mention to MAGIC. Or the September 19, 1963 CIA Director Hillencoder
702100	708180	to Donald Menzel Memo, which sees the director congratulating his fellow alleged MJ-12 member
708180	713540	on his book regarding what we can assume was successful obfuscation of the UFO reality.
713540	719860	And lastly, we have some key clues on a September 19, 1947 memo from Hillencoder to Joint
719860	725460	Intelligence Committee. This majestic document memo allegedly dated just before Bush and
725460	731460	Forestall's request to create MJ-12 is titled, quote, Memorandum for the Military Assessment
731460	738660	of the Joint Intelligence Committee, end quote, aka MAGIC. The memo requests a classified intelligence
738660	745700	project, quote, we recovered one craft, captured one, end quote. This memo states no clear coordinated
745700	752340	scientific examination was possible until, quote, we got a clear directive from the president.
752340	758020	The memo also states Wright Field had a new biological laboratory, the Joint Research
758020	764660	and Development Board, and the FBI, MI5 and MI6 were helping with the effort. And finally,
764660	772580	guys, back to Mr. Wood. The other one that's really big is the Special Operations Manual,
772660	778820	Extraterrestrial Antities Technology Recovery and Disposal. And that was leaked in 1994
779780	785860	to Don Berliner, who was an aviation week and space reporter in Washington, D.C.
787620	797140	And it was an undeveloped film. I came in a little green box and they went and my father and I and,
797140	803380	well, not me, but my father and Don went to the dark room and developed it and got all the
804500	816900	original images. I'll just pull a couple sheets out just for fun to show you. This is,
817860	826580	you know, came in an echo binder along the edge over here and also became with the Change Control
826580	835380	page, which is difficult to see, but it says Kirkland Air Force Base Unit KB-88 Building 21,
835380	844740	Kirkland Air Force Base, N.M.X. We found that there was a Building 21, I think it's now called
844740	853620	Building 40, back then. And the fact that the abbreviation for the stamp, Kirkland Air Force
853620	867380	Base, N.M.X, is the correct postal abbreviation for 1954 for New Mexico. If it said NM, that would
867380	875060	have been a hallmark of fakery or an anachronism that would be worthy of lots of investigation.
875620	879620	Mr. Wood and myself will speak on the Special Operations Manual throughout this video,
879700	885300	so we will only go into brief detail here. The manual according to Ryan Wood, Dr. Robert Wood,
885300	890420	and Stanton Friedman is equally, if not more authentic than the Eisenhower Briefing Document.
891060	896980	Friedman has even stated, quote, the Majestic 12 documents problem is complex and extensive.
896980	904580	On balance, it appears that the EBD, TFM, and CTM are almost certainly genuine. The SOM-101
905380	911620	likely genuine, end quote. Debate has raged on for decades now, if the document is a hoax,
911620	918020	real, or possibly Soviet disinformation. Later in the interview, we will do an entire analysis
918020	923700	into the Special Operations Manual, or the SOM-101 as I'll refer to it. But for now,
923700	930180	understand this manual, allegedly written in 1954 and initially housed in Kirkland Air Force Base,
930180	934580	serves as a comprehensive summary of majestic operations for quote unquote,
934580	941140	Majestic 12 units, and quote unquote, authorized personnel. The manual contains everything from
941140	947780	MJ-12 full operational capacity and modus operandi, NHI craft and body descriptions,
947780	954340	to MJ-12 recovery and disinformation protocols. Similar to his masterpiece, Magic Eyes Only,
954340	959940	Ryan Wood has attributed a weighted authenticity rating to every document based on factors such
959940	966980	as direct firsthand witnesses, forensic analysis if possible, document source, etc. The Special
966980	971860	Operations Manual and Eisenhower Briefing Document are two of the few pieces Wood has
971860	977620	rated with the highest level of authenticity. But are there others with such high confidence?
977620	985060	But I would also add the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit document, because the governments acknowledged
985060	991140	the existence of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, part of the Stephen J. Chamberlain Assistant
991140	997540	Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Technical and Scientific Directorate, Counterintelligence Group,
997540	1006340	IPU Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit. You know, all these hierarchies down in the, you know, 40s
1007300	1014020	time frame. Well, this was 47 where the IPU document. But what's interesting about the IPU
1014020	1020820	document, which is on majesticdocuments.com, people can read it. And in my book, Magic Eyes Only,
1022100	1028980	is details about the Roswell crash, you know, when it crashed at 2332 Mountain Standard Time and
1028980	1040900	dropped off radar. And it had discussions of body parts inside the craft in the handwritten notes.
1041460	1053140	And it had discussions of autopsies of the aliens done by Dietliff Bronk and Charles Ethan Ray,
1053780	1060500	which, you know, when I started to look around, I said, who's who's Charles Ethan Ray? And he was a
1061060	1068820	medical core expert with Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project. And
1069780	1077620	and I called up his daughter in Seattle and said, you know, do you think your father could have
1077620	1084500	autopsied an alien? And she didn't hesitate at all and said, yes, not that she knew that he did it,
1084500	1091300	but it's clear in her mind that, oh, absolutely, this is the sort of stuff he would have been tapped to do.
1092260	1099220	So I mean, there, there's just more and more details, stories about the IPU and that document.
1099220	1108740	And so those three, I mean, each one has its own basket of interesting facts and authenticity.
1108740	1113780	Viewers of this channel will know recently, I have been discussing the Interplanetary
1113780	1119300	Phenomenon Unit, the US Army's in-house unofficial department in the 50s for an
1119380	1126580	assistant chief of staff for intelligence to study UFOs. The IPU initially discovered through
1126580	1133300	FOIA requests after initial DoD denial exists only through quote unquote institutional memory.
1133860	1139460	I highly recommend reading Anthony Bergoglia's piece on the IPU. The existence of this division
1139460	1145860	was first revealed on September 6, 1980, in a FOIA request by Richard Hall and later confirmed in a
1145860	1153220	1984 FOIA request by UFO researcher William Steinman. It took until the 1990s for the USG
1153220	1158980	to state all records were destroyed. Even though Hall's 1980 request oversaw the Army Director
1158980	1165060	of Counterintelligence state all IPU records were surrendered to Blue Book. Anyways, as Ryan stated
1165060	1170180	on MajesticDocuments.com, we can find two IPU documents within the MJ-12 documents,
1170660	1178020	IPU Field Order and IPU Report. The Interplanetary Phenomenon Field Order lists a July 4, 1947
1178020	1183060	correspondence of a situation occurring the day before the memo requesting personnel including
1183060	1188820	an aeronautical engineer and medical doctor cleared for quote need to know end quote.
1188820	1194020	And this date should ring a bell as occurring right before the Roswell crash. The IPU report
1194020	1200820	first made its way into the public on July 16, 1995 and lists astonishing information authorized by
1200820	1207380	Lieutenant General John A. Samford and approved by CIA Director Alan Dolis. Some of you may remember
1207380	1213860	Samford giving the famous press conference alongside Roswell General Roger Raimi post the 1952 UFOs
1213860	1219940	over Washington DC incident. This document explores in great detail the events of the Roswell UFO
1220420	1224740	including initial tracking and assessment of the two sites of the crash to disk.
1225460	1231060	A very key clue in this document is the mention that some Roswell Army airfield investigators at
1231060	1236980	LZ-1, the debris field seen by Brazel and Marcel, thought the wreckage may have been a project mogul
1236980	1242180	balloon until Los Alamos personnel determined the wreckage was something quote unquote out of this
1242180	1246900	world. If you know anything about the Roswell crash, you'll know it's often explained away
1246900	1252420	as a project mogul balloon. And this was revealed after the initial weather balloon cover story in
1252420	1258500	the U.S. Air Force's 1994 report, The Roswell Report. The Roswell Report states the mogul flight
1258500	1264500	that was misidentified as a large metallic flying saucer with bodies was mogul flight number four
1264500	1271620	which allegedly launched on June 4, 1947. However, in 2024 project mogul's field operations director
1271620	1277220	Dr. Alan Crary revealed with evidence flight number four never took place on this day and was
1277220	1282900	indeed canceled due to weather. Anyways, the IP report states a radio biological team and
1282900	1289060	security detail from Sandia National Labs were summoned by Colonel S.B. Housebrook. Chosen
1289060	1295700	scientists consisted of AEC personnel including J. Robert Oppenheimer, Werner von Braun and others.
1295700	1300740	And before you say this sounds too fantastical, remember von Braun's mentor Herman Osberth
1300740	1306180	performed serious analysis on UFO flight characteristics. Twining Vandenberg and others
1306180	1310660	are named within this report as aiding in the recovery effort and overall operation.
1310660	1315460	And an interesting line here, quote, it has become known to CIC that some of the recovery
1315460	1321140	operation was shared with Representative John F. Kennedy, end quote. I'm not going to spend
1321140	1326740	too much more time on the IPU report, but as Wood stated, Detlef Bronk is named as assisting in the
1326740	1333060	autopsy. The report then discusses the NHI bodies, body parts seemingly dissected similar to a frog
1333060	1338020	scattered at the primary crash site and the death of multiple Sandia lab techs due to a form of
1338020	1344420	contamination. And I recently discussed this contamination in my 1974 Koyama Mexico crash
1344420	1349620	retrieval case. Based on the documents, Ryan Wood has the most confidence are in fact legitimate.
1349620	1355780	I asked him to describe robustly what exactly compromises the Majestic 12, how various named
1355780	1360740	members fit into the group and the impact such an organization had on ufology at the
1360740	1369860	time of the initial MJ 12 documents being leaked. Well, it's a top secret research and development
1369860	1377220	intelligence gathering organization that was formed by executive order the president in September
1377220	1386660	24, 1947. You know, 1947 was when the atomic energy act was created when the CIA was created
1386660	1394260	and sort of the OSS was transitioned office of strategic services, which was the CIA at the time
1394260	1399940	into the CIA. And, and they formed this top secret research and development intelligence
1399940	1405300	gathering organization. And it was, you know, headed by Vannevar Bush, part of the
1407060	1412580	Office of Research and Development, OSRD. And this is where
1414740	1420900	Eric Walker, Dr. Eric Walker lived working for Vannevar Bush and ultimately took over
1420980	1430820	the organization and was widely understood to be familiar with MJ 12 while leading it
1431620	1439940	in that group. So the names of the people caught a lot of attention and Stan did a lot of work
1439940	1446260	and has written his book, Top Secret Magic, I think, which highlights a lot of the research
1446260	1454420	around the various people. He dug into Carl Sagan, which was a person that shouldn't have been on
1454420	1462900	the list sort of, you know, he was a big debunker. And, but when Stan finally went to the various
1462900	1470260	archives and dug around, he found lots of correspondence between other MJ 12 members.
1470900	1483220	And, and so that was, you know, interesting and, and powerful for the authenticity of the document.
1483220	1488500	But it was again, it was a photocopy. Well, actually it was filmed. It was, it was undeveloped film,
1488500	1495700	just like the special operations manual that arrived. It might have been from the same source,
1495700	1501460	but it certainly wasn't mailed the same way. Pay close attention here to the name of Dr. Eric
1501460	1506980	A. Walker. In my video on physicist Robert Sarbakar, I discussed how Dr. Sarbakar directly
1506980	1512900	named Vannevar Bush as a key figure studying UFOs within the US government. During conversations
1512900	1518100	with Stanton Friedman, Dr. Sarbakar, who was a member of Bush's Research and Development Board,
1518100	1524340	mentioned Dr. Eric A. Walker as a key figure connected to UFO crash retrievals. Walker was
1524340	1529780	contacted by researcher William Steinman and not only confirmed the existence of the Majestic 12,
1529780	1535300	but actually admitted his own presence at the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania crash retrieval.
1535300	1540340	I highly recommend revisiting my video here. So, I mean, going to the special operations manual
1540340	1546340	that you mentioned with the Ray Z, there's so many hallmarks of authenticity in that particular
1546340	1553380	document. I could start with the fact that we took it to a retired government printing
1553380	1566820	officer general, not general, but MacArthur in Washington, DC. He retired from the US
1566820	1574900	government printing office maybe like six months before we visited him and we went to his house
1574900	1580500	and set it up on a card table and slid the document across and he looked at it and said,
1580500	1584820	well, you know, by the title, Extraterrestrial Entities Technology Recovery Disposal, I would
1584820	1590820	think it's fake. But then he flipped through the documents and saw the disease were raised and said,
1590820	1595700	oh, this is an artifact of hot lead printing press, besides the fact that he checked it for
1595700	1604180	everything. I mean, he said the fonts are right. The indentations are correct. The use of M-dashes
1605060	1616820	in MJ-12 long-dash clearance is correct. The capitalization of first aid was correct for the
1616820	1624020	period. So, he went through a bunch of subtleties that we didn't understand or perceive at the time
1625380	1631540	to highlight the fact that it was real in his mind and ultimately concluded that, yeah,
1631540	1641300	the CIA probably printed it in a cage down on 10th Street. That was his opinion at the time.
1641300	1646260	With Mr. Wood passionately discussing his authentication methods of the MJ-12 Special
1646260	1651860	Operations Manual, now is the perfect time to discuss the contents of this absolutely mind-boggling
1651860	1658900	document. Psalm 1 was sent anonymously to Don Berliner in 1994 and consisted of undeveloped 35
1658900	1665620	millimeter triax film authenticated to 1954. Labeled top secret magic eyes only, the manual
1665620	1671780	details the full operational capacity and mission of the Majestic 12. As mentioned by Mr. Wood,
1671780	1676500	we see the document control is regressed to a singular stamp of Kirtland Air Force Base, New
1676500	1684820	Mexico. The document control page shows us MJ-12 members, MJ-01 and MJ-04, who altered the document
1684820	1693220	from 1954 to 1958. Initials listed here are EWL and JRT. Two names Ryan has actually tracked and
1693220	1698420	we will discuss shortly. And now we get into the meat of this document. Quote, this manual has been
1698420	1704420	prepared especially for Majestic 12 units, end quote. Its purpose is to present all aspects of
1704420	1710260	MJ-12, so authorized personnel will have a better understanding of the goals of the group, be able
1710260	1716660	to more expertly deal with UFOs, ET tech and entities and increase the efficiency of future
1716660	1721940	operations. Section one, project goals and purposes of this document make some startling
1721940	1728740	revelations. One, MJ-12 considers unidentified flying objects UFO bees to be a matter of the
1728740	1734660	very highest order of national security. Two, there would be a negative impact on the public with
1734740	1740900	general knowledge of the UFO situation. Three, danger present if advanced tech falls into the
1740900	1748020	hands of adversaries. And four, MJ-12 was established on the 24th of September 1947
1748020	1754500	under recommendation by Vannevar Bush and Forestall. The goals of MJ-12 are clearly outlined here as
1754500	1760260	well. One, recovery for scientific study of all materials and devices of foreign or ET
1760340	1766980	manufacture. Recovery by any and all means by group. This immediately reminds me of the 1974
1766980	1772500	Koyama case with the American retrieval team finding the craft in Mexico at all costs.
1772500	1778740	Two, recovery for study of all entities and remains of entities of non-terrestrial origin
1778740	1783540	through independent action by those entities or by misfortune or military action.
1783940	1788180	Well, naturally, when you recover something that's either landed or crashed,
1789620	1796260	sometimes you encounter dead pilots. And believe it or not, as fantastical as that sounds,
1797700	1803060	it's true. Three, establishment and administration of special teams to accomplish the above
1803060	1807780	operations, which reminds me for the third video in a row of Christopher Sharpe's article on the
1807780	1814580	CIA, OGA and JSOC being behind crash retrieval operations. Four, establishment and admin of
1814580	1820580	special secure facilities located at secret locations within USA for providing receiving,
1820580	1827380	processing, analysis and study of any and all materials and entities classified as extraterrestrial.
1827380	1833620	Five, covert operations carried in collusion with the CIA both home and abroad. And six,
1833620	1839780	establishment and absolute secrecy of all operations. As of the time of the alleged creation
1839780	1846420	of this document in 1954, MJ-12 does not consider NHI to be a threat, consisting of a benign presence
1846420	1852100	but with technology far beyond human science. The group had in possession several recovered
1852100	1858020	dead biologics. Section one general begins to define the scope of the majestic 12,
1858020	1864820	determination, documentation, collection and disposition of debris, devices, craft and occupants.
1864820	1870020	This section defines ET technology as aircraft not manufactured by human power,
1870660	1875620	objects that appear as one of several shapes and configurations and exhibit extraordinary
1875620	1881460	flight characteristics, consisting of materials exhibiting characteristics beyond science.
1881460	1888260	And this section even describes EBEs, creatures humanoid or otherwise whose evolutionary process
1888260	1894660	differs demonstrably from that of Homo sapiens. And now we get to my favorite part of this entire
1894660	1901060	document, the description of the craft. Elliptical or disc shaped craft appear to be metallic and
1901060	1906340	dull in color, whose appearance consists of two pie pans or shallow dishes pressed together.
1906340	1912260	Psalm 101 even lists some dimensions of these craft, they are 50 to 300 feet in diameter,
1912260	1917700	with their thickness near 15% of the total diameter. A dome extends above the disc,
1917700	1924340	about 30% of the disc diameter and extends four to six feet above the main body. This dome may or
1924340	1930900	may not include windows or ports. Lights on the craft exist on the top, bottom and rim that only
1930900	1937220	function during operation. There's no antenna or projections, but there are three extendable
1937220	1944660	sets of landing gear. Cigar shape or tic-tacs are considered very rare. They can be 2000 feet long
1944660	1952020	and 95 feet thick. They do not operate in lower atmosphere and travel at excess of 7k miles per
1952020	1958500	hour. They do not engage in the rapid erratic or instantaneous maneuvers the smaller craft do.
1958500	1963860	The ovoid circular or teardrop shapes look almost like an ice cream cone, round at the
1963860	1969220	large end and tapering to a near point at the other. They are 30 to 40 feet long and have a
1969220	1974340	diameter 20% of the length. The craft have a bright light at the end point and the craft
1974340	1980180	travels pointing down. And lastly we have the airfoil or triangular shape. These were considered
1980180	1986020	new tech due to rarity of recent observations. The craft appear to be an isosceles triangle
1986020	1991220	with their longest side being near 300 feet length. Little was known about the performance
1991220	1998260	capabilities, but they operated apparently similar to the disc or ovoid shape. SOM101 then begins to
1998260	2004100	go into description of extraterrestrial biological entities listing a type 1 and type 2 and thank
2004100	2010500	you to Bill McDonald for the art here. EBE1's luck humanoid, they are 5 to 5 feet 4 inches tall,
2010500	2016660	weighing 80 to 100 pounds. They have larger, more rounded craniums with chalky yellow,
2016660	2023300	thick, slightly pebbled pale skin. They have small eyes, white set that are almost almond shape,
2023300	2028820	with brownish black irises and very large pupils and gray whites. Their mouths are
2028820	2035780	wide, nearly lipless. They have fine hair, not confined to underarm and groin. Their body is
2035780	2043540	thin with no fat and good muscles. EBE1 has small hands, four long digits, no thumb, but webbing.
2044260	2049620	The description of the type 2 EBE will remind you as much more of a classic gray. They are
2049620	2056420	humanoid, but 3 feet 5 inches to 4 feet 2 inches tall, weighing 25 to 50 pounds. Their large,
2056420	2062820	elongated head is larger proportionally to that of a human or EBE1. Their eyes are large, slanted,
2062820	2069060	and nearly wrap around their head, showing only pure black. The nose appears to be two small slits
2069060	2074820	above a slit like mouth with no external ears. Their skin is pale blue grayish, fine-celled,
2074820	2080020	and smooth. They have no hair, leading MJ12 to believe these creatures are not mammalian.
2080580	2086820	Their hands have three long fingers plus a long thumb. They have four toes jointed with a membrane.
2086820	2091540	The document then gives astounding descriptions of extraterrestrial technology, recovered from
2091540	2097620	crash sites from 1947 to 1953. This date range includes Roswell to Kingman.
2098180	2103300	Metallurgical analyses show the materials were not known to terrestrial science at the time.
2103300	2107860	The material showed incredible strength and extreme resistance in proportion to weight
2107860	2111780	and size, appearing similar to aluminum foil or aluminum magnesium sheeting.
2112340	2117460	Identical to the claims of primary Roswell witness Jesse Marcel Sr. down to the inclusion of
2117460	2123380	inscriptions on material. In the press blackout section, we find information extremely pertinent
2123380	2129700	to today's age. Media denial, discrediting witnesses, deceptive statements. There are countless
2129700	2134660	examples I can discuss here, but I recommend watching my UFO stigma video and paying key
2134660	2139620	attention to the Robertson panel and Condon committee, and also look at the reprisals against
2139620	2145300	David Grush. Secure the area, removal and transport, and cleaning the area all detail systems and
2145300	2150100	protocol for crash retrieval. What is of extreme interest here is the specific mention that any
2150100	2155940	specific craft or device that appears to be functional is designated to red team. I can't
2155940	2160260	help but think back to RA and how one piece of technology he observed at the off world
2160260	2165940	technologies division was designated a weapon during recovery due to an energetic discharge.
2165940	2169380	But I asked Mr. Wood if he had ever come across this red team before.
2170260	2178660	I have to look, but I mean, I recall blue, blue fly and blue teams as well. I mean,
2178660	2186100	I think the term red team and blue team are the same teams, so to speak, in crash retrievals.
2186100	2195300	But, you know, right in the front description of the special operations manual, they have
2196260	2204100	they mentioned these MJ 12 recovery teams. And I think in the,
2206820	2210900	well, you know, at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, they call it the blue lab.
2211460	2216980	Now onto section 16. Special or unusual conditions has a very interesting note here.
2216980	2221460	Should the need for public disclosure become necessary, the majestic team was to issue
2221460	2228820	contingency plan mj-1949-04p-78. Remember this from the Eisenhower briefing document?
2229380	2236020	We don't have the contingency plan. It's interesting that in the back of the special
2236020	2245940	operations manual, there's a series of references in the back and they weren't supplied.
2245940	2250420	That's the missing appendix too, right? Yeah, that's the missing appendix for references.
2250420	2261060	I mean, it's in the back here. But for example, the photographic references were all correct,
2261060	2266020	and you can go find them. So they're correctly referenced in the back.
2267940	2276740	And then there's also the another sort of authenticity point is the UFOB,
2276740	2286980	unidentified flying object, object identification guide that is listed in the manual, but was not
2286980	2296980	supplied as photocopies, original photocopies, but other FOIA documents provided a typed version
2296980	2304260	of it, not type set, but just typed. But when my father re-typed it all, following the format of
2304260	2312580	the manual, it perfectly matched the page numbers in the table of contents and fit like a glove right
2312580	2318660	in there. Section 17, extraterrestrial classification table is truly consequential for
2318660	2325220	analyzing this document. Intact craft, damaged devices, identified and unidentified fragments
2325220	2332500	and weapons were all to go to Area 51 S4. If you say Area 51 wasn't built in 1954,
2332500	2338180	we'll discuss this shortly. Media, electronic recordings, maps, charts, etc. were to go to
2338180	2344340	Kirtland Air Force Base Building 21. Supplies and provisions as well as deceased entities
2344340	2349780	were to be sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Blue Room. If Blue Room rings a bell besides
2349780	2355700	Mr. Wood just commenting on it, remember in my UFO whistleblowers video, Senator Harry Goldwater was
2355700	2360820	denied access to the contents of the Wright-Patterson Blue Room by General Curtis LeMay.
2362820	2371140	I think the government does know. I can't back that up, but I think that at Wright-Patterson
2371140	2377460	Field, if you could get into certain places, you'd find out what the Air Force and the government
2377460	2387620	knows about UFOs. Reportedly, a spaceship landed and was all hushed up, quieted and nobody ever
2388260	2397380	have never heard about much of it. I called Curtis LeMay and I said, General, I know we have a room
2398180	2405300	at Wright-Patterson where you put all his secret stuff. Can I go in there?
2406260	2415700	I've never heard him get mad, but he got mad at me, cussed me out, said don't ever ask me that question again.
2415700	2425540	And speaking of General Curtis LeMay, and we have we have a accommodation from Curtis LeMay to
2426260	2433140	Harry B. Cooper, which is the father of Tim Cooper, where many of these majestic documents came,
2433220	2444260	and for his outstanding work at the USAF UFO program. So I mean, I can supply you that
2444260	2450420	document. You can put it up on the screen. Let me see it. So that's another example of,
2452580	2461860	you know, why in the world would Curtis LeMay sign accommodation for somebody for their USAF
2462740	2470500	program? It just makes no sense that it's not totally real. I'm just trying to find
2470500	2476980	a copy of it quickly. Yeah, I mean, it's it's hard to hard to read here. But, you know, this is
2478740	2486100	this is their seal and accommodation. And it's to Harry B. Cooper, master sergeant,
2486180	2491860	distinguished himself by Meritorious Service as a non-commissioned officer in charge of printing
2491860	2497460	management branch and non-commissioned officer in charge of camera section, publishing division,
2498340	2503540	command directorate of administration of services, headquarters, air defense command,
2503540	2513620	int Air Force Base, Colorado from 30 September 57 to one June 63. So he was in air force base
2513620	2523460	between 57 and 63 looking at photographs of UFOs and printing all sorts of classified documents.
2525620	2536980	And, you know, I think it's Harry's relationship to this UFO topic and the friends that he made
2536980	2549620	during that time that allowed those friends to decide that I want to give stuff to Harry's son,
2549620	2557540	Tim Cooper, and several of the mailbox drops that had a lot of these documents from
2558260	2566260	ostensibly the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Officer or Moondust Officer came from.
2566260	2573060	Back to section 17, living entities were to be directed solely to OPNAC BBS 01. Of course,
2573060	2578340	OPNAV, not OPNAC, stands for the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. There are some who
2578340	2583140	guess this acronym stands for the Oceanic Platform for the North Atlantic and Caribbean,
2583140	2588340	and that BBS stands for the Bermuda Biological Station now called BIOS, the Bermuda Institute
2588340	2594900	of Oceanic Sciences, but there's really no proof here. SOM101 continues with packaging and shipping
2594980	2601300	protocols for EBE life and states, quote, loss of EBE life is acceptable, and also details in
2601300	2606900	figure for the extraterrestrial craft referenced earlier in the document. Here we observe classic
2606900	2612980	saucer and triangle shapes, but also the conical shape, which closely resembles the 1976 Tehran
2612980	2619380	Iran UFO case and the Cash Landrum case. You know, in 54, now they have the triangle shape,
2619380	2624740	they have the ice cream cone shape, they got the cigar shape, the typical saucer shape,
2625940	2634740	but I draw your attention to the triangles and the ice cream cone, which is, you know,
2634740	2642580	famous for the Cash Landrum case, and triangles are, this is some of the earliest mentions of
2642580	2647780	flying triangles. But anyways, let's circle back to the document control page and analyze the
2647780	2656020	initials, EWL and JRT. Inside the control page, which is typical of every highly classified
2656580	2662580	document, this was apparently two points above top secret, according to the document,
2662580	2667060	classifications are different now, and it's pretty much, I believe, an Air Force document.
2667140	2677220	So, I went to the Albuquerque phone book, pulled it up for 1954, 55, 56, I mean,
2677220	2684580	the entries in the change control page span from 54 to 57, I believe,
2686340	2692020	and they had the initials. And so, I looked in the phone book and found all the initials, and there
2692020	2704340	were two people that Jess R. Totten and Captain Lewis, I think, they both lived on Perimeter Road,
2704340	2711620	like four or five houses from each other, inside Kirkland Air Force Base, at the right time. And
2712100	2722340	then, that's in the authenticity discussions of, on the specialoperationsmanual.com website,
2722340	2732580	it's in my book, and I'm working on a new updated pamphlet that will have the whole manual and all
2732580	2740900	the authenticity discussion that people can read just easily. So, I found them, and then I hired a
2740900	2753060	private investigator to go find them. And, well, I actually found one guy, one J.R.T., but he said,
2753060	2758340	he's not the right guy, despite being there at the right time.
2758340	2762020	And he was the one who lived on the street near kind of what you found from the phone
2762020	2768980	book at the time near Kirkland, correct? Well, I didn't go to, so the process is really to go to
2768980	2780500	the Adjutant General's listing in government document libraries to find their name and serial
2780500	2785060	number, and when you get the serial number, you can get their National Personnel Record Center
2785060	2795540	files, and then you can start digging around and try to find these people. And I found one J.R.T.,
2795540	2800020	which I thought was the right person, and went to his house. He took the meeting,
2800020	2807300	I was surprised, and pulled out a FedEx envelope with this thing, you know, I'm sure he probably
2807300	2813060	thought I was from the CIA or something, and opened it up, handed it to him, and said,
2813060	2822260	is this you? And he looked at it for a while and looked at the initials and said, no, well,
2822260	2827060	I asked him, well, what did you do at Kirkland Air Force Base? And that time, well, I was,
2827060	2834820	I was sort of a psychological counselor or officer. I mean, you basically sort of hemmed and
2834820	2846420	hawed about what he did. But nevertheless, the other private investigator found the kids of EWL,
2847140	2852260	or the, I think it was the, I have to look at my notes, but wife or daughter, I think was the wife.
2854020	2858660	And apparently he had passed away, was buried, I think he was buried in Florida.
2859860	2871620	We have a grave marker. And we got platitudes. But, you know, what you hire private investigators,
2871700	2877460	they're, they can do things that I just find very uncomfortable. They'll just lie to your
2877460	2883220	face all the time. They'll lead you on. They'll, they'll, they'll squeeze information on all these
2883220	2892980	methods that, you know, I just don't have the skills to do. And so I found that very interesting
2892980	2899140	process. So we did our best to find that. But I would say the smoking gun there is that, yay,
2900100	2906180	two initials are correct. And they were on the base perimeter road, you know, addresses.
2907860	2913620	And that was just like, whoa, boy, that's a really good hallmark for authenticity
2914740	2923700	that it was real. And, you know, I know you mentioned John Alexander in his comments.
2924260	2926340	Maybe you want to set that up and I'll respond.
2926980	2931940	Some of you may be familiar with Colonel John B. Alexander, a former U.S. Army Colonel whose name
2931940	2936580	has been deeply entwined with ufology and government psionic programs like remote viewing.
2937220	2941300	Not only has Alexander made some outward comments on the MJ12.
2941300	2948180	Okay, we haven't got time to cover all that. MJ12 was real, had absolutely nothing to do with UFOs.
2948180	2953700	And if you understand what it was designed for, it was the right kind of people, you don't have
2953780	2959780	to make explanations as how certain people got in. But the people who did know, I mean, I was,
2961060	2968900	in fact, what the thing was, at one time I had got rumors of the program. And it was one time that
2968900	2974660	I went to Stubblebine and said, what about this thing? And he says, we're not going to discuss that.
2974660	2980020	And it was a super, super secret and parts of it still are and need to stay that way.
2980580	2987060	In his book, UFOs, Myths, Conspiracies and Reality, Alexander claimed Dr. Bob Wood told Alexander he
2987060	2993940	believed the Psalm 101 manual to have been created in 1954 with the expressed intention to be leaked
2993940	2999300	to Soviet spies as part of a disinformation campaign. The intent would be to get the Soviets to
2999300	3003780	commit resources to UAP crash recoveries. Well, what does Ryan have to say?
3004260	3011860	Yeah, I mean, I wish I knew what he's up to. I guess I've known John for many, many years.
3012500	3020340	And so is my father. And he's always wanted to push the envelope and try to squeeze information
3020340	3030340	out of people or trade information. So he has, I mean, he was in Vietnam, he was a special forces
3030980	3039460	colonel operating in Cambodia illegally, you know, maybe on orders, maybe not. So he's had a long
3039460	3051380	history of trying to skirt the edge of legitimacy, in my opinion. And, you know, why did he say this,
3051380	3058820	that it's Russian Soviet, you know, spy craft? I think it was to curry favor with somebody else.
3060340	3067700	Because it just makes no sense. I mean, there's why would you expose the fact that you've got alien
3067700	3073780	technology that is going to write Patterson Air Force Base and Air 51S4 and you got bodies and
3073780	3081300	parts and a whole retrieval program. And why do so much and then leak it? Why wouldn't you just,
3081300	3092900	you know, you could put it with one of your assets in the Soviet Union and leak it in a much more
3094740	3102500	responsible, less visible way. And so from a psychological warfare point of view,
3103380	3112500	or PSYOP, it just, it doesn't work. It's like you're exposing too much information,
3112500	3122100	there's no need to create such a fancy document with such high credibility to try to scare the
3122100	3129060	Soviets. They have their own crashes. No ETs are real. I mean, or China, they
3129060	3137940	they penetrated the Manhattan Project, you know, within a year to get the atomic bomb.
3137940	3146260	And I'm sure that they were right on top of the whole, you know, UFO crash UFO thing. So
3146260	3154260	it doesn't really make much sense in my mind. And the same thing is true with the entire swath
3154260	3162340	of majestic documents. Is it why in the world would you try to do something over 19 years with
3162340	3170820	so many documents of so many different different quality aspects? Some are really just photocopies,
3170820	3179300	other original documents. So it just if you're trying to scare the living daylights out of some,
3180260	3187700	you know, foreign intelligence agency, it's probably better to do something else.
3187700	3192260	With all this talk of the Psalm 101, let's spend some time authenticating the document
3192260	3197300	and spend some time analyzing arguments against the document. Now there is a witness,
3197300	3203220	Navy Yeoman Dale Bailey, who alleges he saw the Psalm 101 manual when he was assisting in the
3203300	3209540	destruction of classified UFO material for an admiral in 1976. Mr. Wood is currently in the
3209540	3214580	process of locating files on this witness from his father's archive, so I may have some testimony
3214580	3219700	from this individual soon. Within the words of the document, the woods have noticed many minute
3219700	3224660	details that speak to the manual's authenticity. These include the mention of craft tape when
3224660	3230900	discussing packaging NHI materials, not duct tape, which is accurate to 1954 shipping methods,
3231460	3235860	as well as some spelling mechanisms, such as screwdriver being two words,
3235860	3242340	which was customary in 1954, the capitalization of first aid, which was changed to lower case in
3242340	3251620	the late fifties, the abbreviation of New Mexico as n.mex, not n.m, which was altered for zip codes,
3251620	3256980	as well as the solo typo in the document in the word desiccant. And there is, of course,
3257060	3261860	the point we touched on earlier, the raising of the letter Z, which indicated the usage of a hot
3261860	3267300	lead press. Many detractors to the document like to point to the cover page and usage of variable
3267300	3272580	fonts and drop shadow font, but we can find other Army field manuals from this time period
3272580	3278820	using the same styling. Odd fonts had also been used in various documents, like this October 24,
3278820	3285460	1952 memo initiating the NSA under the Truman administration. Blocked epistemology has theorized
3285460	3291060	the usage of fonts was actually experiments done by Dr. Vannevar Bush, who actually experimented
3291060	3295620	with fonts, such as pictured here in a popular mechanics magazine, where we can see Bush operating
3295620	3302420	a novel photo type setting machine out of EGNG in 1950. Bush even led the design of the cryptographic
3302420	3309060	machinery used by the NSA's predecessor, OP20-G. Skeptics of the memo additionally like to point
3309060	3313700	out a restricted classification on the memo's cover page and how the memo cannot be both top
3313700	3319380	secret and restricted since restricted classification falls below confidential and top secret.
3319380	3325300	This is a misunderstood point. According to the 1947 Atomic Energy Act, information on atomic
3325300	3331940	energy is born classified, even if not created by USG elements. In situations such as these,
3331940	3337620	restricted data is not a level of classification. A document containing restricted data can also
3337620	3343460	be classified as secret or top secret. The Psalm 1 was also written during the time that
3343460	3349300	the restricted classification level was phased out of USG to confidential. So we can find articles
3349300	3354980	during this time about an extended changeover period due to some issues. Additionally, skeptics
3354980	3360420	point out the fact that Area 51 S4, as highlighted in the classification table, did not exist in
3360420	3370260	1954. And this is a very important point to address. Yeah, well, and we found a newspaper
3370260	3379780	article in 51 basically contractors are pissed off that there was this huge government contract
3379780	3389860	awarded to a competitor for hundreds of millions of dollars for concrete out in Area 51. And they're
3389860	3398020	fighting back and forth in the newspaper in 51. And the other thing is it was Groom Lake. There was
3398020	3407220	a mine, the Groom Lake mine, which was a borax mine there already, that could have been exploited
3407860	3415140	to be enhanced for an underground facility as well. That could still be researched further
3416100	3423140	to find out from the mining department and the historical records. Well, how big was this
3423140	3430020	underground borax mine? How many millions of square feet is it or was it? Where precisely is it?
3430900	3441380	So you could dig further to provide further evidence there. But yeah, clearly, it was started in 51.
3442260	3450980	And it's I'm sure started small. I strongly recommend reading Jan Aldrich's 1996 criticism
3450980	3456340	of the Special Operations Manual. Aldrich's primary criticisms of the manual revolve around what it
3456340	3461220	doesn't include, such as instructions to tell recovery teams to set up a grid, photograph the
3461220	3467460	scene and tag each item for future reference. Aldrich also criticizes the use of downed satellites,
3467460	3473060	which in 1954 was before the time of Sputnik. The use of the word satellite has been utilized
3473060	3478180	commonly during this time period in literature to discuss space debris. I find much of his
3478180	3483380	criticisms to be fluff, such as problems with interchanging the phrases MJ12, Magic 12, and
3483380	3487780	Majestic 12 throughout the document, and can't help but to feel that Aldrich cherry picked his
3487780	3493620	argument surrounding what is not instructed of the recovery teams. However, I do think his criticisms
3493620	3498180	are important to understand when reading the document. If you want to read more, Ryan and
3498180	3503220	Dr. Bob have a massive section on their website, specialoperationsmanual.com,
3503220	3508740	authenticating the Psalm 101. I highly recommend reading this for a more of a deep dive into
3508740	3512980	authenticating the manual. The article explores more into the provenance of the document,
3512980	3517620	including analyzing the anonymous store in Wisconsin where the film was mailed.
3517620	3521940	With all of this discussion around the Psalm 101, I found it important to touch on the
3521940	3525780	legitimacy of other majestic documents, especially those that have been found in
3525780	3531460	avenues such as the National Archives. Ryan had many more to reference. There was the Cutler
3531460	3541620	Twining Memo. This is Bob Cutler, Robert Cutler to the National Security Council, and it says
3542180	3552100	M.J.12 Special Studies Group in 1954. It doesn't say majestic, but it says
3552100	3559860	M.J.12 Special Studies Group. It's the original Onion Skin. It's in the Library of Congress
3559860	3570420	Manuscript Division in downtown Washington. There's other documents, too. There's one at
3570420	3578580	College Park in Maryland from the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, which is part of
3578580	3589300	Paperclip. This says C.I.A. M.J.12 on the bottom of a memo for Project Paperclip,
3590980	3598740	Project 63, I think. Anyway, there's a couple of examples, and then there's acknowledgement,
3599300	3605700	as I mentioned earlier, that the Interplanetary Phenomenon Union exists as well.
3608660	3615140	It's not like there's no evidence from the National Archives, let alone all the other stuff,
3616020	3621540	all the other UFOs, Project Sign, Project Grudge, and all that research.
3622100	3626980	Of course, with Ross Colthart's new Reality Check program, interest in JFK and the majestic
3626980	3631700	documents is at an all-time high, and I was super keen to explore this avenue.
3631700	3636900	I think it's in the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, one where they say that Kennedy
3637780	3646340	was given some information or believed to have gotten information from somebody in Congress
3647620	3656260	while he was before he was elected president. Kennedy was aware of it, according to the
3656260	3666340	documents, of this topic and its importance. There's also National Security Action Memorandums
3667700	3677620	from, like, a week before he's assassinated, where he says to James Webb, the head of NASA,
3679620	3687380	I want you to share with the Russians the knowns and the unknowns. And by implication,
3687380	3695460	that means, you know, open the kimono and tell the Soviets all about UFOs. And there's lots of
3695460	3701220	reasons why Kennedy would be assassinated. But here's another one reason is that you might have
3701780	3709700	told the truth or pushed harder on cooperation with the Soviets. I mean, particularly after his,
3710420	3716900	you know, Bay of Pigs, you know, showdown, you didn't want that to happen again.
3717540	3722900	The connection with JFK and MJ-12 does not stop here. Within the majestic documents lies
3722900	3729380	a re-typed NSA intercept of JFK's hotline talking to the premier about the UFO situation
3729380	3734900	and national security implications. JFK has also mentioned within another set of documents would
3734900	3742340	consider to have the highest authenticity rating, the Burnt Memo. In June of 1999, UFO researcher Tim
3742340	3748420	Cooper received an anonymous letter from a source claiming to be a CIA counterintelligence officer
3748500	3753700	with documents that would connect MJ-12 to JFK's murder. The source commended Cooper on
3753700	3759380	his decision to have worked with Dr. Bob on the majestic files. The files included by the source
3759380	3764980	claim to have been some of the last surviving paper MJ-12 documents after a special classified
3764980	3771220	executive order from Nixon ordered all MJ-12 documents to be destroyed and moved onto computers.
3771220	3775940	The Burnt Memo was allegedly snatched from a fire before being destroyed and is unlike most
3775940	3782980	documents original paper. This memo is from MJ-1, aka the director of central intelligence.
3782980	3788660	The memo is directed to MJ's two through seven in reference to Project Majestic in Jehovah,
3788660	3795460	Aviro, Parasite, and Parheleon. Quote, As you must know, Lancer, codeword for JFK, has made some
3795460	3802100	inquiries regarding our activities which we cannot allow. End quote. We can also find a 1961
3802100	3807940	document allegedly sent by JFK to the director of the CIA requesting an update on the psychological
3807940	3814580	warfare plans related to the Majestic-12. And here is a very interesting additional point. In 2023,
3814580	3820020	President Biden ordered some documents from the JFK investigation be released. One name of note
3820020	3825700	within these documents was CIA agent Reuben Efron, who was intercepting Lee Harvey Oswald
3826180	3832980	months before his assassination. I do find it a bit strange, the October 15, 1955 Central
3832980	3839300	Intelligence Bulletin listed operative Reuben Efron as well as three other USG or US military
3839300	3844580	personnel as witnessing disc-like UFOs when traveling via train in the Caspian Sea.
3845140	3849460	There are hundreds of majestic documents and the woods have implemented a really quality
3849460	3854980	scale to gauge the authenticity of these documents. So of course, with so many documents from so many
3854980	3860660	sources over so many years, I was encouraged to ask Mr. Wood if there were any documents he suspects
3860660	3870740	are forgeries. Yeah, that's a good comment. At this point, I don't have any information that
3870740	3878900	any document that's listed on the website is fake. I have no credible evidence that it's
3878900	3884900	genuinely fake. I mean, so to fake something you have to have really, what's the specific,
3884900	3893620	why did you fake it? Did you launch it against a specific target in intelligence? Are you trying
3893620	3900500	to mess with the UFO community? Why bother? The general attitude of the intelligence community
3900500	3907460	or the people that control this secret is to ignore everything and provide no additional
3907540	3914500	confirmation or evidence. They just try to manage leaks and discredit people. So
3915620	3924100	that's the methodology for managing leaks. So I would say at this time, I have no evidence that
3925300	3929780	anything has been faked. Now, I've got lots of documents where you can't do anything more,
3930660	3938900	like the Aquarius document that came out in the Carter, was allegedly signed by Carter.
3938900	3942340	Yeah, I wanted to bring that up. That was brought forth by UFO researcher Lee Graham,
3942340	3947620	the Aquarius document package. Can you talk about that and describe it a little bit along with
3947620	3956580	kind of your feelings on it? Yeah, I mean, it's sort of fluff in my mind. I mean, it's informed
3956580	3965700	fluff, but there's nothing to check. There's not enough specifics to validate or check anything.
3965700	3977300	And it just seems odd that a document like this would be devoid of specifics. Maybe they wanted
3977300	3985620	to ensure that there weren't any specifics that were checkable. But that's the part that's troubling
3986180	3990900	and you can't check it. So you don't know what to do with it. So that's why it's in
3990900	3997620	that Stan Friedman calls the gray basket or I call the neutral basket where I need more evidence
3997620	4005460	to push it down or up. As we know, the majestic documents were leaked during the 1984 to 1999
4005460	4010660	era. This time was post Robertson panel and Condon committee where public interest in UFOs
4010660	4016260	were at a relative low. Only behind the scenes in the 70s were researchers like Leonard Stringfield
4016260	4021140	doing serious research on crash retrievals. With the majority of the documents dating back to the
4021140	4026980	40s and 50s, I asked Mr. Wood why he thought the leaks occurred when they did. But it was really
4026980	4035300	about Vannevar Bush writing to Eisenhower saying, you know, we have all these celestial gifts
4036100	4042340	of crash UFOs and we really ought to do something about it. And he said, be quiet, go win the war
4042900	4048180	and come back to me later. And when Roswell happened, they actually pushed at it and started
4048180	4056580	this organization. So who leaked it and why? Well, again, there's multiple sources and we don't
4056580	4065540	really know, but we know that there was two film drops in 84 and 94. Those may have been the same
4065540	4073860	people, but maybe not two different people. The certain method of delivery and undeveloped film
4073860	4088100	was the same. And then there was several mailings from Sacramento, California. There was several
4088100	4102100	mailbox drops. Some physically put in Tim Cooper's mailbox without postage. It's like somebody
4102100	4108500	went into the mail room where it was a member of the post office and put it in his mailbox
4108500	4118420	or cracked his code at the top and stuck it in. And then there was some mailings, for example,
4118420	4125140	from the Freedom of Information Act office at Fort Meade, Maryland that became physically mailed,
4125220	4132420	the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers, which is original onion skin. And then there was
4134580	4141620	a couple of different documents that were, they had this dash one and dash two in the upper corner
4141620	4151060	on every page. And ultimately, Thomas Cantwheel wrote a letter at the time of his death or near
4151060	4163300	the time of his death to Tim Cooper. It basically said, here, Tim, by the time you get this letter
4163300	4172740	reaches you, I will left this world. So he's dying of cancer. And he goes on to describe
4173620	4183140	his relationship with Stringfield and Friedman and intelligence contacts at Fort Meade, Maryland,
4184100	4200660	Roswell, and then has a sketch of a craft that he sort of drew as the Roswell craft.
4202820	4212100	And then we also had another letter from Salina, which is allegedly the daughter of
4214340	4219940	Thomas Cantwell or Cantwheel, which is a pseudonym, you know, it's not his real name.
4222420	4230500	So, but he worked allegedly at the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit and probably was an OSS officer
4231140	4239060	in that time frame. And, you know, you don't know what he what he died of other than cancer.
4239060	4252900	But so that's sort of the broad brush of the sources of materials. And there's so many names.
4252900	4258740	I mean, on the majesticdocuments.com website, there's a you dig around, there's a personnel
4259460	4266500	the master list right master personnel data list. And I urge everybody to file off your
4266500	4272260	Freedom of Information Act requests to the CIA and the NSA and the Air Force and Air Force
4272260	4280260	Office of Special Investigations and try to dig up more information and more FBI files on those
4280260	4288340	those people and individuals or go to the National Archives. So there's loads of research to be done.
4288340	4297140	It's just you got to pay people to do it. Right. This is a limited bandwidth. Everybody in ufology
4297140	4303620	sort of has this, you know, peak of enthusiasm and then it wanes and then you sort of have the
4303620	4312500	trough disillusionment and then if you keep going, you keep learning more. It's a complicated world.
4312500	4317540	The mention of Cantwheel sometimes mistaken as Cantwell here gives us a great opportunity
4317540	4322900	to analyze what we know about the majestic document leaks and their sources. There are three
4322900	4328820	major sources of document leaks. One, Cantwheel, who supplied much of the material we've covered
4328820	4335300	today to Tim Cooper, such as the IPU report and field order, Hill encoder magic memo,
4335300	4341860	first annual report and the JFK to director of the CIA documents. Selena, the alleged daughter
4341860	4347140	of Cantwheel supplied Cooper with 10 short memos alongside documents like the twining white
4347140	4353060	hot report, Eisenhower to Oppenheimer memo and directive from twining to Truman. And lastly,
4353060	4358420	we have source one who supplied the burn memo we spoke about earlier. In his letter to Cooper,
4358420	4364420	Thomas Cantwheel took ownership for many of the mailbox majestic document drops starting in 1992.
4364980	4370180	Timothy Cooper investigated Mr. Cantwheel and legally bound his findings in a five page affid
4370180	4375620	David distributed to Stanton Friedman and Dr. Bob Wood that can be found on MajesticDocuments.com.
4376420	4380180	Information obtained by Cooper and shared with Stanton and Bob
4380180	4385780	include claims of Cantwheel's background. Cantwheel himself stated to be part of the quote
4385780	4391620	counterintelligence core CIC scientific and technical branch interplanetary phenomenon
4391620	4400100	unit from 1942 to 1958. According to Cantwell, he served in the CIC until 1980 and worked for
4400100	4407620	CIA covert operations in the 60s and had contacts with the FBI, KGB and GRU. He claimed to have
4407620	4412900	retired as Lieutenant Colonel and been involved with the majestic community, Majcom and the
4412900	4419620	super secret 5412 group end quote. Well respected Reddit user Harry is white hot has spearheaded
4419620	4424260	an investigation into identifying this mysterious Cantwheel so credit for his amazing work.
4424820	4431620	Harry has proposed the idea for why CIA operative Boris Dmitry Tarasov is the man behind the enigmatic
4431620	4438580	Thomas Cantwheel. Tarasov's CIA career spanned between 1956 and 1968 after immigrating to the
4438580	4444420	US from Russia where his Russian language abilities proved invaluable to US intelligence agencies.
4444420	4451380	His US Army records from the counterintelligence core range from 1942 to 1945 where Tarasov then
4451380	4457380	left to the CIC to work for the Red Cross in Cleveland, Ohio. Harry wisely points out this
4457380	4463300	Red Cross work likely is a cover story for work on the IPU stationed out of right field which is
4463300	4469060	located in northern Ohio near Cleveland. Right field also house the army air material command
4469060	4475060	where General Nathan Twining alleged majestic 12 member was stationed. It's worth mentioning
4475060	4480100	during his time at the American National Red Cross Tarasov was employed for building maintenance
4480100	4486980	engineering under a social agency. One must ask why a counterintelligence operator tasked with quote
4486980	4492180	detailed composition of the foreign armies and their intelligence services approach and interrogation
4492180	4497460	of the enemy military personnel and civilian detection and prevention of the acts of sabotage
4497460	4503540	end quote would leave for a social agency four years into their career before rejoining the CIA.
4504260	4509140	Interesting connection here as well in Cooper's description of Cantwheel he states while Cantwheel
4509140	4515620	was part of the CIA and CIC he interrogated agents in West Germany. We can see on Tarasov's official
4515620	4523140	record in 1945 the agent attended the advanced CIC school in Ober Erself Germany where he was tasked
4523140	4528660	with quote extracting the necessary information from the enemy population military and members of
4528660	4533860	the Nazi party end quote. In his analysis of Cantwheel Cooper also states Cantwheel served as
4533860	4540740	US Army intelligence in Washington DC from 42 to 45. Well we can find Tarasov attended the Military
4540740	4547140	Intelligence Training Center and performed CIC work at Camp Richie Maryland a mere 70 miles from
4547140	4552980	DC in the year of 1945. At the time of Cooper sharing his investigation with Friedman and Wood
4552980	4559380	he believed Cantwheel to be living in California and to be in his 90s. We can find no obituary for
4559380	4565220	Tarasov but at the time of this personal history statement titled CIA historical review program
4565220	4572100	released as sanitized released in 1998 just two years removed from Cooper's investigation. Tarasov
4572100	4578340	was indeed living in San Leandro California born in 1908 this would have made Tarasov 88 at the
4578340	4583780	time of Cooper's investigation if he was still alive when Cooper received his letter. This rabbit
4583780	4589540	hole goes much deeper with Tarasov being stationed in 1963 as a translator operations officer in
4589540	4594740	Mexico City transcribing and translating some agency surveillance traffic from communist
4594740	4599860	aligned embassies and other specific targets. Tassarov's work was used as evidence to prove
4599860	4606100	that Lee Harvey Oswald visited Soviet compounds so of course Tassarov's work dovetails into the JFK
4606100	4611220	assassination. I personally have my own theory on the concentration of these documents as we see the
4611780	4617620	information collected on the Majestic 12 as a snapshot in time in the 40s and 50s. I draw your
4617620	4625380	attention to the 1954 atomic energy agreement as mentioned in the 2024 and 2025 Schumer legislation
4625380	4632100	which states NHI craft materials and bodies as well as UAP and legacy program information
4632100	4638100	were hushed away as trans classified foreign nuclear materials. I find it interesting after the
4638100	4645300	Psalm 101 which was released in 1954 most majestic documents dated after 54 contain nowhere near the
4645300	4652580	detail on program operations scope and purpose. Perhaps the 54 AEC agreement oversaw a drastic
4652580	4658180	shift in MJ12 records. I relayed this theory to Mr. Wood and he shared the same sentiment.
4658900	4667540	That's absolutely true. I think that's when it it sort of happened and and that's maybe why we got
4667540	4673460	the special operations manual is that you know the the Air Force officers that were responsible for
4673460	4678180	this basically got the rug pulled out of them said no no you guys don't get to do this anymore
4678180	4686900	it's going someplace else and people were pissed and this guy took it and decided at some point he
4686900	4691940	was going to leak it. Mr. Wood and myself circled back to the personnel list I touched on earlier
4691940	4697140	in the video with some of the original members named in the MJ12. I asked Mr. Wood about names
4697140	4703460	associated with the Majestic 12 that have been overlooked or forgotten about. Yeah I mean it's
4703460	4713460	in the white hot report it's mentioned that it was really forestall and bush that came together
4713460	4718260	and said we need to form this top secret research and development intelligence
4718260	4724260	gathering organization and I think it's also mentioned right there on the the front couple
4724340	4730740	pages of the special operations manual the history of the group where it talks about
4731460	4738260	special classified presidential order and James v. forestall and van of our bush
4739860	4746180	you know formed the group or recommended to the president to do that. Now forestall
4747300	4753780	you know he had a little bit of a drinking problem and he was very much of the attitude
4753780	4762100	that we need to be more open and potentially discuss this with more people. I don't know if
4762100	4771780	he was all the way to go public but he was thrown out the 75th well thrown out the top floor of
4771780	4779780	Bethesda Mizz Naval Hospital or fell out the floor or something. He fenestrated as they say
4779780	4786420	although I don't think it was windows it was you know bars but anyway he lost his life over that
4786420	4791780	and and actually one of the majestic documents that says it's even necessary and regrettable
4791780	4800340	that forestall had to lose his life and my book magic eyes only there's a dedication
4800340	4805540	to those that have lost their lives for the sake of UFO secrecy and forestall is clearly one person
4805540	4811220	that he lost his life for that sake of secrecy. So outside of bush and forestall are there any
4811220	4816020	kind of names that you think as you were talking about how the majestic documents in the master
4816020	4820580	list needs further investigation are there any names that you think are absolutely crucial
4820580	4826980	to study and or have kind of been looked over and forgotten about? Yeah I think so there's
4827940	4838660	the White Hot Report which is you know it's basically this is the group that went to Roswell
4839300	4846740	and did a bunch of analysis and worked all over the summer to create this report in September.
4846740	4854580	So it happened in July and this everybody went crazy and investigated and wrote up this report
4854980	4861460	and presented it to the president and others and there's the members of the mission.
4862900	4869380	You know there's people like Captain Charles Buchanan who the hell is he? I still haven't found
4869380	4878340	him and what's his military personnel record file like or Robert Ginsberg, Colonel Robert
4878340	4884420	Ginsberg or Captain Richard Glass or I mean Carl Hummelstein is a big well-known person.
4884980	4889300	Major General Stephen Chamberlain assistant chief of staff for intelligence he was certainly
4889300	4895860	a known you know major George McDonald that was his Chamberlain's boss. He was you know
4895860	4904180	he was like the chief of staff for the Air Force. Admiral Paul Lee he's very well known.
4904180	4909780	Leslie Groves head of the Manhattan Project he was he had all his team members there.
4911460	4918900	James Lay Jr. Thomas Lynch which is the finance guy in the Treasury Department.
4920340	4929700	So they had you know they got Navy and Air Force and finance people and as well as you know
4930660	4938580	von Karman and Oppenheimer and Doolittle, James Doolittle and Professor Einstein. So there's loads
4938580	4944820	and that's just one document where you could dig into the next level. You could write a whole book
4945460	4951540	on just that one document and all the interconnections and the validations of every single sentence
4951540	4956980	and every single linkage between people and their correspondence. It's a huge amount of work.
4956980	4962340	I mean I'd love to give somebody here's 50 grand. I want you to go write a whole book on
4962340	4968260	this one topic and go spend a year researching. And as I mentioned before we really do observe
4968260	4973540	the Majestic 12 as a snapshot in time. Myself and I'm sure every viewer of this video wonders
4973540	4979060	about the evolution of the alleged group. How they operate today and if in 2024 there is still
4979060	4986100	a group known as the Majestic 12. So the documents sort of in the history point of view are stop in
4986180	4999380	the mid 50s or so with the fifth annual report on Majestic. And I suspect that it's probably still
4999380	5007540	has the same name. It's such a rare club you know to lose that history and change the name seems
5007540	5014900	silly but they could do it. And there's probably certainly a lot of subclassifications
5015620	5024740	and different groups that are focused on hardware or bodies. Those are obvious bifurcations
5024740	5030020	of classification. But then probably within each of those there's probably additional
5030020	5037940	classifications to compartmentalize it and get into buckets where they could potentially work
5037940	5046740	with private corporations or other organizations. But in my mind it's the aerospace corporation
5046740	5056420	and the Carlisle group and EG&G and some of them the historical ones I mean Rand for example
5056500	5063300	was up to their eyeballs and this stuff. And there's probably a lot of them that have done
5064020	5069540	research historically. We have heard so much from Ryan about his involvement with the Majestic 12
5069540	5076100	but another key player is his father Dr. Robert Wood. Why did Dr. Bob a rocket scientist get
5076100	5090020	involved with UFOs in the Majestic documents? It was maybe 1967 or so 1967 where he started
5090020	5096980	reading a bunch of UFO books and convinced his management that are we gonna figure out how the
5096980	5103140	UFOs work before or after Lockheed does and they they said well how much money you want to try to
5103140	5109540	work on that bomb. And so he spent internal R&D Douglas aircraft company money and then
5111060	5117540	then the merger happened to McDonald Douglas. But so for a couple years they spent the equivalent
5117540	5127060	of four and a half million dollars working on gravity experiments theory. They interviewed
5127060	5136420	abductees. I mean I remember as a you know a little boy you know 13-14 going out to the Mojave
5136420	5146740	desert and one of his engineers was out there with a magnetometer and strip chart recorders and
5146740	5152980	they had anomalous events and sleeping on this couch in this you know high heat in the desert and
5153540	5163140	it was fun for for a kid at the time. So that was that was his work. They didn't have any
5163140	5172900	access to classified information but that was the start of his deep interest in UFOs and actually
5172900	5180900	he hired Stan Friedman to work for him and look at the nuclear physics aspect of UFO propulsion.
5181860	5187380	Viewers of my channel will remember Project Moondust an official group proposed in 1961
5187380	5194180	by the U.S. Air Force alongside projects Blue Fly and UFO. Moondust was tasked to quote locate,
5194180	5200260	recover and deliver descended foreign space vehicles and quote. Moondust counterpart Blue Fly
5200260	5205940	served to quote facilitate expeditious delivery to foreign technology division of Moondust or
5205940	5211700	other items of great technological intelligence interest and quote. In my video on Moondust we
5211700	5217940	covered a variety of fascinating cases occurring in Nepal, Afghanistan, Canada and a 1965 case in
5217940	5223780	the Congo with an accompanying memo titled fragment metal recovered in the Republic of the Congo.
5223780	5229380	Origin believed to be an unidentified flying object. Moondust does indeed have connections to
5229380	5234020	the majestic documents in a fascinating original document called the Bowen manuscript.
5234580	5243220	Oh yeah I mean Moondust is definitely a recovery organization. I mean it's space junk primarily
5243220	5251460	but occasionally it's you know down saucers and so if there's some obvious evidence that it's a
5251460	5259220	saucer they may have a different team that goes but the Moondust people were very much involved
5259460	5269060	um and so that's logical that they would do that. I guess I wanted to bring up one final
5269060	5276740	thought for you is that many people say oh these are all photocopies uh and um and I guess I just
5276740	5283700	wanted to highlight you know one of the leaked ones um well sent from Fort Meade from Freedom
5283700	5290900	Information Act office was this one Top Secret Magic. This is original onion skin
5294500	5302900	paper that we've done forensic analysis on and for ink and pencil marks and it has
5302900	5310740	commenced by Vannevar Bush and it has hints of we have anti-gravity craft in you know 1960s.
5311460	5318500	Uh the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers the the Bowen manuscript and actually there's a book
5318500	5324980	that um it's on Amazon called the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers by Vernon Bowen who who wrote it and
5325860	5336500	it's uh it's very well done history of UFO cases from 1960 and before so that's when
5337220	5347060	he typed it sent it into the Air Force and never got it back until um 39 years later. Wow and the
5347060	5354900	document has comments from Vannevar Bush. Yeah it's yeah it's like there's there's comments in
5354900	5360900	marginalia and in pan and ink marks like you know what is Don Menzel doing question mark
5361860	5370820	in relation to these comments in the topic and then uh another one was um in relation to
5372020	5382260	could these craft be our man-made uh uh you know experimental vehicles and hand written on the side
5382260	5392580	in ink is this should not get out uh implying in my mind that uh very of deep concern that we're
5393220	5401620	got gravity control craft. Wow. And so that's uh that's juicy. My research and my father's
5401620	5409140	research on the majestic documents is um rich and robust and highly supportive of their authenticity
5409140	5417060	and credibility and I welcome objections to it and if if you have some it's fake because uh statement
5417060	5426020	or I don't like it because I'm all ears but I've not found any credible objections. All right thank
5426020	5432660	you so much Mr. Wood. Thank you. What's up guys thank you so much for joining me into this
5432660	5438260	investigation and documentary on the majestic 12 and majestic documents. Before I get into my
5438260	5444500	usual ramblings at the end of every video I need to say a couple things one thank you Mr. Ryan S. Wood
5444500	5449540	thank you for sitting down with me doing this interview answering hours of questions and emails
5449540	5454420	in the majestic documents the majestic 12 me requesting additional files me requesting images
5454420	5461140	and so forth this man is truly of incredible character and I am so thankful one of my biggest
5461140	5466180	inspirations in the field of ufology agreed to sit down with me and cover the majestic documents.
5466900	5469860	For anybody who has watched a single one of my videos you know I reference
5470820	5475700	this book magic eyes only as the greatest book I have ever read on UFO crash retrievals by Ryan S.
5475700	5480660	Wood. I highly encourage anybody to purchase this book because it also covers much of the majestic
5480660	5485620	12 including the authenticating of the special operations manual. It also includes a full copy
5485620	5491220	of the special operations manual. Third Ryan S. Wood has a beautiful tool I don't see referenced
5491220	5499700	much this is a website called ufo decks ufo dex.com what this is Ryan S. Wood trained a chat GPT
5499700	5506580	model and scanned in between 500 and 800 UFO books you can submit a question on any topic in
5506580	5512260	ufology and receive an answer from Mr. Wood. I myself have used this tool dozens of times
5512260	5518900	and I've used it in a lot of my past research such as referencing the 1974 koyame case discussing a
5518900	5523300	certain private corporation I'm going to cover soon and I even asked it about underwater bases
5523300	5530340	that NHI might inhabit after reading and hearing about some parts of Lou Elizondo's new statements.
5530340	5536020	So thank you Mr. Wood please get a copy of magic eyes only please go to majesticdocuments.com where
5536020	5542020	you can read all 33 or 35 of the reports I referenced today in depth of course with
5542020	5545780	YouTube video descriptions it's a little too tough to include all links especially when I have
5545780	5551380	between 50 and 60 research files so you'll look in the video description you will see every document
5551380	5556180	we covered today which is over 30 you'll find the exact name go to majesticdocuments.com punch
5556180	5560500	that in copy and paste it review the document while watching the video I think that's really
5560500	5564020	important when we're discussing a document you can have it on another monitor I'm part of your
5564020	5567460	screen kind of read through what we're going through you know me I like to cite my work so
5567460	5573300	all of these documents will be available for you to read super easily okay onto my ramblings the
5573300	5578580	majestic 12 has consumed my life for the past couple of weeks to the point where I have not even
5578580	5585540	touched this and this is going to be my next reading I cannot wait to dive in but I highly
5585540	5591460	recommend anybody get the majestic magic eyes only book and a book I referenced multiple times in
5591460	5596420	the video top secret magic by Stanton Friedman if you want to learn more until the authentication
5596420	5601780	of the Eisenhower briefing document Cutler 20 memo Truman forest all memo this is the book for you
5601780	5608260	it was written in the 90s but this is a beautiful piece that's so useful to investigate more into
5608260	5614420	what we've been talking about today Stanton Friedman is a legend amongst Ryan Wood Robert Wood so
5614420	5619620	please check out this book if you want to learn more it's fantastic so now we can get onto some
5619620	5624180	of my thoughts anybody who's watched my videos knows more and more over time I've been referencing
5624180	5629380	the majestic documents a perfect example is my last video the 1974 koyame crash retrieval
5629380	5635620	I referenced the first annual majestic report as well as the ipu report before that in my 1955
5635620	5640820	crash video near del Rio Texas I referenced the Eisenhower briefing document in the 1950 crash
5640820	5645140	listed there also touched on by Lou Elizondo to have occurred near El Indio in Guerrero
5646340	5650740	I made some statements public that I thought that the majestic 12 was likely a real organization
5650740	5656420	and the majestic files had probably been a mix of information and disinformation at that time I
5656420	5661140	had not spent the amount of time I have now pouring through the documents looking at connections
5661140	5666980	looking at research and just immersing myself in so much time I think the majestic 12 encompasses
5666980	5674020	so much more than what I initially suspected uh what really took me by surprise was the amount
5674020	5678980	of length behind authenticating the Eisenhower briefing document and special operations manual
5678980	5683780	those of course are two of the big heavy hitters we talk about this in this stock in this video
5684660	5689220	but towards the end of the video you'll remember the bowen manuscript and you remember how
5690260	5695700	the author bowen I can't remember his first name sent this into the Department of Defense in 1960
5695700	5702100	to get it reviewed he never got a copy back it wasn't until 1999 Timothy Cooper got this uh
5702100	5709620	from a foyer designation Fort Mead with comments all over it from vanavar bush and stamp top secret
5709620	5715060	magic now of course we discussed how this referenced moondust uh that vanavar bush made
5715060	5723940	comments on uh anti-gravity vehicles but this the discussion of moondust and insect like beans
5723940	5729380	reminded me so much of Dr. Sarbacher and of course I discussed that video Dr. Sarbacher
5729380	5735700	multiple times but we have to remember that within the majestic files one if not the key player is
5735700	5741540	Dr. vanavar bush of course the beginning of the majestic leaks occurred in 1980 but the thing is
5742420	5750340	we can trace Dr. Robert Sarbacher discussing vanavar bush directing UFO study in the U.S.
5750340	5757140	government as far back as 1950 around the time of the alleged mj-12 connection so I never thought
5757140	5762260	the Sarbacher connections would go so deep here remember Dr. Sarbacher even when talking to uh
5762260	5768180	Stanton Freeman namedrop Dr. Eric Walker Dr. Eric Walker himself confirmed to know of the mj-12's
5768180	5774660	existence to say it's real along with a really interesting quote that reminded me of Don Quixote
5774660	5778500	chasing at windmills perhaps what he meant by this is you might have the majestic documents
5778500	5783860	because I believe this uh interview came out in the mid to late 80s Sweden have all the majestic
5783860	5789460	documents I think that he may have meant you might have these majestic documents you may be able to
5789460	5794660	read them but you will never get to the bottom of it it's futile to try and fully grasp the
5794660	5799460	extent of the majestic files and speaking of Dr. Eric Walker what really interests me thinking
5799460	5805300	about now is how his claims about a ESP getting into the program and so forth so that was just
5805300	5809940	fascinating to me the connections with Sarbacher because remember Sarbacher described insect like
5809940	5815940	beans as well in the encyclopedia flying saucers vanavar bush underlining these subjects is so
5816020	5821860	fascinating and let's not forget at the end of the 14 page sample provided on majesticdocuments.com
5821860	5827140	there's a section talking about Mussolini and Hitler uh being exposed to some sort of craft
5827140	5833380	in 1942 vanavar bush underlines this as well almost underlines a whole paragraph this brings
5833380	5839460	my mind back to the 1933 magenta italy case anybody else it's just it's really fascinating um
5840180	5844580	some of the other documents that really interest me of course are the ipu report
5844580	5848660	nine pages talks about the sandia lab technicians talks about the crew at roswell
5849380	5854340	so much of these documents kind of focus around roswell right i think there's so much more work
5854340	5859300	to be done on the jfk assassination in mj12 so much more work to be done on forestall's death in the
5859300	5864820	mj12 because that's very interesting i think many people think of a conspiracy around forestall's
5864820	5870340	death as well throwing himself out the 13th story of a of a naval hospital room so there's
5870340	5873380	so much more work to be done there and there's so much more work to be done on the majestic
5873380	5879620	documents in general right uh as mr wood has said much of these documents as he likes to say
5880180	5884580	are onion skin where we have original copies in fact i'd say that's the minority of the reports
5884580	5890100	many of them are facts from triax film uh photo copies and so forth so there's some provenance
5890100	5895540	work that can't be done on these documents like mr wood has done with the bow and manuscript actually
5895620	5902340	dating the ink back to 1962 of when vanavar bush wrote moondust on the the paper so
5903860	5909540	i think if we look at the majestic 12 we can't argue for the validity of all of these documents
5909540	5916900	but i think it is a safe line of research to kind of understand the majestic 12 likely was
5916900	5922900	likely was and possibly is a real group tasked with the study material exploitation
5923540	5929460	and reverse engineering and crash retrieval of ufo's how that looks today i would reckon
5929460	5934420	it involves much more of a private sector uh as beautiful as it is with the sarbacher video we
5934420	5940420	get to see a snapshot of the early days of ufo crash retrieval and i think the majestic documents
5940420	5946020	are the perfect example of really investigating the early days the early players the early
5946020	5952180	organization and the early procedures of ufo crash retrieval but anyway guys remember magic eyes
