description: "Volume 2 of a new series analyzing UFO whistleblowers throughout history\
  \ where I will review the claims and credibility of the most interesting claims\
  \ surrounding the UAP phenomenon. These whistleblowers can be of ironclad reputation\
  \ like David Grusch, bound by legal testimony like Robert Salas, or have interesting\
  \ stories with no real evidence like Bob Lazar.\n\nToday's video focuses on 3 sets\
  \ of claims - Harland Bentley who claimed to have observed a UFO crash in Maryland,\
  \ Senator Barry Goldwater who was denied access to the \"Blue Room\" of Wright Patterson\
  \ AFB, and the enigmatic Marine RB who claimed to have guarded a nonhuman vehicle\
  \ in 1963.\n\nBentley's background, at least in public realms, is nonverifiable\
  \ but his claims of a UAP crash near a Nike Ajax Missile in Maryland as well as\
  \ the crew of Apollo 8 encountering a craft on their way to Apollo 8 carry some\
  \ astounding parallel research. \n\nGoldwater famously was denied access to the\
  \ \"blue room\" of WPAFB where UAP material was stored by General Curtis Lemay.\
  \ This statement is powerful, especially with the intrigue of non-human technology\
  \ surrounding WPAFB at this time, the connections of Lemay to UFO, as well as FOIA\
  \ requests on destroyed Blue Room documentation.\n\nRB's story has no verifiable\
  \ elements as of this video but it is compelling and fantastic. The marine who claimed\
  \ to guard a UAP for 2 weeks offers astonishing detail into the craft's makeup as\
  \ well as scientific and military practices around the craft.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:38\
