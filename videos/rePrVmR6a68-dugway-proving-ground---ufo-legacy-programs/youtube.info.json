    "description": "An in-depth investigation into Dugway Proving Ground and the site's long history of involvement with UFO reverse engineering and technology of unknown origin (TUO) exploitation programs. Often referred to as Area 52, Dugway Proving Ground serves as the US Army's premiere chemical and biological weapons testing facility spanning over 1,250 square miles in the Utah Desert. Dugway is host to two DOD Major Range Test and Facility Bases (MRTFB) - the Army West Desert Test Center, and the southern range of the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR). MRTFBs serve as the DOD's \"critical core\" for all test and evaluation of military vehicles, equipment, and weaponry.\n\nThis investigation harnesses the witness testimony of one M.S. who incidentally stumbled on a clandestine group of scientists and armed personnel engaging with a non-human craft in the Dugway Avery Region. The project analyzes this testimony to form a thesis both Dugway MRTFBs operate a joint UFO reverse engineering program with an emphasis on chemical and biological concepts re UAP.\n\nAdditionally, the project aims to explore claims of projects being moved from Area 51 to \"Area 52\" (Dugway) and investigate numerous claims of a Deep Underground Military Base (DUMB) below the Utah range. \n\n0:00 Intro\n03:27 Dugway Overview \n11:22 DPG & UFO\n29:41 M.S.
