The Gorman Dogfight, the Finnish UAP Air Force Sighting of 1969, the Arequipa Encounter, and the 2004 Mexican Air Force Incident are extremely underrepresented cases when compared to the incredibly famous Gimbal, Go Fast, and UFO tapes released by the NYT in 2017.  \n\nUFO cases by military air forces, navy, or ground personnel are often extremely credible sightings due to multi-sensor detection and the keen, trained eye of fighter pilots. Oftentimes, global sightings are drowned out by the ever-popular US cases; so for that reason, let's cover not just the US but Global UFO encounters with military jets.\n\nSome cases pictured are legendary in their respective countries and some have been discovered through official USG Project Sign or Moon Dust Documents. So what do you think? Did these pilots experience Unidentified Aerial Phenomena or are their sightings explained away through prosaic means?
