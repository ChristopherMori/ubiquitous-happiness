1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Okay. We'll see. Hello, everybody. We are live. If you guys can hear, please just post

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,720
in the comments that you're hearing us and we can get started. So I need to see, usually

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,920
there, now the live counter's up. So there we go. Now it'll start populating. There's

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,920
definitely more than, okay, zero people in. We've got 13 people here. What is up, guys?

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,360
Can you hear us? Can you hear us? Can you hear us? Somebody let us know. And then I need

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,240
to hop on Twitter and say, and put the live link as well. So let's just see while this

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,920
kind of sorts itself out. Sweet. They can hear us. I'd put it on my Twitter as well,

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,440
but I have like two followers. Okay. Okay. Sweet. Sweet. Sweet. So guys, let me post

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,280
a tweet real fast, but I'll do another introduction as more people start filtering in. But this

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,440
is Kermit. He is the researcher you guys know who helped me out with the SAIC. Hey, it's

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,040
C. Britton. Yeah. He helped tremendously with SAIC, looking at contracts, working that

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,840
case with me. So let me just get a tweet out real fast. Kermit, if you just want to introduce

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,040
yourself while I'm doing this, please feel free. Hey, y'all. I'm Kermit. How's it going?

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,200
I've been posting about UFO stuff under the Reddit name frog and badger. My kind of angle

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,600
with this is kind of the legal financial framework, you know, specifically, you know,

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,680
we heard today, I mean, yesterday from the representatives about how they're interested

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,640
in how taxpayer funds are being spent on these programs. And that's kind of my, it's kind

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,920
of my area of expertise and my intellectual curiosity, so to speak. So been very, very

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,320
blessed to be able to work with Gerb the past couple of months on a bunch of different projects.

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,040
He came to me over the summer is like, Hey, I want to put out this, this documentary on

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,760
a company that you've been actually doing a lot of research on. And we did a really

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,240
good collaboration for that. I'm actually very happy with how it turned out. And yeah,

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,120
just been just digging through financial filings and trying to making, trying to make sense

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,520
of this legacy program, you know, so the truth is out there.

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:11,520
All right. All right. I'm almost done. Live. Sorry, guys. I'm just posting this on Twitter.

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,760
Might as well just show everyone in the chat here. Gerb and I were able to visit the National

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,600
Air and Space Museum and I was able to pick up a reproduction vehicle. If you want to

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,560
call it that B2 stealth bomber. So for any right there, you know, for anybody that doesn't

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,320
know there are classic stories of the B2 bomber utilizing, utilizing electrogravity technology

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,560
for an internal mass reduction of up to 89% and then electrogravity technology to kind

31
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,320
of obfuscate both exhaust signatures and radar cross section. So I'm posting this guys

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:55,760
and then we shall get started right away. Let's do it. Okay. So we'll start just looking.

33
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,400
What we'll do guys is we'll kind of talk about our time in DC. We're both in here right now

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:07,120
at Capitol Hill. So I'd like to talk a little bit about DC and the hearings as well as we

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,160
were able to attend the UAP disclosure fund meeting last night. So we got a lot to talk

36
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,960
about. We'll talk about immaculate constellation and everything and then we'll kind of go through

37
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,960
questions and so forth. So C's is asking right now, who is that guy? C's will say it again.

38
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,200
He just introduced himself, but this is Kermit. He's the excellent researcher who helps me

39
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,040
out with the SAIC research. His, his, the link to his Reddit will be in the description

40
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,800
page. He's made some awesome posts on kind of analyzing the legacy program framework

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,920
within SEC securities frameworks and stuff. And if you want to tell a little bit about

42
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,440
that, I'm a little bit about that post. I'm sure people would love to hear that. Yeah,

43
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,520
for sure. My, my most recent posts that I published, I want to say a month and a half

44
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,520
ago, I kind of looked at kind of all the laws in the books around like national security

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,160
programs and then not disclosing those operations on like a private company's financial statements.

46
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,680
So going back like almost a hundred years back to the SEC act of 1934, which kind of

47
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,040
historical context that was written into law because of the Great Depression and trying

48
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,040
to reform the banking system, but included within the SEC act of 1934 was a specific

49
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,120
exemption that allowed for the president and the heads of his executive agencies to waive

50
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,160
reporting requirements for any company that was involved with classified activities under

51
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,240
an executive order. So basically from that, and then throughout kind of the chronology

52
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,360
over decades, we kind of see a strengthening of those laws and those regulations that allow

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,440
for companies like Lockheed Martin, SAIC, you know, other defense primes to basically, you

54
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,000
know, do this classified work and not be as transparent or use a little bit more discretion

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,760
with how they report those operations in their financial statements.

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,080
And that's such interesting work. I mean, I know of some other individuals who are trying

57
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,200
to kind of attack legacy program for more of a financial framework. And this is something

58
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,200
that I personally don't see enough in the industry and kind of UAP researchers. So I

59
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,160
think that's really interesting, you know, carrying on the legacy of Katharine Austin

60
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,440
Fitz, the black budget of the United States and so forth. I just, I just need to make

61
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,160
sure we're caught up. I'm right now I'm worried about the this Wi-Fi here in the hotel. So

62
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm just checking up that our dang stream is live guys. I'm sorry. We're at the holiday

63
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,480
in Capitol Hill and okay, we are perfect. It doesn't have the best Wi-Fi. Okay. So already

64
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm like in Kermit, dude. Kermit's the dog. We've been having so much fun. So, you know,

65
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,960
we'll talk a little bit about the hearings. We both got in on Tuesday night. I was fortunate

66
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,400
enough to get a media pass for the hearings. So that was awesome. Yeah. If you guys see

67
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,840
some of the photos of, I think, who is it, Brett Higgins? Yeah. I mean, the profile picture

68
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,320
of the video from, I think Higgins, I'm kind of right there on the side. It was really

69
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,240
cool because, you know, right in front of the witnesses was Amar from the S Theory and some

70
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,960
other photographers snapping away. You know, inside the room, we'll talk about that. We'll

71
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,960
talk about the lines and so forth. This, we talked to many, many, many of the big dogs. Oh,

72
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,600
you know, we did. We did. Oh yeah. Yes. And we'll also talk about the event horizon interview

73
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,240
as well because something or someone I'm quite close to Ross, the producer of event horizon

74
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,520
and then John Michael Godier. So I've been able to talk to them a ton. T.W. This is a

75
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,960
friend of mine. There's no Peter here. This is Kermit, but thanks, Steve. Yeah. So doors

76
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,880
for the house building, they opened at 7, 7 a.m. Actually earlier than that, there were

77
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,000
people standing in line at like midnight, night before. I think one of them was Robert

78
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,520
Salas, but I think some people like Matt from the Good Trouble show have been getting heat

79
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,920
from Green Street because they actually paid professional waiters to wait in line. So I

80
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,680
had a, because I had the media pass, you know, I was afforded a little extra time. I was

81
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,200
going to go in right away, but I had some issues just sleep and do the excitement. So I had

82
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,920
to wait maybe an hour or two before you. So he showed up at actual 7 a.m. So what was

83
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,040
it like first doors, doors open and waiting to get in? Yeah. I mean, strolling, strolling

84
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,200
down Capitol Ave to go to the Rayburn office building. I've never attended. I've never

85
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,880
been inside like the Capitol building or any of that stuff. I've never attended hearings

86
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,200
before. So this is like a new experience for me. And I showed up like in kind of the line

87
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,840
for the UFO hearing at like about seven that morning. And at that point, like the line

88
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,840
was very, very deep. And I will say there were a lot of people in that line at that point

89
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,520
that I was like, Oh my God, like that's, that's Matt for that's Lester. Like, Oh my God. It

90
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,240
was a verifiable like who's who have, you know, UFO world and got to take a lot of people's

91
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,280
hands, got to meet a bunch of really cool people. Unfortunately, I was in kind of the

92
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,720
point or the part of the line that ended up not making it into the main room. I was like

93
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,440
10 people off from getting into that main area. But thankfully the staffers were able

94
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,560
to take kind of the rest of us, put us up an overflow and watch that live upstairs.

95
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,320
So I mean, not great, but you know, it is one of the picture of the overflow TV. Yeah,

96
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,040
for sure. I felt terrible about these guys because, you know, I'll just say, yeah, show

97
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,520
it. And then I'll make a quick comment because, you know, I got a lot to say from an almost

98
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,000
exact opposite point of view. I mean, it seemed like going in like it seemed like the hearing

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,200
room is going to be a bit bigger than the one last year. And it was the same hearing room

100
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,480
guy. It was the exact same hearing room. Oh, was the exact? Yes. Yes. But there. So there

101
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,480
was there were like, I think five rows of seats. Yeah. So this is, I don't know if you guys

102
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,920
can see this. If you hold it closer, it should auto adjust. Oh, no. Yes. There we go. That's

103
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:48,120
the TV. That was the screen that I was watching from everybody. Yeah. Front row seat kind

104
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,640
of, which is cool. Let's get the camera to auto adjust. Oh, that adjusted poorly. There

105
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,520
we go. Okay. It's starting to work. I won't, I won't show my phone. I won't show any other

106
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,280
pictures. We're still washed out with light, but that's all right. So kind of from from

107
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,760
my POV, I got to go in at a hearing started at 1130. I got to go in at 11 through the

108
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,480
media entrance. Some other people who got to do that were Jesse Amar from Yes Theory,

109
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,840
Chris from Area 52. He recently put out the, the Project Gravitar interview. And I got

110
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,200
to talk to him. I never met him. He's awesome. I really liked speaking to him. Chris was

111
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,480
great. You know, Jesse was rocking around and kind of his more laxed where I think it's

112
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,840
so funny because only Jesse could get away with that. In line, you know, most people

113
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,840
have their suits on. They're looking quite dapper. They're ready to go. And then there

114
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,920
is, there's some people out there with like alien headbands on.

115
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,320
There was, there was a lot of different fits on, man. There's, there were a bunch of different

116
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,680
people. I mean, talk about, talk about a like very, it's just like, like all walks of life.

117
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,200
You know what I mean? So then that was really cool to see too.

118
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,680
All walks of life unifying.

119
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,160
But the only person that could really pull it off, I'd say was, was Jesse. The only person

120
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,160
who looked like normal in a sense with a kind of strange bloving on was Jesse. But yeah,

121
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,080
some of the people that were pretty early in line were like Robert Salas. I think Chris

122
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,520
Bledsoe was there. But as far as people meeting, waiting in line, waiting in line met a ton

123
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,360
of people. There were actually a couple of people who recognized my name, which was really

124
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,840
cool. There are a few people like that. It was awesome. It was great to talk to some people.

125
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:23,040
So many people showed out. But you know, before getting in, talk to Jesse, Area 52, James

126
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,720
Fox, a bunch. James Fox actually posted a video, kind of walking through the hall. And

127
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,980
I think I walked right in front of him and I just looked like an idiot in that Lester

128
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,680
Nair as well from the UAP Caucus. He's a friend of ours. He actually was one of the people

129
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,920
who helped us get into the UAPDF. And that was really great. But so getting into the

130
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,280
actual witness room, we got to get in 30 minutes early. And from there, some of the RSVP, some

131
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,480
of the reserved seats got to pour in. And this took up about three or two and a half of the

132
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,960
five rows. And of these people were people you'd expect, you know, Leslie Kane, we'll

133
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,760
talk a little bit more about her later, because I actually got to talk to her for quite a

134
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,720
while at the UAPDF. Jeremy Corbell, I have some good insights as to the drama there.

135
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:17,960
Who else? James Fox, Jesse, Chris, Ryan Graves. A ton of people started pouring in and the

136
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,200
witnesses even early. So before the hearing even started, I got to chat a little bit with

137
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,720
Jeremy and so forth. I actually had a kind of a funny experience with him. I introduced

138
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,200
myself to Jeremy. I said, you know, hello, my name is I gave him my first name. And he's

139
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,080
like, where have I seen you before? And I said, maybe on YouTube under Gerb. And so he

140
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,120
goes, yeah, one of your whistleblowers you spoke to is correct. I went, who? Like who? And

141
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,800
he's like, that should be enough. He just refused to elaborate. He didn't wink at me and said

142
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,360
he had to like center himself a little bit before the before the hearing. So Jeremy, you

143
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,720
know, sometimes I criticize his work a little bit. Everyone's work can be criticized. Everyone's

144
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,360
work has flaws, but he was a really nice guy. I really enjoyed speaking to him. He was a kind

145
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,440
of a class act. However, after the hearing, which we'll discuss a little more, he was pretty

146
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:07,120
upset that he was the one who gave Congress on that day, the 12 page Immaculate Constellation

147
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:15,320
Report. I think Schellenberger's witness gave it to Burchett a while ago, right? But I believe

148
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,880
the situation was at this current day that Jeremy gave the Immaculate Constellation Report

149
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,080
to Mace and others. So there was a point where Mace, in the starting to talk about the hearings,

150
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:35,680
Jeremy started like getting visibly extremely upset, extremely upset. And afterwards, you

151
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,560
know, he was like on the brink of tears. He was so furious. And you know, some people were

152
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,040
talking and trying to get pictures. And he was being really nice about that. He was taking

153
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,160
pictures with everybody, kind of being a class act. But I say, you know, I talked to Merrick

154
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,480
on Renekamp. I said, hey, that's a good Jeremy. And so he explained the situation to me. And so I

155
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,960
went up to talk to Jeremy because this will be coming out in a little bit, but I got to interview

156
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,200
Rhett Burrelson afterwards. Herman was actually my fellow man there. We got some good questions

157
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,560
about there. It's not a super long interview. However, some of the questions asked were on

158
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:14,200
was he expecting other witnesses? Because I think somebody, somebody, jit boy, yeah, by the way,

159
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:20,720
I talked to introduce myself to Oak Shane, and I'm planning to talk to him more. But yeah, some

160
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,520
of the questions asked without spilling any details were, you know, seen if, sorry, just

161
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:33,200
got to, okay, was seen if Burrelson had expected other witnesses, right? Because we all heard

162
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,120
rumors of firsthand, you know, let me first hand guys, crash retrieval, legacy program

163
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,400
witnesses asked him about that, asked him specifically about ARV, asked him specifically

164
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,280
if he's read the Grush op ed, which, you know, I'm sure people really want to hear about

165
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,000
that. And asked him specifically if Congress has received actionable intelligence as it

166
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,080
started to move on some of these locations that have been named. Yeah. So Burrelson, in my

167
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:03,000
opinion, along with Luna and Moskowitz actually asked the whole all the best questions of the

168
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,280
the hearing. So before we get into hearing and discussing some of the questions, what was

169
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,320
asked, a couple funny points per chat with killing diet Mountain Dew, the whole whole show, I

170
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,200
think he had three diet Mountain Dews and like loves that Mountain Dew and Michael Gold was

171
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,640
just eating candy the whole time. He had a Lenovo laptop that had the greasiest trackpad I

172
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:28,360
ever saw. Jimmy, thank you so much. I really appreciate that. Seriously. Falcon head. We

173
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,680
talked about this just now, but Corbell was upset because he submitted the 12 page Immaculate

174
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,120
Constellation report to Nancy Mace right before the hearing. And it was attributed to

175
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,560
Schellenberger, not not Corbell, when the report was kind of entered into the congressional

176
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,000
record, and he was furious about that. And there were only 11 pages, not 12. I think Jesse

177
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,840
just tweeted the last page. Oh, really? Yeah, from Jeremy Kenyon locker Corbell. So if you

178
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,640
guys want to see that go to Jesse Michael's page. And also now's a good time. I posted a

179
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,640
picture of it talked about a little bit because you got to meet Jesse, everybody got to meet

180
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:09,720
Jesse. Last week, I was just out in Austin for to record a show for Jesse. And so that

181
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,300
should be out soon. There we talk about everything from crash retrievals to the McCandless story

182
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,920
to ARV to deep underground military bases. I added in some we actually go a little bit

183
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,880
into ed the witness from Edwards Air Force Base. And we talked a little bit about his

184
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,040
background kind of referencing some of his public stations and so forth. So I think that's

185
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,320
going to be really interesting. Let's uh, while you're looking at that, I think we got

186
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,160
two questions here, including one with Joey had one year to force just one grush hostile

187
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,560
witness or aerospace exec to the stand, but bring gold new Congress one. Yeah, so I think

188
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:51,280
gold is people are pretty hot and cold about gold, right? Yeah. He, you know, he was really

189
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:58,520
pro NASA, which I think NASA is likely at least somewhat privy to UAP crash retrieval

190
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:05,640
programs. And NASA has historically lied about UAP as well, including a study in 1979 or

191
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:12,520
1980. It was a, sorry, 1978 or 1979. There were FOIA requests where NASA had previously

192
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,360
stated they never looked into UAP, but a bunch of FOIA documents came out showing that NASA

193
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,040
had been taking kind of an eye of UAP reports very seriously. So we will let's see what

194
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,000
Joey says here. What's up, Joey? I thought someone quote for Chet St. Corbell was the

195
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,200
guy who gave him a report months ago. I did hear something. Yeah, I did. I did as well

196
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,480
that he was involved. Yeah. Additionally, have you so, Gurp, have you read the 12th page?

197
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,760
You just skimmed it once. You know, yeah, it is. So it's a cover letter from George Jeremy

198
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,160
Corbell. That was supposed to be the cover letter. And kind of talks a little bit about

199
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,320
how he got the document and all that. But it's not like an additional page of the document.

200
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:57,440
It's basically, it's, I believe Jeremy, you know, trying to, you know, convey that, you

201
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,280
know, he's kind of a part of this effort, you know, in providing this report to Congress.

202
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,560
I think that's what's really the meat of it. Yeah. Okay. I think someone in something

203
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:11,520
in someone as well as Therose here both make good points. Well, you know, it's good to

204
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,120
have a NASA guy calling for more transparency. It's still, you know, how much exactly can

205
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,240
NASA be trusted. Also, this guy was connected with OSAP and Bigelow Aerospace. So why were

206
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,760
questions not asked? And why was the topic not discussed about OSAP trying to kind of

207
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,320
facilitate craft transfer from Lockheed Martin? Yeah, well, they didn't even name Lockheed

208
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,640
Martin. I mean, Lou and others were quite afraid to even name it themselves. And then

209
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,480
even like one of their Congress people was like, Oh, well, we know this is the Lockheed

210
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,080
Martin case. And he said it out loud. But then when the response came back, it wasn't

211
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,600
like, Oh, yeah, it was a con, they said it was a contract. Right. It was a contractor.

212
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,040
But like, you know, as, as we've been kind of understanding the story over years, it's

213
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,920
like, well, we know what that contractor is. So like, why are we being cagey about it?

214
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,240
And where's the money trail? This is something we're digging. This is something that, there's

215
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,400
something that Kermit, tracking down the financials of legacy programs we're trying to uncover.

216
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,520
You know, there's reason to believe that sometimes programs are skimmed off of existing programs

217
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,360
such as the F 35, a 1.5 to $2 trillion program that witness Ed served as a subject matter

218
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,520
expert to various contracting companies after his time in reverse engineering programs at

219
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,280
Air Force. Ed, this witness also stated while working on the R and D panel chain at the Pentagon

220
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,880
that in two fiscal years, 34 billion and then 40 billion and non transfer of authority funds

221
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,840
were kind of issued back channel to legacy programs under the Air Force. So kind of trying

222
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,400
to track this stuff down, but let's see what two cents here.

223
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,600
I have some, I have some sense on this as well. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah. So I think in terms of like

224
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,920
funding, and we want to think about like kind of the avenues of what's kind of going on here,

225
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,360
just over time, I think it's, you know, it would not surprise me if there's kind of a bunch of

226
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,480
different things that are going on at play, because ultimately, right, you're just trying to

227
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,960
obfuscate this financial data so that people that, you know, otherwise have that access to that

228
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,040
information, they can't figure out what that money is actually going towards. Right. So I mean,

229
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,000
in and of itself, the money trail is part of the obfuscation, trying to figure that out is about

230
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,560
as important, I feel like is trying to see the crap and the bodies and all that stuff. So, you

231
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,480
know, it's kind of one of those core tenets and, you know, the truth is out there, but I mean,

232
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,680
I've been in this space for a year and a half, and I still have a bunch of different theories

233
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,920
about it. So we can talk about it for sure. And that's why we're trying to kind of track down

234
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,640
other people with a financial background like Kermit to really kind of make like a think tank

235
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,360
on this subject, because I'm financially illiterate when it comes to tracking this stuff down. I can

236
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,760
just report, like Witness Ed found $34 and $40 billion in non-TOA funds, but I can't really

237
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,800
understand the significance of that or make heads or tails of a balance sheet.

238
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,560
Yeah, because it's one thing for a witness to say, like, this is this is what I saw. But then,

239
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,640
you know, that's the substantive evidence of like, I saw the ledger, I saw the transactions,

240
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,960
this is corroborating basically that story. Right. Yeah, because yeah, Keegan was saying

241
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,240
that's a lot of funds. Yes, it is. I mean, at the R&D panel chain, he was overseeing over 200

242
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,880
billion per year in Air Force funds. Total just to kind of give everybody an idea,

243
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,920
like when we talk about R&D and IRAD, right? Humulatively, the United States government spends

244
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,080
about $150 billion annually just on defense R&D alone. That is a huge chunk of change. So,

245
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,760
I mean, the number could be anywhere from zero to that or even something different than that

246
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,440
entirely. We don't even know. Then there still exists the theory, and I don't know how we would

247
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,600
explore this more, that some of these legacy programs, if they are being conducted out of a

248
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,160
closed off military base, an underground base, perhaps they run off of closed systems.

249
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,280
That's another possibility. Yeah, there are claims out there that some of these locations run

250
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,400
off a cash-based system just as they do analog computers. Well, I'd be smart because you basically

251
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,200
minimize the audit trail, you know, people, just like money talks, right? Right. So, people are

252
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,600
spending money, if you have a, smaller the system and more closed than it is, the less chance that

253
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,200
you have it of being uncovered. And we were at the Air and Space Museum today, and we were kind of

254
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,920
hypothesizing, what if these programs with the craft like the ARV are able to just strip

255
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,800
mine the asteroid belt for precious metals and so forth. Yeah, you don't even need to get capital

256
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,480
or financing or anything here from earth, and you just get everything from your materials and

257
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,600
products off world, then no one's the wiser, right? So, that makes sense. Two cents, thank you so much.

258
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,520
Yeah, speaking of Seoul, Kermit and I will be going as well there. So, I know you guys are

259
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,640
already showing Kermit a lot of love. We'll do another stream after Seoul as well. I can't wait

260
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,640
to do that, and thank you again. Let me just, let me see this, and then we'll keep talking about

261
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,240
the hearings. Thank you, Wag Boss, paying ties to the overlord. Now, I'll never be an overlord.

262
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,480
Let's just hope John Jones gets knocked out this weekend, man, and I'll be a happy dude.

263
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,680
So, you know, I'd like to say, and I'm sure we talked about this a little bit, I was impressed

264
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,520
with Lou, not only with his testimony, but as a person as well. I was able to talk to him quite

265
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,160
a bit, both before the hearings. I just bumped into him while I was scrambly to find the house

266
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,200
building. I got coffee for a couple of friends. So, I'm just walking there. I see Lou outside.

267
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,040
A guy followed by Kermas, and he's like two feet taller, I mean, two feet shorter than the rest of

268
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,760
him. So, I know that's Lou, and I introduced myself and talked to him for a while. He was extremely

269
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:15,280
kind. I think he did well answering questions as well into the congressional report. I've said

270
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,680
this to you, and I'm sure you'll agree. There's still a lot of questions about Lou's background,

271
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:27,520
ASAP and ATIP. Greenwald has diligently tried to get answers to for years, and how the heck are we

272
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,760
going to get answers to what Lou's specific position was? Because now, of course, he has sworn

273
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,240
into congressional testimony that he was a high-ranking member at ASAP, correct? Or was it ATIP?

274
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,480
I'm just trying to remember off the top of my head. Well, I think that's the nature of the debate,

275
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,920
is it not? I think in his book, he claims that he was part of both ASAP and ATIP. ASAP was kind of

276
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,600
the initial effort where they were trying to get that divestiture from Lockheed, and then ATIP kind

277
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,000
of was the effort post-ASAP once that kind of fell through. That's my understanding of it, at least.

278
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,760
And I think one of the most consequential reports is Lou saying he cannot answer about being read

279
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,400
into a congressional program. Yeah, that was quite telling. I thought that was very telling.

280
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,840
So, Lou spoke at the UAPDF, which was kind of a closed event we were able to attend afterwards,

281
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,680
and this speech saw fellow speeches by Representative Burleson and Representative Rounds.

282
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,880
Senator Rounds. Yeah, sorry, Senator Rounds. So, this was a very consequential talk. I had some

283
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,720
time to speak with Lou, because I know a long time ago I had kind of informed some friends that,

284
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,080
via an analyst friend, that Lou would be agreeable to interview. Well, after this congressional

285
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,720
testimony, I'd like to interview him now, actually interview him in person, because

286
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,520
especially with his testimony, with Lou's media tour, I was kind of worried about

287
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,000
not really being able to approach with fresh questions, because he's kind of answering everything.

288
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,440
He's doing like 50 podcasts, but now I would really like to speak to him and just kind of

289
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:04,320
ask him to expand on some of the things he said and kind of testified to. I think, number one,

290
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,080
and I'm not going to be able to solve this on my platform, but to kind of clear up more issues

291
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,440
around ATIP and OSAP. Yeah. It's like Katsky, Stratton, Kelleher. Everybody's got a little

292
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,880
different bit of a different spin. Eric Davis. Well, they discussed Jay Stratton as well during

293
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,600
the hearings too, and I think he's also coming out with his book imminently, not the name of it,

294
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,400
but it's coming out quite soon. Well, hopefully we can talk to Eric Davis about this next week

295
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,680
at Sol, right? Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Because, first of all, I'd like to thank you

296
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,440
so much, Siwan, for the $5. I really appreciate that. Sol is actually speaking at, or Schrock is

297
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,800
speaking at Sol next week, and he's also doing a Q&A. I believe it's with Eric Davis, right?

298
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,360
Sounds right. Okay, so yeah, there should be some good stuff. Let me go through these,

299
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,400
and we'll keep talking. Django, I love that pig. Thank you so much for the $15,

300
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,640
and Fat Rodents, thank you very much. Does this change what you'll ask at Sol at all?

301
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,040
Well, I'd like to interview some people at Sol, so we'll see what we can do there. I've

302
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,040
talking with Kermit, we're trying to work out some stuff for him to

303
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,560
you know, maybe go in a little bit more on some good camera equipment and actually travel around

304
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,200
to get some good interviews, but not just interviews, right? Like actual documentaries

305
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,720
spliced in with research and so forth, because interviewing Lou, I don't just want to

306
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,480
sit in front of a camera with him for two hours, but add in research. So I'd just like to ask you,

307
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:35,920
Kermit, what would, could you rank in terms of impact and efficacy and just all around feel,

308
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,120
who do you think was the most consequential person to testify to least? And guys in the chat,

309
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,640
give me a one through four, one being the most consequential, four being the least.

310
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:53,120
That's a good question. I'd say probably most consequential. I don't know, my personal

311
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,560
perspective of it is like the questions themselves are the controversial, you know,

312
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,800
that was the provocative stuff. But in terms of people, I would say Gallaudet being there and

313
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,920
being a representative from, you know, the Navy and Noah and being very high up in those positions,

314
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,680
you know, he being a representative of U.S. military and that kind of cohort and then

315
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,240
Elizondo representing military intelligence, Schellenberger being a journalist and then

316
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,800
finally Michael Gold being a scientist, right? So it was like, I felt like the panel overall

317
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,680
was very well stocked and it was diverse and it had all the people that we want to hear from

318
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,520
about this subject. I think Gallaudet was probably, for me, I think that that was probably the most

319
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,760
interesting, like those questions and those answers were probably the most interesting because we've

320
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,360
heard from Lou, you know, from his books and interviews and all this stuff and he does discuss

321
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,600
a lot of it and there was certainly some interesting things discussed today with him,

322
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,720
sorry, yesterday. But I'd say Gallaudet, I also think Michael Gold, I was actually very impressed

323
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,880
with the way that he kind of spoke about it and I think you spoke very positively about just like

324
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,320
NASA collaborating on this in the future and just kind of moving past the stigma that we see with

325
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,360
this topic and just trying to get, you know, the scientific community really to take this

326
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,800
seriously and investigate it. So I would say Gallaudet and Michael Gold were my top two picks.

327
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:19,440
I loved Lou, I loved what he got to say and I really, I was really impressed with the way

328
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,680
that, you know, he presented himself and he was just being very, you know, frank with those

329
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,920
responses as well and, you know, he can't talk outside of, you know, the documents and the

330
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,800
things that he signed and, you know, all that stuff. So, and I know that's frustrating for a lot of

331
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,400
people but I still thought it was very positive. I agree and, you know, I've seen a lot of bitterness

332
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,640
online kind of about the efficacy of the hearings. I agree with everybody that I also expected,

333
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,120
as did Burleson, first-hand retrieval witnesses or first-hand program witnesses.

334
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,720
However, I, yeah, we won't, I'll wait, I'll say that before the interview with Burleson but

335
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,560
just Burleson was expecting other people to testify as well or in place of, we didn't specify

336
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:06,240
about that. But I do think one of the key takeaways here with Immaculate Constellation is

337
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:13,120
kind of an existing proof now of DOD lying about a USAP. You know, the protocol for a USAP and

338
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,680
unacknowledged special access program is deny, deny, deny. They can't even, they can't even say

339
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,080
anything. You know, like even an admission or a denial would like. But if your back's against

340
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,680
the wall then you misinform. That's the protocol. Deny. If you cannot deny anymore, you misinform.

341
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,440
So, I think this was important to see because, you know, there's so many statements from Susan.

342
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,320
Susan Goh is saying Immaculate Constellation is not a program and so forth. I do think the 12-page,

343
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,080
you know, report, which is super interesting, which we'll get into in a little bit. You know,

344
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,560
Kermit and I have been talking at length about one specific report from there and, of course,

345
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,960
the term alien reproduction vehicle, which I kind of got on Schellenberger's a little bit case,

346
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,680
a little bit for omitting from his congressional submission. But he didn't even mention that at

347
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,920
all in his testimony, which I was a little bit disappointed of. And I even asked Jeremy about

348
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,040
that. I said, hey, Jeremy, you know, why didn't he do that? He was like, well, you can just ask

349
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,880
him why they lied. He was too hot under the collar to do that. We'll take a quick break,

350
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,000
look at a couple of questions. What do you think about Nancy May's selling UFO brain

351
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,640
and merch? I think it's a bad taste. Yeah, I will say, you know, seeing kind of the

352
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,440
representatives and how they've kind of been tweeting about this, like that seems positive.

353
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,960
But then, you know, seeing the merch that's being sold, it's just on the nose, you know,

354
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,840
and it's like a UF, it's a shirt of like a UF phone. It's got Nancy May's like in it.

355
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,120
I think it's bad taste. I think it's bad taste. I like this idea a lot, Magic, and I will absolutely

356
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,880
ask him about it. So, okay, what's your guys' thoughts on the simulation hypothesis?

357
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,000
Pretty interesting. Of course, there's a great podcast on the simulation hypothesis that

358
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,560
kind of states that in the future, if the civilization has the computing power to conduct

359
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,640
a simulation of a whole hypothesis, that means they won't just stop at one simulation. They

360
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,160
will conduct numerous, possibly even infinite. And therefore, if there's infinite simulated

361
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,120
hypotheses of universes in the future that yours is statistically more likely to be a simulated

362
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,960
one. It's interesting, but, you know, I can't prove it. What do you say, Kerm?

363
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,840
It's just too much bandwidth for me, man. I just show me an Excel file.

364
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,120
He likes money. Yeah, he likes money. I'm into the credits. Show me a 10K. I mean,

365
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,800
it's not, I wouldn't be surprised if that's, like, I feel like what Grush said last year,

366
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,160
I think, is a pretty good, pretty good description. Holographic.

367
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,320
Yeah, he's just like, whatever, he kind of had this line where he's like, you know,

368
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,360
you kind of look in places in the universe. It seems like things are just a little too

369
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,800
perfect. You know what I mean? And, you know, I don't know. I feel like that's kind of where I

370
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,400
kind of stand with this. Like, you know, the more we kind of understand the world around us,

371
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,120
it's like we really get to understand, like, why we're here and, like, what's the nature of existence.

372
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,320
And yeah, what's interesting, though, is, you know, Rizwan Burke, he's going to be at the,

373
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,320
he's going to be at Seoul, and he's going to give a discussion about the simulation.

374
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,960
Ooh, that's going to be, we'll have to talk about that post.

375
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,320
He also on Joe Rogan said he knew people in the legacy program as well.

376
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,600
Diddy. Okay, we'll have to talk about that as well. So, Schellenberger, Lou, Gallaudet,

377
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,160
and Gold, I think it was an extremely poor taste for Higgins or whoever it was that

378
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,440
was trying to burn Schellenberger's whistleblower. Yeah, I wasn't, I don't know. I thought,

379
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,560
I thought Higgins' line of questioning was like kind of half-baked a little bit. And I get,

380
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,080
yeah, I get that you guys are trying to figure out what the source is. But like, at the end of

381
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,480
the day, Schellenberger was literally said he was willing to go to jail to protect that source.

382
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,800
So, you just got to respect that. So, Siwon, thank you again for the next five bucks, man.

383
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:40,080
Yeah, Schrock. So, isn't just a former director of Skunkworks on the USAF advisory board. He

384
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,280
probably did about know about the OSAP transfer. So, I really hope we can hear about that at Seoul.

385
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,840
So, it would be very interesting to hear from him next week.

386
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,560
Gold, Schellenberger, Gallaudet, Elizondo. I know something or someone, I know you're not the

387
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:58,080
biggest Elizondo proponent. The thing that worried me the most about Gallaudet speaking

388
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,880
was kind of reinforced. First of all, I loved Tim Gallaudet. Hermit can see, Tim's my boy,

389
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,440
we spoke quite a bit. Super nice guy. I've talked to him a lot before he had seen the channel with

390
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,960
the USO videos. But I was worried because when Chris Sharpe's reporting on Neuro and undersea

391
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,280
crash retrievals came out with Wood Soul Ocean, a graphic institute, and Lockheed Martin Drys

392
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,120
Immersible, I reached out to Gallaudet and I just said, hey, sir, can we talk about these

393
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,920
underwater crash retrievals? And he told me, I don't know anything about it. And at that point,

394
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:40,160
I rationed, okay, he's bound by NDA. He can't speak about this. It makes sense. I'll back off.

395
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,800
But then, of course, at the hearing, he said he'd never signed an NDA towards anything.

396
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,240
He did say that. Yeah.

397
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,640
That does worry me a little bit. He doesn't know about USO retrievals. Harry, thank you very much.

398
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,320
Who was your favorite during the breaks, meetups, and formal chats?

399
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,480
Probably Burleson, to be honest.

400
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,440
Yeah, I thought our conversation with Burleson, post hearing. And then he was also at the UAPDF,

401
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,160
post party as well. We got some FaceTime there as well.

402
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,000
It was really great talking to him. He's a sharp cat. We also got to talk to numerous house staffers

403
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,920
as well. Oh, yeah. We'll get into that once we finish up the hearings. But we'll just say for

404
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,720
now, we got a lot of business cards, which was great. Contact information was exchanged.

405
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,440
Okay. Jim Chu says, on what impact, if any, will Trump have on deeper disclosure?

406
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,560
I already think that he's making consequential moves by placing men like Rubio in power, which

407
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,360
Rubio, of course, has been trying to subpoena and interview witnesses since at least 2008.

408
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,480
And Matt Gaetz being the attorney general, that was just announced today. I think that's

409
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,720
significant. I think he's setting up a pretty pro-disclosure cabinet.

410
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,080
I know there's been a lot of talks as well with this Department of Government Efficiency,

411
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,320
which seems to be more and more like a real thing. Elon Musk, Vivek, Rama Swamy, if you guys are

412
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,400
watching this stream, I would love to join the effort in specifically trying to audit this

413
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:04,240
legacy program activity. Hey, let's get this man in doge. That'd be pretty cool. So what stuck out

414
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,120
to Throsey here was the idea of tracking ARVs. This implies that foreign ARVs are uncontrolled,

415
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,840
domestic ARVs. I think both probably remember, this is something that even Congress really got

416
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:24,080
wrong. Immaculate Constellation is not a legacy program. This was made in 2017 in an attempt to,

417
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:31,600
I guess, umbrella over both legacy program and UAP. And it happened concurrent with Lou Elizondo

418
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,720
coming out public with the New York Times order. So Immaculate Constellation would not have

419
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,080
access. Members of Immaculate Constellation would not have read-on access to, let's say,

420
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,840
the Air Force legacy program that tests ARV crap. Possibly. I mean, we don't really know how

421
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:55,120
consolidated those databases are because it does talk about, I think, the overall structure of

422
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,080
Immaculate Constellation is like a reporting. So it gets these UFO reports, this raw data that's

423
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:05,200
coming in, and it silos it based on the imagery and the intelligence that they have behind that.

424
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,840
So does that database also include stuff pre-2017? Well, I don't really know. But what I will say is,

425
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,680
within the Immaculate Constellation report, this 11-page report, it does talk about imagery and

426
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,800
human intelligence reports. And the scope of those encounters goes back to 1991. So that's

427
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,920
pre-2017. So does Immaculate Constellation have that pre-2017 data? Maybe. It just really depends

428
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,000
on what this author of this document had access to. And if it was all IC, Immaculate Constellation.

429
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,840
Maybe. But I've also asked some of my friends who are analysts in satellite industry, so they

430
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,640
could look back to 1974 for the Koyama incident, and they said, that's too far back. We have a cutoff.

431
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:56,240
So I think for some of these space-based systems, that data is just not available.

432
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,120
But I also do think that the programs are even between Army, Navy, and Air Force,

433
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,840
probably the three largest legacy programs, that there's very little communication or cross-referencing

434
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:14,960
between those programs. So it'd be interesting to find out who the witness of Schellenberger is,

435
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,200
and who ran the Immaculate Constellation program. It was said that this was an individual in the

436
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,400
executive branch. Possibly State Department. Possibly State Department. That's at least

437
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,560
the witness, I think, Ross Goldhart has said. I think so. But I am of the mind that there are

438
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,960
domestic ARBs that probably even the executive branch and Immaculate Constellation has no idea

439
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,760
about. Yeah, but also I think probably the most interesting part is that we do have foreign

440
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,200
intelligence of foreign ARBs, and those are included within the Immaculate Constellation

441
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,040
report. And we have imagery and videos of this stuff. Specifically of the case that occurred

442
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,960
over the Indo-Pacific region of a large black triangle, which if that's the case, you know,

443
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,640
we were just at the Spy Museum and we saw some imagery of China ripping off and reverse

444
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,640
engineering a predator drone. This would also mean that China ripped off and reverse engineered a

445
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,760
TR3D. Hey, I do the same thing all the time. Kermit, here's a question for you, sir. There was

446
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,040
some speculation regarding the involvement of Pacific architects and engineers outbidding

447
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,280
OSAP for the locking materials. Anything there? That's a great question. Yeah, I so I've been

448
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,960
referred to Pacific architects and engineers quite some times. As I understand it, they were later

449
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:36,000
required by Lockheed Martin, I think. Yeah, I haven't really looked into it a ton. I know that

450
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,320
they did become involved like post OSAP trans like that same timeline still exists. So very

451
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,000
interesting, but I will say I think it's a fairly small organization. Like it's mostly like an

452
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,880
engineering consulting services group that's I think less than a thousand, five thousand employees.

453
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,360
I could be completely wrong here. But yeah, no, I know I know the name Pacific architects. I don't

454
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:05,120
know a ton about it. But yeah, I'll just nod my head and smile. That just means follow up research.

455
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:11,280
So that's awesome. Trump could pardon Trump could pardon anyone under UAP non-disclosure.

456
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,680
I think amnesty should be truth and reconciliation. Yeah, truth. Unless it's a it's like a person

457
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,880
that has killed somebody for the sake of secrecy. Yeah, like if these are not, I don't know. I don't

458
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,400
even know if like the JSOC members in the 2004, if that's a true case, the blue on blue JSOC,

459
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,160
we've been killed by Lockheed retrieval members, if that's a true case, and those guys are acting

460
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,880
under strict orders. But I don't know if if you're a men in black assassin trying to who visited

461
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,680
Mark McCandless's house in 2021, I don't know how much you should receive amnesty.

462
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,880
It feels almost like it would be almost like a military version of a record case, right? Because

463
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,520
it's like you have all these people working on these different programs following orders. But at

464
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,680
the end of the day, who's really making decisions? So if you really want like full disclosure, truth

465
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,800
and reconciliation, sending people to jail as well for, you know, illegal activity, I feel like

466
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,120
the ultimate responsibility is like the people, you know, Depsec, whatever, that are in these

467
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:10,080
high up positions making these orders, right? So who ultimately is responsible for that? I don't

468
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,360
know. We don't know. We're still trying to figure that out. Maybe it's Cheney. He should have been

469
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,680
in jail a long time ago. He's probably sits at the top of the pyramid. So Mace is a grifter. I'd

470
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,200
like to get your opinion on this. I think she's more of just an opportunist who doesn't really

471
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,560
understand maybe some context around UFOs and kind of the disinformating cartoonists and grifters,

472
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,680
if you want to call him that. So I understand like calling calling grifter just from seeing the

473
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,600
shirt. I totally understand it. But okay, calling calling Mace a grifter. I just I think it's just

474
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,320
the poor taste of her. Yeah, it's just poor. I think it's just poor taste. And honestly, I think

475
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,200
it's probably like a staffer or something. Yeah. That's, Hey, you know, we're trying to have some

476
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,920
UFO brain and merch out there so that, you know, our constituents know, you know, this is this will

477
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,480
be. Yeah. So Siwan, thank you again. You talked to a staffer at that the committee had heard about

478
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,840
Schrock and his story. Not sure why he didn't testify. I was thinking, yeah, once I once I'd

479
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,640
saw a truck was going to talk at Seoul, I was assuming he was going to be one of the witnesses

480
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,880
today. That was very surprising for me. So one of the things at Seoul is there's some time for

481
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,360
meet and greets and so forth along with the Q&A. So we will I promise you try and pull Schrock for

482
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:27,760
an interview. I would do anything for that. So we'll scroll down here. So this is talking a little

483
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,000
bit throws. He's talking a little bit more about Mace. They're selling a platform for fundraising

484
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,560
for Republicans. But yes, bad taste. Okay. We all agree there. So here's a question or statement

485
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,800
from Hokey. It would be interesting for you to talk with the lawyer in the military space. What

486
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,440
are the potential legal mechanisms? 1950s era executive orders, DOE exceptions that could keep

487
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,640
this hushed up. I didn't like being a good person to us to talk to. Yeah. And then also, I mean,

488
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,880
this is, I mean, at least in the legal financial area, right? Like there's a bunch of stuff in,

489
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,960
you know, the SEC Act, the Code of Federal Regulations that allow not just for like the

490
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,720
president, but also like to your point, right, Department of Energy, they can provide like

491
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,720
the executive agencies can provide these exemptions specifically for corporations or people or

492
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,680
agencies that are involved in, you know, above black or above board activities like that.

493
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,040
So I'm just trying to look at the questions because then we'll get back to the hearings.

494
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,320
So Nell, I only heard from the disclosure Mike account, and he was also talking about other

495
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,160
witnesses, like firsthand triangle witnesses. So maybe this was, maybe his sources

496
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,160
were a little bit behind. Maybe there was something that was supposed to happen. But

497
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,560
no, I personally heard none of Nell supposing to have testified. Yeah. I'd like to, I'd like to

498
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,280
hear him. Okay. Sorry. Okay. A question about Michael, does he know when he'll be able to go

499
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:58,160
back to the black side? I do not know. I have no idea. Michael used to work at Bigelow and that

500
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,960
wasn't mentioned in his bio. Also NASA is the, yeah, I've ever worked for NASA is not transparent.

501
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,480
I can give you guys, I mean, I think I've talked about it multiple times, like in the Moon dust

502
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:13,200
video where NASA has lied. Anyone see SAIC took its biggest one day loss today? No, actually,

503
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,000
today, today with post earnings, what's going on here? Oh no. I don't know. Yeah. Well,

504
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,080
let Kermit pull that up while I get, while I get the next question. The one day we go run the streets

505
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:28,720
looking at museums, the SAIC tanks. How did I have such a great seat? I had a good friend who

506
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,720
helped me get media for this really good friend. I'm very thankful too. And so I owe all of that

507
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,360
to that, that person. Have you guys read the 11 page paper? Yes, we're about to talk about it too

508
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:50,800
once we finish up with the hearings as well. Okay, let's see. Eli, shout out event horizon.

509
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,360
It's not just at SAIC. It's actually a, so what's going on with SAIC is actually being seen at

510
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:02,720
Litos, Amentum and a couple other defense primes. It seems to be some type of uncertainty in the

511
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,440
defense market at its current, at this current moment. I wonder what's causing that. I wonder

512
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,080
what's causing that. I'm just looking for, for triangles. Siwon, thank you. You are giving a

513
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:20,000
lot of cash. Thank you so much, man. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. Thank you

514
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,800
as well, Jimmy Shoe. I'm looking for questions right now, guys. Yeah, I think I saw this as

515
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,480
well to Douglas Dean Johnson and Kirkpatrick provided several points too. I don't know,

516
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,200
Debunk, I think he might have raised some interesting points. I haven't fully read what,

517
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:42,400
what he said. Yeah, so his, his belief, right, I think it's kind of just scrutinizing and assessing

518
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,400
this document, right? So first off, this is written by somebody in the Department of Defense and then

519
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,440
was approved by the Department of State Public Affairs. Kirkpatrick basically said in his response,

520
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,920
this is completely bogus. This is completely made up. This isn't what happens. Not to mention,

521
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,360
this 11 page document is not on any official letterhead. It does not seem to be any sort of like,

522
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,720
formalized or standard report memo. Otherwise, it's coming out officially of an agency. This

523
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,000
seems like, I don't know, like it could be somebody typing up this report. Is this somebody in the

524
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,840
government? Is this somebody that's not in the government? Ultimately, we don't, we don't really

525
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:25,040
entirely know, but I think some of the things that we would expect from government documents are

526
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,440
absent from this 11 page report. And then especially now that it's been entered into the

527
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,720
congressional record and everyone's kind of talking about it, it's like, obviously, the

528
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:39,600
scrutiny has just increased. Yeah. Yeah. So how did the panel get selected? Felt more like a

529
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,960
variety show, which I agree with you. I have no idea how the panel got selected. All I know is

530
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,680
that for this hearing specifically from Burleson, as well as a person I talked to connected with

531
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,040
the intelligence community at the UAPDF, there have been other instances where witnesses were

532
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,960
intimidated almost like up to the time they were supposed to, supposed to testify. So, you know,

533
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,760
I'm not exactly sure the issues here, but I don't know how this was selected. I mean, I

534
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,360
probably would have chosen a little bit of a different lineup or possibly even more witnesses,

535
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,560
but, you know, I'm not necessarily sure. I felt like they did a good job just, again, kind of

536
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,400
selecting a group of people that kind of represented different aspects kind of of this. And you have

537
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,840
like naval intelligence, you know, journalism, science. I thought that that was a pretty good

538
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,480
mix of people. Right. I do think that the hearings were varied enough from last years.

539
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:40,480
However, we need first-hand, not first-hand experiencers, but first-hand whistleblowers

540
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,080
involved. Like touch the craft. You've been in the basement, you've seen the stuff. Yes.

541
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:50,320
But I don't know, saying you've seen the stuff, mentioning the technologies and mentioning the

542
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,880
locations would then be violating your special access programs that you've been read into in

543
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,720
legacy. So the consequences for that would likely be severe. Yeah. And I imagine those are the type

544
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,560
of people that would be told on their way to testify, to turn back or bad things will happen.

545
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,800
Yeah, that could be happening. Crackerjack, thank you so much for the 20 big month. It is a big

546
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,720
month. We got a lot of stuff and we still got soul coming up. Traveling across the country for UAPs.

547
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,560
So, sorry, I'm just looking at, did you already talk about the Kuwait UAP that

548
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,600
Sheldon Berger mentioned? Not yet, which we will. I'd also, in the report, which I thought was

549
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,560
interesting, was the mention of the Orbs flying circles around the F-22s, right?

550
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:41,600
Yep. And then also, I think that same incident at the Orbs escorted the F-22 out of the

551
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,800
missionary. So this pilot is on their way to do this mission. And then all of a sudden,

552
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,200
they get surrounded by Orbs that are doing all these tricks around it. And then the Orbs are

553
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,000
like, get out. As I was reading that report, I'm just trying to picture it for myself. I'm like,

554
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,720
that's got to be airing on. And that reminds me of the Donald Trump on JRE, who talks about speaking

555
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:11,760
to F-22 pilots who observe. Yeah, specifically F-22. So do those correlate? I don't think it's

556
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,320
a stretch to say yes. William, I've been awesome, man. How are you doing? Sorry I've been a little

557
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:21,520
dark between Jesse and this and soul has so much going on. I do have a project coming out and it

558
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:27,520
should be within the week that I'm really excited. Really excited. Yes, we talked about this. It

559
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,120
appears the report came from Corbell, not Schellenberger. A lot of drama around there.

560
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,560
Schellenberger just had an interview with Jesse. I haven't had the opportunity to watch it yet,

561
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,200
but I would like to see that. I would like to see that. So let me just look for questions here,

562
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,520
guys, so then we'll keep talking. You guys asked so many great questions, especially the stuff

563
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,040
of current. Keep them coming. So yeah. Have you seen the Beyond Paradigm podcast with putoff and

564
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,520
graves? Do you think that it's important that somebody who just worked with putoff just testified?

565
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,680
I have not seen the podcast with putoff and graves. Have you? I would like to watch it though,

566
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,680
because we've got to meet Ryan Graves as well, and he's extremely kind. What's the chatter with

567
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:12,560
the grush op-ed? Well, Burleson will make some comments on it, but he thought the reason as to

568
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:18,480
why the American public has not seen it yet was not his place to say, but he did have some comments

569
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,680
on it, which is pretty interesting. Okay, perfect. Thank you for putting the question. How was the

570
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,160
UAPDF dinner? Any key points there that caught your attention? Did congressional individuals and

571
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:36,720
staffer show interest? Thank you. That's a perfect segue question. So Lester Nair, guys, if you guys,

572
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,000
you guys probably all know Lester Nair. If you don't, I'd really follow him. He's a member of UAP

573
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,120
Caucus, brilliant individual. This morning he tweeted, I have a lot of thoughts about yesterday.

574
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,200
I'll just start with saying being here in person is like seeing the situation in full color,

575
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,600
watching only the hearings and not all the things happening in real life before and

576
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:01,120
after around it. It's like watching it in black and white. And this is a statement we've talked

577
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,920
about. I couldn't agree more with guys. The hearings were good. I love the time there,

578
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:16,080
but I was blown away by UAPDF. Seeing the House and congressional interest and support from both

579
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:22,240
Republicans and Democrats, seeing the unity around some individuals, seeing members connected

580
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,960
with the intelligence community. There were numerous staffers as well that we just talked about that

581
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,640
Kermit and I connected with a lot of business cards to speak to staffers who are really

582
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:39,200
interested in the subject. And I'll keep going on, but give me your thoughts on UAPDF.

583
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,040
Yeah. First off, I just want to say Lester Nair, thank you kindly for letting us in.

584
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:51,600
It was extraordinary just to be able to just be amongst everybody and just have the opportunity

585
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,960
just to be able to attend and get to talk to everybody. Yeah. I mean, pretty much a lot

586
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,400
of the witnesses were there. A lot of people around them, Ryan Graves, who attended the

587
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:05,680
hearings and was also at the UAPDF. And then some of the representatives, Senator Rounds,

588
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,120
gave the opening address and actually awarded Lou Elizondo a framed copy of the legislation

589
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:17,760
that was cool to the NDAA last year, which I think that that speaks volumes to the support and

590
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:24,160
just the persistence, just kind of the persistence that Senator Rounds and these people in Congress

591
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,680
have about really trying to get transparency and enacting legislation to get that. And none of them

592
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:36,560
are like, like none of them are kooky or dubious characters as Green Street would say. Burrelson

593
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:41,280
went on stage. He said, guys, like I've said this before, I'll say it again. I'm skeptic about

594
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:47,760
everything. But there's obvious blockages here from places outside of Congress. And I want to

595
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,080
get to the bottom of this and so forth. So these guys are all saying that they don't have all the

596
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:58,000
pieces, but they're pretty darn open-minded. We'll just say Burrelson has not been at rest

597
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,920
since Brush spoke last year. He has not been just relaxing and chilling. Either has Birchette

598
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:10,480
and other people. We got the board of directors for the UAP-DF, including Gary Nolan, Nell and

599
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,720
Elizondo, the advisory board, Timothy Gallaudet, Chris Mellon, Kirk McConnell. Interesting about

600
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:22,320
Chris Mellon. We went to the art museum today and the Mellon family donated all of the best

601
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:28,240
pieces there. Substantially all, yeah. And we got a document here, an actual picture of the six

602
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:35,120
observables of UAP craft, including positive lift, hypersonic velocities, instantaneous acceleration,

603
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:40,400
low observability, trans-medium travel and biological effects. But what I would just like

604
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,480
to say about the UAP-DF is there were some individuals there that I have wanted to connect to

605
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:52,400
for a very long time that I finally got the chance to sit and speak with. And I couldn't be happier.

606
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,160
So do we want to talk about, I guess, our conversation with Leslie?

607
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll talk about Leslie Kane a little bit.

608
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. How was that conversation?

609
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:07,760
So for the Brad Swarinson ARV project, analyzing emails and transcripts, I found one mention

610
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,080
that between 2000 and 2003, Mark had sent Leslie Kane a copy of Fluxliner as drawn by Brad.

611
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,000
And so I bring this up to Leslie Kane and she couldn't remember it because at that time she

612
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,560
was working with Greer. She didn't talk to McCandlishe after 2004 when she left with Greer,

613
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:31,840
didn't know all about that. And so asked me to explain. And Leslie Kane kind of had no idea of

614
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,880
the Brad Swarinson interview with Aviation Week in Space Technology. And so Shera and I were

615
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,480
talking for like 10 minutes straight. She was gobsmacked about the death threats from Swarinson.

616
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,480
She couldn't believe it. But then she and I were talking about that. We were talking about the

617
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,800
Edwards case and Wittness Ed, Kexburg as well. And Leslie Kane is just one of the smartest,

618
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,080
nicest people I've ever spoken to. There was a group of journalists nearby. I sat near them at

619
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,480
the press conference and they were kind of hounding around, really nice people kind of

620
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,400
wanting to get a picture of what was going on. So then afterwards they talked to me for like 30

621
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,720
minutes on how I source methods. But Leslie Kane was so cool to talk to. She's so small and she's

622
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,520
so cute with her like, gray hair that's puffing out in every direction. It was, it was really

623
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:23,600
fantastic just watching y'all both just go and add it on Kexburg and Torrance and it was just,

624
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,280
it was like a meeting of the minds and I was just like, I was just blessed just to like sit and watch

625
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,000
it, you know? Because she stepped away from the case for a while. I think with, I think with a lot

626
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,120
of journalists, and it makes sense, right? When you have to, you know, meet a quota for maybe a

627
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,280
publication or some forth, at some point, you got to step away from the case. Yeah. And so with

628
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,840
Kexburg, you know, Kexburg, I think she hit a dead end, which I understand too, because I also told

629
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:51,120
her about kind of Romansky and some of the FOIA dead ends with talking to his kids who he mentioned

630
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:59,360
on the Jim Montell show, words of night access to, or told not to speak about Romansky. So in my

631
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,760
opinion, Kexburg has hit someone of a dead end, but, you know, her eyes kind of lit up when I told

632
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,640
her about the Sorens and stuff, because, you know, that case really is alive and well, especially

633
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,680
with ARV and Immaculate Constellation. But yeah, I mean, it's made the new cycle yet again. And as

634
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:20,240
we know, this, the, the McCandler Sorens and Story is one of the original like sources of the ARV

635
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:25,600
reproduction vehicle concept. So, you know, if we, if, if we really want to understand the

636
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:31,040
ARV and the RV, man, like we need to, we need to, we need, I don't know, we need to drag people in

637
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,480
and start getting them testified. Well, and I really need to stress this, because I think Corbell

638
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,320
and Knapp discussed this as well as some others. The term, excuse me, ARV did not originate with

639
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:49,200
Greer. This UFO researcher, Bill Hamilton was the first person to ever speak about ARV. And this

640
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:55,520
term was given to him by Brad and Bill Scott. And in 1991, he was the first one to publish

641
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,560
the term ARV to text unrelated to the story. I think he made a misprint here. He called it an

642
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:05,760
alien replicated vehicle, not alien reproduction vehicle, but use the term ARV. And so in my tweet

643
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,120
where I kind of called out Schellenberger a little bit for saying, Hey, why did you take this out?

644
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:15,440
It's because ARV is not attributing alien and extra terrestrials to this vehicle. ARV is the

645
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,400
specific term. It's like the brand name, like Sprite to lemon line soda that Brad Sorensen was

646
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,480
told by the individual showing off the craft at Northern Air Force Base, which is a story, I

647
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,400
believe to be true. ARV specifically was said, these are alien reproduction vehicles. So, you know,

648
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,560
by saying alien reproduction vehicle, it's not just extraterrestrial. It's a, I hate to use this

649
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:40,080
word because I think it's overused, but it is a kind of a nuance term, right? Yeah. But so Leslie

650
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:46,160
Kane, I'm sending her some of the ARV stuff and she and I are going to get cracking and talk a

651
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,400
little bit more about that. So it's exciting. If I could get her on the show or talk to her,

652
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,600
because we were waiting for like 20 minutes to speak to her. There were some

653
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,840
chatty Cathy speaking to her right before we got up. And it's okay. I mean, for some

654
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:06,160
people like us, it's, it's a little shocking to be in kind of a mixture with

655
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,920
some of the people we were around. Yeah, I would say overall, it just felt very surreal. I mean,

656
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,840
for me, you know, this is, I guess the first time I've come out and like, Hey, I'm Kermit,

657
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,400
I'm probably probably about years or whatever. And then also just seeing a lot of people that

658
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,760
have been like following and talking with like on Twitter, Reddit, you know, all these different

659
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:30,400
social media platforms and then seeing a lot of those people in person. And then like,

660
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,800
you know, the UAPDF party, it's like, you know, who are kind of worried if we weren't, if we're

661
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,960
going to get in or not, it was all this, you know, kind of anxiety about it. And then just being in

662
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,040
the room, it was like, at first part, I was just like anxious because I'm like, geez, like, I'm so

663
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:49,680
out of place. But I also just felt like just so happy and just so blessed just to like have, have

664
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,320
that experience. Everybody there was brilliant. Everybody there had something to offer and talk

665
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:59,440
about. And it was just a really special group of people. It was really darn cool. Absolutely.

666
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,520
And it was really cool. I also, we got to talk to James Fox quite a bit as well.

667
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,080
Really excited for the program. We're going to see that next week at Sol. But

668
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:14,400
James Fox is one cool dude out on Apple TV, November, December 15. I think so. He is one

669
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,920
cool dude guys. James Fox is awesome to talk to. Yep. We were, yeah, we, we talked a lot about

670
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:27,120
that. And then also just going to Sol and, you know, just his doc, like his, his work with Virginia

671
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:33,040
a little bit as well. So fantastic guy. I would say a lot of the people that we met yesterday

672
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:38,480
were very nice. You know, they're very interested in talking to us and learning from our perspective

673
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,280
and our experience and kind of like, you know, our reason, our why of like being this topic. So

674
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,440
I found it pretty cool because I find as like a content creator in the sphere, there's a lot of

675
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,840
like hoarding of information, I would say, and kind of unwillingness to share and collaborate.

676
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:57,680
So being around this group of people who are just so willing to speak and talk was, was really

677
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,520
cool. You know, so many people asked me like, who do I work for? They say nobody. I, you know,

678
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,000
I work for myself. I'm just here because I'm intellectually curious about aliens. Yeah.

679
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,640
Some people would kind of give a look at like, really? Yeah. Like Burlton asked me that and I

680
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:16,000
just know like I'm self published. I just create documentaries. And so that was, that was really

681
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,600
cool guys. I'm on a first name basis with Rhett Burlton. Did you notice the witnesses were as

682
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:25,200
nervous in person as they appeared on TV? I understand it's a nerve wracking situation,

683
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,000
but they seem very nervous. To me, they did not look nervous at all. The most nervous person was

684
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,560
Jeremy Cordell. I wasn't in the room. So I wouldn't know. I will say, I mean, they didn't seem nervous

685
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:41,360
at least when I got to meet a lot of them at the UAPDF. You know, if these people are all engaged

686
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,240
in some massive psychological operation, they're doing a really, really good job of it. Because

687
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,160
it did not seem like they were engaged in fraud or anything like that. And I think Michael Gold

688
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:55,200
had one heck of a time because he was a, he was just kind of eating candy the whole time. And

689
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:01,600
then afterwards I got to speak to him and he was just so, he was like all smiles that he got to

690
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:08,080
talk. So, you know, it's always nice meeting the men behind the mics and talking to these people.

691
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:14,240
Well, I mean, there's certainly, I had been a little harsh, I think, on loot lately with some of

692
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:20,560
the presentation stuff and just sort of the questions that still remain and are really

693
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:25,200
valid about his background, as well as his work at CIFA, the Counterintelligence Field Activity.

694
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:33,040
But, you know, meeting and talking to these people was really great. So, yes, okay.

695
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,000
While this part was people reporting loss of time and feelings of unease, let's remember the story

696
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,880
of Jonathan Wagan, who in 1997 in Peru, when he and his fellow Marines allegedly found a crash

697
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,960
saucer as they got within close proximity, they felt like intense fear and unease. And, you know,

698
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,120
if the infographics whistleblower story is true, crash retrieval operators have to have

699
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:59,360
grounding mechanisms because your cognition is so affected. Well, it's a, yeah, I've heard from

700
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:03,920
other people's experiences as well that loss of time is actually quite common. I think there's

701
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,640
something to do with the warping of gravity and time and just how that affects our perception.

702
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,440
That definitely tracks. There's another point I was going to say to that, but I'm completely

703
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:20,320
blanking on it. Is it about fear or? Fear. Oh, actually, what I was going to say is, you know,

704
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:25,040
actually, the loss of time is also featured in the X-Files, too. Whenever Fox Motor, whenever he has

705
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,200
these encounters, if you see his, you know, extraterrestrial vehicle, he'll check his

706
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,200
watch because he's trying to see if the, you know, the timer's gone. So I don't know. I, I, I

707
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,880
sort of watched the X-Files after I really started getting into UAPs and I'm like,

708
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,200
interesting. Like, this is talking, this is a lot of the stuff I've been like researching it.

709
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,160
This is a little on the nose. X-Files is a big thing. What's going on?

710
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,960
And I'll talk about one very specific thing in the X-Files in my next video. How much of the

711
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,320
UAP topic occupies your daily life researching, editing? If I'm not with the girlfriend talking

712
01:00:54,320 --> 01:01:00,960
to Kermit on the phone, training Jiu Jitsu, lifting weights or doing other work, I'm doing this. So

713
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:07,760
and I know you didn't ask me, but what I will say is it's probably, it is my, it is my intellectual

714
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:14,640
curiosity. So after, after work, after dinner, after I'm done hanging out with my friends and

715
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:21,120
watching Instagram reels, I'm scrolling the CIA's reading room and the Navy's reading room as well.

716
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:28,320
Yeah. So yeah, I mean, I'll say if I'm not, this takes up probably most of my time outside the

717
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:34,080
lady. I always have like nine or 10 PDFs. I'm reading escape velocity. Thank you so much.

718
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,720
This is for our, oh, thank you. Let's catch up soon. Absolutely. Thank you so much.

719
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,280
I appreciate it, man. I appreciate it a lot. And yes, sorry I missed your call today. It's been

720
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:50,560
hectic as been very hectic, dude, but thank you so much. Levi, it was nice to meet you too, man.

721
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,760
Wanted to ask if you got any impressions hearing roundspeak at the UAPDA would be

722
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,520
reintroduced independently. I wouldn't be surprised. He mentioned it a couple of times.

723
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,920
There seems to be very strong support. Yeah.

724
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,120
To reintroduce seems to be a little bit of spite that it wasn't passed.

725
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,240
Yeah. He seemed pretty unhappy. So it was mentioned a lot.

726
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:14,560
So Juan, thank you again, dude. Holy cow. Do you believe SSCI know some UAPs are NHI and are aware

727
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:22,320
of the legacy program? Senate probably. Yeah. Senate probably. Especially

728
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,880
House, I think like a house is really still trying to get answers on this. But as far as we know,

729
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:35,360
Senate has been on this trail. Like they had almost a year, a six months to a year head start

730
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,160
over the house and their investigations. Yeah. That's at least what I was told.

731
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:45,040
Okay. This is a good question. What alleged NHI technology would you both like to most know

732
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:51,840
everything about things? I would like, I don't, that's actually a tough one. I've grappled with

733
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:56,880
this question a lot. So I'll let you go first, Grimmit. You just throw me the. Yeah, you go first, man.

734
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,920
I want to, I think the electrogravity is probably the first thing I want to look at.

735
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,280
I want to, I just, I just want to know like if it was actually a thing, you know, also just by the

736
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:15,280
way, like, come on. So the B2, I don't know if you guys know this, but the B2 has a technology on

737
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,960
board. I think it's called the inertial mass reduction or something like that. Basically,

738
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,560
it uses like electromagnetic, like high voltage electricity through the wings to reduce the

739
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:29,840
weight of the airframe. So it's like less, less, less heavy in the air. So it's a little bit more

740
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,880
maneuverable. I just think that's very interesting, you know, up to I think, and that's basically

741
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,840
electrogravity. If you want to, if you want to kind of think about it like that. I mean,

742
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,880
I'm not a scientist. Again, I'm going to count it. But that's probably one of the first things I

743
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,000
would be interested in. I'd say novel propulsion and then energy would be the next one. Like how,

744
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,640
how is that propulsion like being energized? That's kind of one and two for me.

745
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:58,560
So specific technology, because I can't really go with the craft, I would like to know

746
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:03,600
about the piece of technology that RA described that was the weapons technology.

747
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,560
The tablet?

748
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:08,320
Yes. That was showing the symbology. He didn't know if it was in his head or not.

749
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,280
So that, that would, that would be one of mine.

750
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:19,120
Sorry. Sorry, getting through these and I'm going through. Thank you. Will be Milo. Pretty

751
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:24,960
impressive. You are pretty impressive. Thank you so much. And so one again. Thank you, dude. Holy

752
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,280
cow. And Chris Sharp collab would go insane. Well, you know, Chris Sharp wasn't there,

753
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,160
but I got to make a heck of a lot of connections. So I would love to talk crash retrievals with

754
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:39,680
Sharp. In fact, you know, I'd like to meet him in person. So, you know, maybe we'll get a London

755
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:48,000
trip going in because I'd really like to meet him. UAP is across the pond. So JC was not testifying.

756
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,200
That is an interesting observation. Why would he be nervous? I don't know, but he just, when I was

757
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,200
talking to him before the hearings, he was just like, okay, now I need to center myself a little bit.

758
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,680
So. Oh, okay. I just, I didn't, I didn't know what JC was at first.

759
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:07,200
Did you talk with anyone about remote viewing? Yeah, quite a bit. Specifically, Chris from

760
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:14,160
Area 52 channel. He was with, he's really cool, by the way. You got to talk to him too from Area 52.

761
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,640
He actually says he has had experience with remote viewing. So I'm going to link up and talk with him

762
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,520
and, you know, see if he can do some, some sort of demonstrations or proof of concept because,

763
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:27,520
you know, I'm sure you feel kind of the same, same way as me, but this is one of the toughest

764
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,520
things for me to grab my head around and grapple just because I'm so unfamiliar with the topic.

765
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,960
Yeah. The only time it was really discussed was kind of talking about like Ed May's work in the

766
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,280
1990s and how that got transferred into that certain private corporation that we're interested in.

767
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,480
Was it Mays or Luna that also talked about craft flown with mind?

768
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:50,880
Bind body. That was craft connection. Luna, I think was mind body. She said it was a mind

769
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,680
body connection. That was interesting. That was very interesting. Okay. This is just a comment.

770
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,840
Diana Posolka said on a pod, Tim Taylor, AKA Tyler told her ex files had real consultants from the

771
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:06,720
program. Yep. Yeah. I would agree. I would agree with this. Holy crap. Snapple. Thank you so much.

772
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,320
BJJ practitioners. Where do you train? I mean, that is just so kind of you. Thank you. I'll be

773
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:18,560
sharing this loop with my boy Kermit here. Thank you so much. Sorry. I'm just looking at, okay,

774
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,720
questions. Yes. Thank you guys. What actions moving forward? Are you guys looking for Congress to

775
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:27,200
take and what would indicate action on the information to discuss discussed in this hearing?

776
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,080
That's a great question. For me specifically, what actions moving forward? Witnesses need to

777
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:37,520
be subpoenaed and this needs to be done in a setting outside of Arrow. I spoke with Burleson

778
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:44,560
about this and there are witnesses. I have talked about publicly and not publicly that

779
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:51,840
information has been passed on for him to get subpoenaed. Yeah. I feel like the more interesting

780
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,600
people to talk to at this point are the ones that are not going to be super cooperative because

781
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,280
I think the majority of them are probably a little bit more in the know than people that

782
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:05,120
are more transparent about this. That's just my take on this. I also want to see Congress

783
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:11,360
actually investigating the forensic audit trail. I want them either getting a GAO audit done,

784
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:17,920
a DOGE audit, this Department of Government Efficiency stuff. I want them to start making

785
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,680
progress on figuring out how the funding is happening and if there's taxpayer dollars or

786
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:28,320
private money that's involved because I think ultimately that's I think the American people

787
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:32,880
deserve to know and the Congress people themselves said it multiple times like we are going to find

788
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:38,080
out about this. That's something I want them desperately to follow up on. I think this is

789
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,880
a good question. Why do you think we haven't seen any new evidence like videos or pics?

790
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,240
Of course, you could reference why a lot of people I think are kind of disappointed there

791
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:52,880
wasn't such evidence shown at the hearings. However, I think the info here is a little bit

792
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,320
more complicated because if we're talking about immaculate constellation, for example, and

793
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,080
some of the imagery there, Kermit talked about this earlier, but it's not like a satellite

794
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:06,480
feeds are giving you a steady 4K recording picture. No, you're giving data. You're just

795
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:13,120
giving streams of data and I think anomalies are noticed in the data for objects in picture or

796
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,680
there's various conditions to kind of identify what the satellite systems for NRO and NGA and

797
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:24,960
stuff are looking at. At this point, this data is filtered and if it's picked up by immaculate

798
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,400
constellation and so forth, it's siloed away quickly. Another thing I'll add as well is like

799
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,200
if you're just looking at ARRO and you're looking at the progress that ARRO has made,

800
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:39,040
by the way, they just released a new report, a historical records report, where they talked

801
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,480
about some of the new cases and morphology and the progress that ARRO has been making.

802
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,560
I like the report. I'm curious to know what the chat's thoughts are this evening about that as

803
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:53,040
well, but what I will say is ARRO has indicated they are building more instrument platforms and so

804
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,840
I think as they're starting to build, I think it was called the Gremlin system, which is like

805
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:03,600
hyper spectral imagery. As these offices and as other organizations start to

806
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:10,080
parse that data and they start to look at that and they can take intelligence from it,

807
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,360
they can scrub it to make sure there's no classified information, I think we're going to

808
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:17,520
start to see that going forward, but I think it's really just been the instruments, the technology

809
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,760
to see this stuff, it's just had to catch up recently. And then somebody asked the question

810
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:28,240
and you relate it, which is a good question. If Sean Kirkpatrick saw no, thought all UAP was

811
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,800
prosaic, why have these Gremlin systems and advanced sensory data have been introduced?

812
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,560
That was a random question from a random person on Twitter, but I thought it was a very, very

813
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:42,880
good question because it's like Kirkpatrick, when he was running ARRO, he had the main line

814
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:49,040
narrative of most, if not all UAP are prosaic, the people that are witnesses are either misinformed

815
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:53,280
or they're providing disinformation to Congress for their own financial benefit, whatever.

816
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,640
But at the same breath, it's like, okay, Kirkpatrick, you're saying UFOs aren't real,

817
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:03,760
but you're spending a bunch of money on cameras that can look at things that aren't visible to the

818
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:08,240
human eye. Why? And speaking of Kirkpatrick, I thought it was mighty funny to see Tim

819
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:14,880
go after Kirkpatrick in both his testimony and congressional submission and Kirkpatrick

820
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,840
kind of fire back like it was a high school drama. He's just mad, I didn't hire him.

821
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,360
Kirkpatrick is so hot under the collar. I'm sure everybody here has seen his

822
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:30,560
interview on Event Horizon. Kirkpatrick is just, he never makes himself look good.

823
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,920
Well, let's not forget his LinkedIn letter after the Grush hearing that posted the same

824
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,160
day after the multi-date Grush. He was so petty with Grush. Yeah.

825
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:44,000
So Area 52 has been going over the 4chan leak from last year. Very interesting stuff. What are

826
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,800
your thoughts on it? My thoughts are I plan to make a full video about it because there's just

827
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:55,280
a lot of interesting tidbits. The 4chan leaker? Yeah, the 4chan leaker, if nobody knows, it's

828
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:01,040
an alleged testimony off of 4chan, which of course is going to raise some red flags because

829
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:06,960
4chan is kind of just a place for a lot of self-deprecating funny people to post about

830
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:12,240
wild stuff. But the theory behind this is that there's basically a hamburger-shaped

831
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:17,760
self-replicating craft that patrols our ocean non-human that custom builds UAP for specific

832
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:23,120
mission purposes. And this is part of the reason that crash is occurring, thus retrievals, because

833
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,000
this specific facility generally doesn't care what happens to its used up product.

834
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:34,560
Well, it's because the UFOs that are coming from this area, whatever this craft is,

835
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:41,520
they seem to be just built for spec, built for that mission. And so it's almost disposable,

836
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,360
right? So sometimes these things aren't perfectly built. They crash and then we pick it up.

837
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,600
My take on it is that that story is very interesting and it sounds like something the

838
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,200
United States maybe would be very interested in doing, but I'll say no more.

839
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So William says, do you think it will be different on the issues of UFOs now that

840
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,880
Trump is president? Absolutely. I personally do. Just because I think part of it he has

841
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,400
spoken about UFOs openly, so I think he'll be more receptive and reporters and media will be more

842
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,680
interested to ask him. And I think with some of the people he's positioned in power might be

843
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:19,120
far more willing to work with him. We'll see how Marco Rubio works with Trump. Trump used to

844
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:25,120
call him Little Marco. Yeah, but I feel like that was a lot of just political

845
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:31,280
swagger. He's just trying to beat Rubio on the election. I don't think he holds that against him.

846
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:42,640
He's just teasing him, I don't know. But I will say Trump has indicated that he's not only interested

847
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:47,920
in getting disclosure about UAPs, but also like the JFK records, 9-11, all these other

848
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:52,960
issues and things that we've been talking about in terms of improper government oversight or

849
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:59,040
possible malfeasance. He wants truth on not just UAPs, just like truth in general. I think that

850
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:05,680
that's a good idea of what we're going to see the next four years. So Shardful, what are your

851
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:10,320
thoughts on Boebert talking about the rumors on the Hill about DoD involved in genetic manipulation?

852
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,600
Interesting. First of all, I thought her line of speaking,

853
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:21,280
like I understand a lot of people right after election want to bring some

854
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:26,160
political jargon into something, but I thought her talking about the last election and so forth

855
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:30,800
was a little bit of a poor taste. It's already difficult to get the subject taken seriously.

856
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:37,120
So you want questions as directed and purposeful as possible, talking about birds being drones.

857
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:42,000
Birds aren't real. Yeah, when you say that, it's just you're making it disingenuous and it

858
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,080
honestly felt like the lines of questioning prior to Boebert taking the stage. It was very

859
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,440
good. It was leading somewhere. There were some very interesting things and then all of a sudden

860
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,160
Boebert gets up and is like birds aren't real and Biden got 81 million votes and it felt for a brief

861
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,160
moment like the air was sucked out and the energy was sucked out for a minute.

862
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,280
Maybe there is some interesting research to be done about genetic manipulation,

863
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,640
but now that she said that, that's associated with conspiracies like birds.

864
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:13,200
Yeah, but it makes you wonder like, okay, Boebert is at least aware of this, but is the other part

865
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:18,560
of the UAP caucus like as Burleson, as Birchhead, as Moskowitz, as Luna, the guys that we know on

866
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:23,200
the Hill that are interested in this, are they also hearing about this too? Because I know Colt's

867
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:28,800
heart, he speculated on his live stream. I don't know the speculation, but kind of saying like,

868
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:34,400
watch this space a little bit because it seems that there are possibly credible allegations

869
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,760
about a hybridization program that have reached Congress and that might be something that will

870
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:45,920
be talked about in further hearings. I think GS15 John Ramirez has talked about that on public

871
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:51,520
forums as well. I can't quite remember, but Truthsau says, who specifically would use a

872
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,960
peanut to testify? One, Ed from Edwards. Two and three, I can't necessarily say. What about you,

873
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:57,520
Kermit?

874
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,600
Probably Deputy Secretary David Turk of the Department of Energy.

875
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,520
Oh, we walked by the DOE today. We did walk by the Forest Hall building.

876
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,200
We took pictures outside the James Forest Hall Department of Energy building to make chat.

877
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:20,320
It was a great time. Yeah, I would subpoena. Definitely, without naming names, some folks

878
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:28,640
in the Air Force that oversee experimental test wings at Edwards and the Deputy Director of,

879
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,920
sorry, the Director of Global Acts, Office of Global Acts. Those are my top three.

880
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:39,120
Or, thank you so much for the 50s. This is for my boys, 10 and 12. Well, thank you. That's

881
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:44,160
extremely nice. Role model and inspiration, thank you very much. I really appreciate the kind words

882
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:49,120
and also extend those same courtesy to Kermit because he is killing it. You're getting a lot

883
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:55,040
of love on this show too, man. Thank you so much. Falcon, Ed, do you think Avi Loeb is an ally or not?

884
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:02,720
Yes, I have a friend who speaks extremely highly of Avi and are trying to maybe facilitate a meeting

885
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:06,240
with himself and me. I'd really like to talk to him. Do you have any thoughts on Avi?

886
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:14,880
I think he's doing a really, really good thing. I think it's so great that the same

887
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:20,800
organization that John Mack was a part of and there was a lot of issues with his internal review.

888
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:27,200
Now, Harvard is kind of supporting Avi Loeb having a more serious inquiry into the major

889
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:35,680
light craft. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I'm just saying, generally, just looking at how

890
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:41,040
Harvard treats their staff is they're a little bit more open to Avi having this discussion

891
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:47,680
versus how they were with Mack decades ago. This is my take. Yeah, I think very highly of Avi.

892
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:52,800
Remember when James Clapper lied about mass surveillance to the Congress and nothing happened?

893
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,640
Yes. It seems like that's talked about quite a lot. They lie about a bunch of stuff.

894
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:06,240
Okay. Sorry, guys. Just looking for some questions. The chat here is always excellent.

895
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,720
That's why I'm trying to look specifically for questions.

896
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:09,680
Yeah, they're awesome.

897
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:17,840
Just because there's a lot of good discussion. Carl Nell and Admiral Wilson. Yeah, that's another.

898
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:22,000
Oh, what do I think of the work Jesse Michaels is doing? I think Jesse is fantastic and he's one

899
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,560
of the best voices in the space. I've got to grow to be friends with him over the last couple of

900
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,240
months and, of course, hang out with him in person. Jesse is wonderful and he is really,

901
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:41,280
really driven to make change in this field. He is a very solid person. Jesse's just got his

902
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,640
own style too, man. We talked about this earlier, but nobody else could show up to the hearings

903
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:50,880
in just like a more laxed fit. If anybody did it, but Jesse, they would look a bit strange.

904
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,680
I think we're towards the end now. Keep submitting those questions. Otherwise,

905
01:17:55,680 --> 01:18:00,480
we'll just keep chatting about the Immaculate Constellation Report, which we'll get into.

906
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:06,000
You'd go with the DOE people too and former CA, Office of Global Access. Yeah, Gaffney would be

907
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,920
good. However, I think the names from Wilson Davis, the senior review group, and specifically would

908
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:16,240
be very good. I would subpoena the sec depths from the 90s. I think Terry was one of them that was

909
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:22,240
talked about who might have had purview because I think he was undersecretary of research and

910
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:27,120
development for DODs, so he would have probably had purview in the early 90s, late 80s.

911
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,880
So we're at a little bit of a good point in the questions now. You want to talk a little bit about

912
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:41,120
the Immaculate Constellation Report? Absolutely. There's one report that you have been mulling

913
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,920
over in your head a lot. Can you tell us about that case? Absolutely. There's the iPad. We got it

914
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:51,520
up right there. So for those of you guys following at home, we're talking about specifically the

915
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:57,040
cases in Section 2, the US government imagery intelligence. Let me pull up a second screen.

916
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:01,920
How about that? Okay. And while we do that, I can have it right here. Okay, we got Max Farr.

917
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,840
Thank you, Max. Max Farr is a good friend of both of us. How's it going, sir? Yeah,

918
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,560
now that we have ARBs mentioned in Immaculate Constellation, the time is nigh. I got to say I

919
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:16,720
am thrilled that the term ARB is fully in the report. I think that's excellent.

920
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:25,680
Yeah, just quickly read it. So something that, you know, just reading all these different reports

921
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:30,080
and the examples of just the imagery intelligence that's included within the database of Immaculate

922
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:35,120
Constellation, I'll say a lot of these reports are very interesting and eye-opening, but there's

923
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:40,960
one that I'm very interested to see if we can get either a FOIA request or like any sort of follow-up

924
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,400
on this because this would seem like a crazy video. Okay, let me just read the description.

925
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:51,040
On U.S. government networks, there exists OPIR footage of a large saucer-shaped UAP emerging

926
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:56,720
from within a dense cloud formation. The saucer registered black-hot against white-cold with

927
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:02,960
atmospheric disturbances caused by the saucer-shaped UAP visible. The saucer was between 200 to 400

928
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:08,000
meters in circumference and displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface, so I think like

929
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:14,640
a dome on top. After breaking above the cloud cover, the saucer-shaped UAP suddenly reverses its

930
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:19,760
direction, descending partially back into the cloud cover, then accelerating rapidly out of frame

931
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:25,200
and partially obscured by the cloud tops. This behavior was evasive in nature and implied that

932
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:30,960
the saucer-shaped UAP had become aware that it was under observation by a space-based collection

933
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:36,160
platform. Now, when I read that, I'm like, it's just like, I'm picturing this and, you know,

934
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:41,440
I'm kind of thinking about the movie NOPE, which was by Jordan Peele. Jordan Peele, and it's a,

935
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,520
you know, horror movie with like an alien vehicle that's like living and it eats people whatever.

936
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:50,000
But the common theme of that movie is like, you know, it's in a cloud. It's this white vehicle

937
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,840
that's like in this cloud. And as I'm like picturing it, I can almost see it as just this

938
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:01,120
giant saucer. It's like coming in and out of the clouds. And it's, you know, as we also talk about,

939
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:07,680
you know, reporting and trying to identify UAP, it seems that these things are either manipulating

940
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:13,040
or, you know, changing their kind of imagery or like how they present themselves so that

941
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:17,600
we're not aware of them or they're just trying to conceal their nature. So like this disc flying

942
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,560
like in the clouds because it doesn't want to be seen by a satellite, like that's kind of crazy.

943
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:28,240
That's kind of crazy. And then further, like what is the, I guess, what is the, what's the video

944
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:31,760
here? Is this like a video from the ground, from a helicopter? Yeah, from ground or a satellite

945
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,480
imagery. I don't know. But I think that that would be a very interesting video to get out in the

946
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:44,160
public. Now, can you tell us about the Indo-Pacific mention where ARV is mentioned, please? Yes,

947
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:50,320
yes, yes. So talking about foreign reproduction vehicles, on U.S. government networks, there

948
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:55,040
exists infrared footage of an imagery of a grouping of vessels engaged in SIGINT,

949
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:59,360
Signals Intelligence, and MASSINT, which is Measurement and Measurement Intelligence.

950
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:04,800
I believe so. Keep reading that. I know we looked this up. SIGINT and MASSINT collection at night

951
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,920
in a specific area of the Pacific Ocean, not naming names. In this footage, which was in

952
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:16,640
close proximity to the vessels, a large equilateral triangle UAP suddenly appears directly over the

953
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:23,120
ships. The three bright points are seen at each bottom corner of the UAP, which is observed to

954
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:28,480
slowly rotate on its horizontal axis. This rotation partially revealed a horizontal bar of

955
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:33,680
sweeping lights. Intelligence analysis associated with this event specifies that the equilateral

956
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:38,640
triangle is a reproduction vehicle and concludes that the vessels must have been made aware of

957
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:43,680
the ARV's frequent use of these coordinates due to foreign pre-positioning of advanced

958
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:48,800
collection assets at the exact time and place. After a brief period of hovering and slowly

959
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:55,440
rotating approximately 500 to 1,000 meters above the ocean, the ARV suddenly disappears and the

960
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:04,160
footage ends. Just ominous. Again, we've heard from individuals, Elizondo whistleblowers,

961
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:10,560
that there are videos and images that exist on U.S. government networks, but a lot of these

962
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:17,920
videos, especially in this case, this was taken in what we would call a denied area. This is a

963
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,320
intelligence surveillance platform that we have in a foreign area that we're using to collect

964
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:29,040
intelligence on our foreign adversaries and others. Releasing that publicly would be a little bit

965
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:36,720
little bit controversial. First, we have the equilateral triangle UAP, but then also potentially

966
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:43,680
we might be doxing another country's legacy program. This would be China in this instance,

967
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:48,880
based on the relative proximity, which this is one of the greatest questions. China and Russia

968
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:56,000
are our adversaries as discussed by some people like David Grush. How much success have they

969
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,960
made in their legacy programs? Grush has said we're in a decades-long Cold War with our adversaries.

970
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:10,240
Did they rip off a TRF 3B triangle? It's really, really interesting. I find it interesting that

971
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:16,080
the term ARB slash RV is used too. It's not just Alien Reproduction Vehicle, but also

972
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,560
Reproduction Vehicle. I'm happy that distinction was made because Reproduction Vehicle could just

973
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:27,120
mean a reverse engineer to make jet or something. Forgive me for speculating here on the live stream,

974
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:32,720
but what if Alien Reproduction Vehicle and Reproduction Vehicle kind of leaves out the

975
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:38,000
possibility that we have Reproduction Vehicles that we wouldn't necessarily call Alien. In the

976
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,600
sense of there's potentially objects that are coming extraterrestrially, which we would consider

977
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:50,080
general or traditional aliens. Or is there stuff that's coming interdimensional or within our oceans

978
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:56,320
or some coming in and out of our existence? We could call that Alien or we could call it something

979
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:00,400
else. But at the end of the day, what we're trying to copy, it's a reproduction vehicle.

980
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:09,280
I thought this instance was interesting as well due to just one sentence. So,

981
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:16,160
Southcom tic-tac detected by space asset in proximity a vessel. On USG networks, there exists

982
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:22,240
OPIR imagery of massent of a tic-tac UAP transmitting through an area of the Atlantic Ocean.

983
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:27,760
The tic-tac maneuvers had an altitude at or near local cloud coverage and correlated electromagnetic

984
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:32,640
signatures were collected by massent. In the available footage, the tic-tac UAP transits

985
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:38,880
rapidly through the field of regard as it transits the ocean. No observation reaction is seen to come

986
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:44,240
from the vessel, but its proximity in space and in time and space to the trajectory of this UAP

987
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:50,320
suggests foreknowledge of the UAP event by intelligence. So, what's interesting to me

988
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:55,840
that there is so Magnetic Constellation is just kind of accessing these intelligence databases to

989
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:01,520
collect records and so forth. So, who is the intelligence organization behind shooting this

990
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:07,040
video if they had forewarned knowledge of this UAP incursion event and thus were kind of predicting

991
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:12,240
its movements? Would this be a satellite system? I don't think it's too far of a stretch to think

992
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:17,520
some of these sightings may be conducted by NRO and NGA, gruscious positions who have

993
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,520
satellite systems that actually can detect and track some of these vehicles. Yeah, and just knowing

994
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,960
how just, I mean, I've never worked in government or military intelligence, but just briefly how

995
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,680
that kind of works is, I think that they're trying to get multiple signatures of the same

996
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:37,600
object. It's one thing just to get a satellite, but then also like ground sensor, camera, underwater

997
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:44,640
sensor, a second kind of corroborative source to verify if this thing is existing, it's real.

998
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:48,960
They're tracking it usually on more than one kind of instrument. And let's talk a little bit about

999
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:56,000
the morphologies, right? So, we're using a data set from 1991 to 2002. I'd just like to talk about

1000
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,640
the morphologies just because it's so interesting. Within the irregular shapes, of course, the jelly

1001
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:07,840
fish are floating brains with appendages. Where we see that one is mentioned. Yeah, exactly. And

1002
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:13,840
there's also another mention in the report about, I think it's the Mexican border of a jellyfish,

1003
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:19,120
which I'll talk about too, but sphere or orb. So, of course, Aero had reported on this as well,

1004
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:23,840
including some old data and blue book and so forth. Spheres were the most reported shape with

1005
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:29,600
variations ranging from smooth, featureless orbs to spheres with visible openings or appendages.

1006
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:35,600
These objects prevalence suggests a possible standard in UAP design or function capable of

1007
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:40,640
high maneuverability and speed. The diversity within the sphere category spanning from simple

1008
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:46,240
polished appearances to more complex structures with appendages suggests a broad range of purposes

1009
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:51,440
or technologies unique to the platform's mission and or the originator. The mention of appendages

1010
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:57,280
on spheres instead of a ubiquitous smooth shape reminds me of the 2010 San Diego Sphere Siding.

1011
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:02,320
Have you heard of that? I don't think so now. It's a long video. It's about a 12 minute video of a

1012
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:09,280
sphere that has what you would describe as almost an antenna around the circumference. And so that

1013
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:15,440
is one really interesting sighting. Disk or saucer. Saucer shaped UAPs reported with and

1014
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:20,160
without domes. If you want to look that up, go to the It's Redacted YouTube channel. This was posted

1015
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:24,720
a couple years ago and maybe we can hold an image up to the screen. They have the full video. Saucer

1016
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:30,240
shaped UAPs reported with and without domes were the second most common shape reported. Flat saucers

1017
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:36,160
were reported as well. These being disks like objects without pronounced domes. Trilateral

1018
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:42,800
biconvex UAPs are also reported in the data. So I think in the Aero Historical Reporting Trends in

1019
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:48,400
2022, the saucer shapes were not featured as one of the most common sightings. So I could be wrong

1020
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:52,160
there, but that is a, did you see it? No, I was just making a quick note for myself. Okay, let me

1021
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:56,400
pull it. I can pull it up. I'll pull it up. You, why don't you read us about oval and tic-tac and

1022
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,880
bring up some interesting stuff there, especially because I didn't Kirk Patrick imply that the

1023
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:06,240
tic-tac may have been human technology? Did Kirk Patrick say that? I don't know, maybe.

1024
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:14,080
Oval or tic-tac oval shaped UAPs were infrequently reported within the data set and only after

1025
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:20,400
approximately 2003, these UAPs either maintained a uniform egg-like symmetry occasionally tampered

1026
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:26,160
into a teardrop shape. So cylinders with convex ends, tic-tacs fall into this category and

1027
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:31,680
occasionally feature visible, visible protuberances on the top or bottom of the otherwise uniform

1028
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:37,360
plan. So that'd be like the flavor incident, right? With the almost kind of features on the

1029
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:44,080
bottom of the craft. So let me pull this up because this is a really, I think, oh, oh, yeah, yeah,

1030
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:48,080
yeah, I've seen that photo. So this is what I think of when I hear spear and some of the appendages.

1031
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:52,640
You guys may have, sorry, you may have heard of the sighting that's 2000. I can't remember the

1032
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:59,520
year San Diego Sphere. The YouTube channel is long been defunct, but it's fantastic. It's redacted,

1033
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:05,280
has a video on the entire, entire sighting. Will you read off the triangle description?

1034
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,720
Oh, absolutely. Interesting point I want to touch on there.

1035
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:13,680
So triangles were among the rarest UAPs reported in the data. Most of these sightings were

1036
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:19,840
equilateral triangles occasionally with vertical stabilizers visible on the top of the UAP.

1037
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:25,520
Along gated isosceles types were also reported, were also reported occasionally with the same

1038
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:31,440
vertical stabilizers observed on the equilateral type. So the vertical stabilizers is an interesting

1039
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:36,720
point. Conventional triangle designs such as the, you know, what you would call the TR3B does not

1040
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:42,000
feature this. If you look at some other simple, some other similar designs like the alleged TR3A

1041
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,200
Astra or so forth, or even that video Tom DeLonge likes to champion, it's that green

1042
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,560
UFO video at night. One thing I noticed about that triangle is it has stabilizers on top. So

1043
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,560
I've always tried to reference that because that sort of looks similar to like the X43 unmanned

1044
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:02,000
NASA craft and so forth. So that's a, that's a pretty darn interesting. Yeah. All right.

1045
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,920
What are you looking at now in the report? Sorry, we're kind of bouncing back and forth

1046
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,200
between the report, but you know, I thought it, I thought it was important for all of us to talk

1047
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:12,640
about it and anything that stood out to you guys just leave in the comments. Any questions,

1048
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:18,080
especially just let us know about the question. Yeah, I will say just like looking at these

1049
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:23,200
different types and just kind of thinking about, you know, the different reports that's kind of

1050
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:28,160
being summarized in here, right? Like spheres are, you know, the most common, but they're also kind

1051
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:33,360
of the smallest. And then triangles are the rarest, but they can be anywhere from an F16 to a

1052
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:38,400
size of a football field. Doesn't it say 600 feet as well? Or no, 600 feet is from other

1053
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:44,640
avenues of research. Never mind. Believes. Yeah. Like football field size. Yeah. Football field

1054
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:51,680
and 300 feet. So up to two football feats in length. I think the distinction between equilateral

1055
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:58,320
and isosceles triangle is important as well. As far as all research I've done into human made

1056
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:04,480
triangles, most of them seem equilaterally shaped. There's only a handful of cases dating back to

1057
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:12,240
the late 80s, early 90s and early 2000s of isosceles kind of shape triangles. Well, we also have

1058
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:16,800
not just triangles, but we also have boomerang arrowhead. Think of the Phoenix lights or think

1059
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,920
of the testimony of the man who testified at Stephen Greer's NPC, Stephen Digna, who talked

1060
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:27,360
about being at a bombing range. And before he left the service due to his health and

1061
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:33,200
Raytheon contractors basically facilitating a bomb, a boomerang shaped craft that was projecting

1062
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,320
something that came onto the range. That's an interesting testimony I'd like to revisit.

1063
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:43,360
Yeah. And then also just a lot of the atmospheric or kind of unique emissions and

1064
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:49,120
behavior seen by a lot of these as we see loss of time, visual disturbances, feelings of unease

1065
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:56,480
or anxiety, electronic device malfunction. And I think Kevin Knuth at Seoul last year gave the

1066
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:02,480
best examples of electromagnetic distortion and magnetic distortion. I highly recommend checking

1067
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:09,360
that out. I did watch that. That was really good. Very good. What about the organic shapes?

1068
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:14,720
Because I think that is probably one of the most interesting things for many people. Yep.

1069
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:19,360
Irregularly shaped UAPs, those that devise simple geometric description were among the

1070
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:24,160
rarest reported sightings. Shapeshifting UAPs also appear in the dataset, typically having

1071
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:29,760
a spherical or disc-like base form from which irregular geometries are seen to project.

1072
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:34,720
Floating brain or jellyfish UAPs are present as well, characterized by a central mass from

1073
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:40,480
which multiple arms or spars hang downward. Finally, combined shapes were also observed,

1074
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:47,040
including cubes within spheres, ringed saucers, and various rectangular and cuboid forms.

1075
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,880
The cuboid form, of course, that's interesting, calling back to Ryan Graves.

1076
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,000
Cube within a sphere is also one of those sightings as well.

1077
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,600
Specific mention of brain is very interesting to me specifically. The two don't really correlate,

1078
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:04,560
but I often think back to the physics concept of Boltzmann brain. The idea behind a Boltzmann

1079
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,720
brain from physicists can't remember his name Boltzmann, but it'd be far more efficient rather

1080
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:15,040
than an existing universe with matter for just a basically a combination of electric

1081
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:19,680
charged particles forming a brain, drifting through space, thinking of the material universe.

1082
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:25,440
I just think of that for the brain shape. Yeah, and something else just to point out

1083
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:30,480
that might be interesting is in terms of unique emissions, what we see with these irregular

1084
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:34,800
organics is that we see a temperature drop associated with these, and we don't really see

1085
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:40,400
that reported with the other morphologies, which is interesting. I'd be interested if there's

1086
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:45,920
any transmedial sighting or footage of these organic shapes, if there's also a temperature drop

1087
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:53,280
and temperature gradient as it may enter C or other domain, for variable temperatures.

1088
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:56,480
That'd be kind of interesting to see the heat signature and how it alters over the course

1089
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:02,000
of its flight. If perhaps when it moves faster, it heats up and so forth. Of course, we're not

1090
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:08,640
privy to any of this information, but we got our public report on our hands. Well, I think someone

1091
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:14,160
in the chat mentioned earlier, Oak Shannon. I think this is a very, very interesting kind of

1092
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:19,520
little tidbit in this document here. For section five, restricted US government historical records,

1093
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:24,400
there is a call out to a specific, it's a serial number that corresponds to an official NSA report

1094
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:31,760
published in 1978, which people have now confirmed was included, this specific citation was included

1095
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,840
in Oak Shannon's notes, which is very interesting. The specific notes, I'm trying to remember the

1096
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:41,280
actual event I've referenced it a few times. The specific event, it may have been at Los Alamos

1097
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:46,400
National Labs where Oak Shannon took notes from some detailed speakers. I referenced here when

1098
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:53,440
Oak Shannon relayed information he was told about an undersea base, a USO base. So he writes about

1099
01:35:53,440 --> 01:36:00,000
that. He writes about connection to possible MHD propulsion physics with, I think, a 3.5 gigahertz

1100
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,360
range. Numerous interesting notes about programs. I think he mentions Bobby Ray Inman in that.

1101
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:10,320
That's just off the top of my head, but these notes are for a panel of speakers that I think was at

1102
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:15,040
Los Alamos in the late 80s. Yep. And then just to add about this report as well. The substance of

1103
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:19,840
the report concerns scientific research in the Soviet Union on the topics of parapsychology,

1104
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:25,040
Psi, and biological effects on UAPs on human beings. Additionally, the existence of this

1105
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:29,760
reporting stream demonstrates that US intelligence was explicitly tasked to collect on foreign entities

1106
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:35,200
active in areas often relegated to the fringes of scientific research, including parapsychology,

1107
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:39,440
and the biological effects of encounters with UAP. And this shouldn't be surprising, guys,

1108
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:43,600
even people who are uncomfortable with the idea of Psi like myself, it's pretty new to them.

1109
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:50,320
Let's think back to the NSWC crane project in which not only SAIC, but the Project Stargate,

1110
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:55,520
which was researching the Psi phenomena from SRI and the CIA. But even in 2011 and onward,

1111
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:01,440
the O&R, the Office of Naval Research, published papers on human sixth sense and human psionic

1112
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:07,440
abilities, which is still extremely strange. This is why we need good smart guys like Max,

1113
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:13,040
who are really well researched into some of this this Psi connection. Absolutely.

1114
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,960
So let's go. I think we got some questions. We'll look through the chat with it. We'll look through

1115
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:22,160
here. So have you or anyone you know made any inroads to getting information around the energy

1116
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:28,800
source of these vehicles? Has anyone talked about plasma? Yes. I think Edgar Fouchet in the TR3B

1117
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:35,040
discusses superheated plasma along with mercury. Inroads, as far as the energy source, there's

1118
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:38,960
disagreements. I know really smart people who think that we haven't quite cracked zero point

1119
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:44,400
systems. I think to the story of Brad Sorensen, where zero point systems are applicable. I've

1120
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:51,040
heard from numerous people that electrogravity are a thing. Could you mind passing me a soda?

1121
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:56,160
Yeah, I got you. I think electrogravity are possibly a thing too. Of course, there's the story

1122
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:07,120
of MFD, MHD. So there's quite a bit of information around energy systems. Nothing concrete yet.

1123
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,880
I don't know if you have heard anything else. Sorry, I was just kind of going off topic there.

1124
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:18,000
Do you guys believe Grush will ever be allowed on a skiff? They've now had nearly 18 months to

1125
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,840
hide everything. That is a good point, right? If locations are violated, then there's not

1126
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:30,240
immediate actionable intelligence follow-ups that these locations will likely be cleared or

1127
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:37,520
further obfuscations created. If I remember, Grush did not get in a skiff with Verchette?

1128
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:44,160
I don't think he got in a skiff with them at all. Okay, yeah. I know that Burleson has at least

1129
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:52,800
been privy to the op-ed by Grush. I have these conversations occurred outside of Skiff, I'm

1130
01:38:52,800 --> 01:39:02,160
not sure, but to me, it's pretty unacceptable. Okay, yeah. We talked about this a little bit,

1131
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:06,640
but do you think Boebert's comments were purposeful in order to harm public perception on this topic?

1132
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:12,560
Judi, by the way, she talked. I just think she probably carries a bit of the stigma, because

1133
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:16,080
I'd like to mention, guys, before the hearings even started, the cameraman,

1134
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,080
when people were filing in and looked at me and said, oh, this is going to go on Ancient Aliens,

1135
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:25,760
right? What am I going to say to that? No, this is a serious congressional hearing. Right outside,

1136
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:29,520
I had to run out, use the restroom before we started. I hear a bunch of staffers or congressmen

1137
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:34,160
talking, this is what happens when you leave YouTube autoplay on for too long. If you're finding

1138
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:38,240
my channel off autoplay, first of all, thanks for being here. But second of all, I mean, that's

1139
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:44,960
so foolish. And that's the sort of mind and stigma that has been manufactured. And it's

1140
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:48,800
understandable if you have felt that and experienced that, because that is very well

1141
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:54,560
orchestrated by the CIA all the way back since 52. But many people fall victim to this.

1142
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:58,720
Yeah. I mean, it's one thing just to make jokes and just being coy about it and just being like,

1143
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:03,520
oh, yeah, Ancient Aliens, whatever. It's funny to joke about. But I did notice that there were

1144
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:11,360
quite a few people that they talk about it as if this is... There isn't really anything there

1145
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:16,640
there. And it's still kind of a conspiracy. And who are these people and what are these programs?

1146
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:23,760
She treats it the same as maybe like chemtrails or other popular conspiracies like birds.

1147
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:28,720
But also from her perspective, she's kind of been like one of the conspiracy theorists in

1148
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:35,040
Congress. That's kind of her reputation, if you will. So, hey, I mean, roll with what you know.

1149
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:40,160
But I don't think her comments were super helpful or really appreciated by people

1150
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:44,000
in the UFO world that wanted sober conversation about this.

1151
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,720
And I think a lot of the people that are going to affect change when we have

1152
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:51,680
Congress people like this are going to be their staffers. There's a world of staffers that take

1153
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:56,400
this very seriously who want to learn. And they want to affect change and they want to have the

1154
01:40:56,400 --> 01:41:02,400
information to brief. Not brief, that might be a poor word, but to inform the person they work

1155
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:07,040
for and so forth. So, Magic says, have you seen Sheehan making the rounds lately? What are your

1156
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:10,480
thoughts on everything he is saying? Seems worlds apart from just getting into the public site,

1157
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:16,400
guys. Well, we had lunch yesterday right by Sheehan in this crazy, crazy gray hair. And

1158
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:20,000
he also had like a disclosure event outside of the park right after.

1159
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,800
There was a rally outside like a block away from the Rayburn building where the hearing happened.

1160
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:30,640
And he spoke and then a couple other individuals spoke as well. Yeah.

1161
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:37,440
I think for the amount of information Sheehan puts out, he needs to start supplying adequate

1162
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:44,080
research, go along it, alongside of it or evidence or other people to confirm these statements.

1163
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,720
Danny Sheehan, of course, has been very consequential as a really interesting person,

1164
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:54,160
but before he continues to put forward new information, he kind of needs to figure out

1165
01:41:54,160 --> 01:42:02,560
ways to back up his things he said previously. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what I will say about that

1166
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,440
with Sheehan is I think he's not a stranger to kind of fighting the government as well.

1167
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:13,680
And I think part of it is he has kind of a role to play as kind of the legal person that's helping

1168
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:18,640
facilitate stuff behind the scenes with certain players. But also as we see kind of with this

1169
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:25,040
new Paradigm Institute, I think, you know, there's kind of a public perception or kind of awareness

1170
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:29,120
intention there of just trying to get that organization set up. So I think that's kind

1171
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:33,520
of why we're seeing this like interesting stuff with Sheehan, because traditionally, you know,

1172
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:37,600
he's like, he's a lawyer, he's an attorney, he's kind of working on the investigative space,

1173
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,720
but then also seeing him with like the new Paradigm Institute and that stuff as well,

1174
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:45,600
it's like, okay, how do you reconcile that? Selling degrees. Yeah. Yeah. For tens of thousands of

1175
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:50,400
dollars. Jimmy says, I have friends who believe it's almost definitely Chinese or Russian tech,

1176
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:54,880
especially Chinese. What, if any, gives you the confirmation this is fact alien slash

1177
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:59,920
NHI? Well, I think quite a few factors. One of them is the persistent existence of this phenomenon

1178
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:05,680
for more than 80 years. In fact, you can even go into other stories in history, but even dating

1179
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:09,760
back to the Magenta Crash in 1933, there are similarities in this phenomenon in terms of

1180
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:14,480
crash shape, in terms of performance characteristics of craft. I mean, you had Nazi scientists,

1181
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:19,200
Herman Oberth, studying flying saucer flight dynamics, estimating tens if not hundreds of

1182
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:23,200
thousands miles per hour, these things would be flown. You can also look at the G-forces

1183
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:28,160
experienced by some of these craft. It's not a ballistic missile that can handle 120 Gs. It's

1184
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:34,160
not a human being that can sustain nine Gs before seeing permanent injury. I know Lou talked about

1185
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:39,760
this during the hearing or was it UAPBF? We talked about G-forces experienced by the craft. Was that

1186
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:43,200
the hearing? That was at the hearing. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So Lou kind of lobald that a little bit.

1187
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:47,440
If you look at the work by Kevin Knuth and estimating flight characteristics of unidentified

1188
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:51,840
aerial phenomenon, which is a great paper, I highly recommend everybody read this.

1189
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:57,120
It analyzes the performance characteristics of not just the 2004 Nimitz, but also the 1986

1190
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:02,240
Japan Airlines case and other such cases. G-forces of this, these craft can be experienced

1191
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:10,960
of up to 5,000 Gs. That's very different. There's also numerous reports from under fast walkers that

1192
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:16,960
NORAD and NASA and the DSP defense support program would call these craft back in the 60s, 70s,

1193
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:21,280
and 80s that had a term for craft that were entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere.

1194
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:28,640
These would not show classical characteristics of fuel burning rockets and traditional

1195
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:33,440
prosaic technologies. These things would sometimes arrive from deep space or return to deep space.

1196
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:38,480
I don't know, especially in the 60s and 70s of Chinese tech, that's playing into do that.

1197
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:43,520
Yeah. Again, we're also talking about sightings that have been seen even before

1198
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:48,960
modern weapons as well. How far do we really want to go with this?

1199
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:57,040
I would say there is a lot of evidence to suggest that there was a phenomenon that existed well

1200
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:04,560
before the Second World War and the creation of the world superpowers, all that stuff. You can try

1201
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,520
to figure out whether or not that's alien non-human. I personally think that that seems to be the

1202
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:13,680
conclusion just based off of those historical reports. I know there's a lot of researchers

1203
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:19,040
that look at that pre-modern history of UFO sightings. Which is very valid.

1204
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:27,840
I think your friend is right about the idea that some of these craft might be ARB of Chinese or

1205
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:35,440
Russian origin. Just like many of the ARB are of United States origin. Some of our allies possibly

1206
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:40,640
also have their own technology as well. I just think that many of the craft, especially when

1207
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:45,120
you start looking at craft characteristics and differences in reported craft that are considered

1208
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:51,200
ARB versus non-human craft, just the difference in the craft makeup. Non-human craft often described

1209
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:56,720
as perfect, rivetless, seamless, no visible means of propulsion, somehow able to create,

1210
01:45:56,720 --> 01:46:00,480
go faster than the speed of sound and decelerate quickly without any sonic booms,

1211
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:05,600
without with very minimal or no electromagnetic signatures or signatures of any kind.

1212
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:12,240
The performance characteristics of these craft are not prosaic even to when people say oh well

1213
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:16,960
you know military is 20 years ahead, there's you know ballistic missiles 20 years from now

1214
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:21,120
are not surviving 5,000 geese of force dropping from 15,000 feet to sea level in less than two

1215
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:29,440
seconds. Okay got anything about my question on getting remote viewing under mainstream

1216
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:34,640
science scrutiny? Are there any efforts there from me? Yes, yes, yes, I see. Yes, and talking to

1217
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:40,560
Chris from Area 52, I would really like to maybe see if we can put on some public displays

1218
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:45,840
of remote viewing to maybe you know introduce the the channel to whether the efficacy or

1219
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:52,320
or not not if there's nothing there. I would absolutely like to do that because this would

1220
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:56,720
be something we'd all be learning together. Well they had a lot of those studies in the late 80s

1221
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:01,520
and 90s and at least according to the government there was no there wasn't really a basis to

1222
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:07,200
continue funding of it but then ultimately that whole program got transferred over to SAIC in 1995.

1223
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:12,320
So do you believe the blue book classified version of his story where he says he saw the images this

1224
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:18,800
is um this is Danny Sheehan. Yes after yeah I would say after like I think there's been some

1225
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:23,600
records that have come out of the era like out of this like whole declassification process and

1226
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:29,120
particularly the Air Force Blue Book documents. The symbols that he that Sheehan has like drawn out

1227
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:34,400
or whatever um like. This was put in NARA recently right the National Archives. Yep yep so like he

1228
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:38,560
like the depiction I think the depiction that he gave of those symbols is like dead accurate

1229
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,800
of the symbols that are in these blue book files. Yeah I'd also like to reference it is a fact that

1230
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:48,640
there were programs working alongside blue book that were not unacknowledged but not referenced

1231
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:52,880
this would be project Stork out of Patel and then you can also adhere to the testimony of other

1232
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:58,560
whistleblowers such as Steven Lufkin who said that he was privy to a program more classified

1233
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:02,720
than blue book a more classified blue book basically where he was shown some of the Roswell

1234
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:09,520
degree and so yes I think that is a really good really good question. Question how do you guys

1235
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:13,200
picture disclosure personally I think Richette's whistleblower type protections won't pass but

1236
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:19,360
if it does I think there has to be someone walking out of Lockheed etc. If there are pension protections

1237
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:25,520
I think that could be possible that's what I have to say. Yep I think that specific language of it

1238
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:30,560
is they're going to give whistleblower protections to any whistleblower that has knowledge of

1239
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:35,600
basically taxpayer funds that are being used so I think the first inquiry right is like government

1240
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,600
funds taxpayer money that's being spent on this and I think that that's good I hope that those

1241
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:45,120
protections pass um but then I think the second part right and this is it goes back to kind of

1242
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:49,280
the theory of like how does this get funded well if the government's not writing a black check to

1243
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:53,600
Lockheed Martin are they taking money from investors potentially and then like how aware of those

1244
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,600
investors in those types of programs and that's a question that's really kind of the messier

1245
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:01,120
legal questions that open up from that questions like that you have been talking about and thinking

1246
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:05,200
about quite a bit the last couple of days I've talked with a lot of people about it it's very

1247
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:11,520
interesting okay Eric says uh any comments on how put off you brought Lew into the program and many

1248
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:15,840
others he met with H teller and worked on graph control best candidate for involvement in legacy

1249
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:21,600
program I am oh I am really eagerly awaiting his appearance in the program he needs to get subpoena

1250
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:26,560
yeah he needs to get subpoena too but I think he'd be uh I think he'd be a agreeable witness

1251
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:30,880
because there's hostile witnesses there's non agreeable witnesses and there's agreeable witnesses

1252
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:37,760
he should be encouraged to attend the hearing and a closed yeah senate section okay lou said this

1253
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:45,280
okay you're talking about lou in the cold war same as grush um do you believe that UAP are alive

1254
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:48,960
as Luna said a theory I've seen in the genre for a while well as we talked about in the

1255
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:55,200
immaculate constellation report the idea of biological crap would then um would then kind

1256
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:59,360
of encourage that I think it's quite possible you know we talk about this all the time I don't

1257
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:04,960
think UAP and non-human intelligence is mutually exclusive or is is really siloed if there's one

1258
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:09,120
non-human intelligence here it opens the door for numerous types of non-human intelligence

1259
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:14,880
all with different capabilities and um basically propulsion systems and methods of travel and

1260
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:21,200
methods of communication and methods of detailing their presence are all quite possible yeah I will

1261
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:27,440
say the movie nope Jordan Peele great movie scary but I can definitely see that happening

1262
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:35,120
after the specific mention of brain in the uh IC report it's it's very very very startling to me

1263
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:41,520
okay oh okay this is a good one for us max can you speculate on the origin of the sphere that

1264
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:48,320
was located underneath NSWC for anybody that doesn't know um the program Kermit and I worked on

1265
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:54,960
together was um the off-world technologies division yep experienced by Green Beret 18 Bravo weapon

1266
01:50:54,960 --> 01:51:02,000
sergeant RA uh witness RA who in the early 2010s was sent to RA for an advanced weapons trading

1267
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,680
course and here he and one other person because of their high clearance levels and because of

1268
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:12,720
some of their accomplishments level five of sphere um you know deployments and so forth were

1269
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:17,840
basically taken underground by a contractor seen some interesting Russian ballistics and

1270
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:22,000
some interesting weaponry as an 18 Bravo weapon sergeant you have to do proficient with all

1271
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:28,880
forms of small arms fire and then they're brought into a place deep underground um the air was

1272
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:36,640
described as very damp stale cold by RA into an off-world technologies division here the contractor

1273
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:43,920
who we both highly suspect as SAIC show two pieces of technology one and almost tablet device that

1274
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:48,960
seemed to be projecting writing uh RA did not know if this was in his head or actually physically

1275
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:55,040
like a holographic projection of writing and this piece was said to have been recovered uh during

1276
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:01,840
being recovered and was considered a weapon due to an electric or an energetic discharge during

1277
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:07,120
recovery the other piece was a sphere about the size of a baseball with a small indent at the top

1278
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:13,200
this was described as metallic but very smooth and almost shimmering like oil on water

1279
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:20,560
RA was told that this specific piece of technology somehow interacted with consciousness as far as

1280
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:26,960
the origins of this I've talked to max the person asking the question and Kermit here about another

1281
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:32,240
individual Navy connect Navy connected who likely interacted with the same technology a couple

1282
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:42,080
decades prior so if that's the case the Navy might have had an active program uh with this piece for

1283
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:48,960
weird kind of the size stuff we were talking about the origins if it's housed alongside that gauntlet

1284
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:53,600
tablet type thing that is considered weapons technology one has to assume that this was also

1285
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:58,480
a piece of technology recovered from a crash retrieval absolutely and I also think just the

1286
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:02,240
nature of the crash retrievals themselves and we kind of see this in other reports here and there is

1287
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:08,320
as these things are taken in right as we're retrieving these craft were then trying to

1288
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:12,640
you know piece off these different areas of like okay Lockheed figure out how the craft work SAIC

1289
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:16,400
figure out how this orb works right north figure out how this engine works right and just trying

1290
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:21,440
to piece these different areas and giving these technologies transferred over to private industry

1291
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:28,960
to try to see if they can figure out how this shit works you know I at least don't know the origin

1292
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:36,240
but I can with confidence say that this was taken off of a crash retrieval where when are there

1293
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:41,840
multiple no idea absolutely no idea the witness I've spoken to that encountered this was on the

1294
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:48,800
other side of the country the California to be exact so was this program shelved that the

1295
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:53,600
Navy used with this and then this is just housed for further analysis and I would like to harken

1296
01:53:53,600 --> 01:54:00,320
back to Harold Malmgren who spoke about being briefed in the 1960s about an other world technologies

1297
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:06,080
division yep very close yep do you guys feel like any of these quote-unquote UFOs can be top secret

1298
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:11,920
government weapons absolutely alien reproduction vehicle absolutely absolutely it's just I mean

1299
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:17,280
UFO is an unidentified flying object you see like an experimental aircraft you don't know what the

1300
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:21,360
hell it is you're going to think it's a UFO right but it could just be something like a you know new

1301
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:26,240
drone or you know the new self-claim whatever so yeah what do you say we'll go for 10 more minutes

1302
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:30,560
answering questions yeah all right guys we'll keep going for some questions for a few more minutes and

1303
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:35,760
then we'll uh okay we answered that about how put off Eric sorry if we're getting to the question

1304
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:41,200
slow guys I just think you know I'm glad Kermit feels the same way everyone's taking their time

1305
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:45,920
to ask questions so really appreciate it y'all yeah and these are I told you Kermit everybody

1306
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:52,560
ask the best questions here okay with the admission that yes USG has a crash retrieval in reverse

1307
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:57,120
engineering program for UAP this validates claims of Herrera and Weigand is there a lawsuit in the

1308
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:06,000
works reparations I think their cases are you know far more kind of uh I guess Michael's case

1309
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,640
doesn't relegate to that as much because remember Michael's case talks about seeing an alien

1310
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:16,560
reproduction vehicle this specifically octagonal shaped I'm still trying to track down the manufacturer

1311
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:22,960
for that Greer thinks it's locky but has proposed no evidence but Weigand his story is one of those

1312
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:28,160
more classic crash retrievals and with some of the comments in the IC report about you know

1313
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:33,600
psychological effects and then the probability that was a DOE nest team you know you kind of have

1314
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:37,520
to analyze that with a more credible with a different lens and you do with Michael now with

1315
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:44,960
the testimony of ARV I just am waiting to see a dang report of a octagonal ARV please yeah okay let me

1316
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,040
okay okay talking about the oak shane and serial numbers

1317
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:55,360
what do you think it will take for mainstream scientific analysis to start looking into remote

1318
01:55:55,360 --> 01:56:01,680
viewing and either confirm or debunk it for good that's a good question I and I have to assume

1319
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:08,560
academia approaching UAP and how they approach UAP is likely the same approach they take to

1320
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:12,880
promote viewing I cannot think of a reason why the subject should not be studied seriously

1321
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:18,320
especially when the Navy studies yeah this might seem like a very random call out but I'm I'm now

1322
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:23,840
remembering there's a 60 minutes documentary that happened that looked at basically there's a scientific

1323
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:28,800
study that was done where they were trying to prove precognition where individuals were like

1324
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,640
shown as a set of numbers or something and they basically had to predict what the next number

1325
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:37,920
and the sequence was going to be like before they even saw it and what they determined from that

1326
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:44,160
is that it seemed that there was some type of correlation between you know we what we call

1327
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:49,360
a sixth sense or something that's like you know exists in our mind but there was there was a very

1328
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:54,720
real trend where like these individuals could like use this precognitive ability so I feel like

1329
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:59,680
stuff like that and just kind of getting those types of reports and just getting the awareness out

1330
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:05,360
and then you know trying to come up with ways kind of similar to that study I know it's kind of like

1331
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:10,240
weirdly specific and it's just off the dome but I think things like that will kind of help us try to

1332
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:14,800
figure that out it's strange to me that kind of the fallback is oh the CIA did a study in the 80s

1333
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:20,640
and their Stargate and nothing came from it yeah it's not a reason not to study the subject no

1334
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:25,280
okay thoughts on the skinny bob video I think I get to ask this every time I have I have no

1335
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:32,080
thoughts about it I I have never once studied it at least from a first glance it looks to be a

1336
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:37,440
little a little too smooth for for realness what do you say Kermit but I have not studied it at all

1337
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:46,720
yeah I I don't I don't um I don't have an opinion on any videos that claim to depict biologics

1338
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:53,440
or non-human intelligence so question and of course like you know if the politics are pertinent

1339
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:57,200
to UAP of course we'll talk about it not to be political but don't you worry that people like

1340
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:01,360
bobert and trump might lessen the credibility of the top rick half the country doesn't take him

1341
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:06,400
seriously that that is something I think we talked about that if trump really pushed disclosure

1342
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:11,120
would that kind of be used as a talking point to discredit disclosure because so many people find

1343
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:16,640
trump in the kind of poor taste it raises a good question uh bobert as well as we kind of saw with

1344
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:23,760
the the hearing um wrong attitude in my opinion yeah I will say I had an interesting conversation

1345
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:28,240
with some staffers on the democrat side they kind of brought up the same point too of just like hey

1346
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:33,200
you know particularly in the hearing yesterday a lot of the representatives in that were republican

1347
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:37,040
and I think as we think about the next four years and trumping president and all those new

1348
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:43,600
cabinet positions and whatnot um you know I think we'll we'll start to see some more answers but

1349
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:48,640
again I think to your point right when bobert and trump talk about this I think people particularly

1350
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:52,240
on the other side kind of see it a certain way and they'll just kind of check out and be like oh

1351
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:57,360
trump's a crazy person and this just confirms my own opinion um I do think he could be a good asset

1352
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:01,600
it's just it's really coming down to the communication it's tough to navigate now just with so much

1353
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:07,360
distrust in any administration really yeah yeah so you know we'll see it it's a great question and

1354
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:12,800
if it's yeah go ahead we should talk about trump's uncle because uh that's something that I love to

1355
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:17,600
bring up when people get political about this so donald trump's uncle was john trump who was a

1356
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:24,160
mit professor who was he worked for the radiation laboratory at lincoln lab and he was like one of

1357
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:30,000
the early founders of radar and in 1943 when tesla died john trump was called in by the united states

1358
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:33,920
to basically document all of tesla's patents and make sure that none of them were dangerous so

1359
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:38,400
I don't want to get too speculative I don't want to say that john trump was part of legacy program

1360
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:42,000
but of all the people with all the relevant experience I think his uncle would have been

1361
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:48,640
someone that would have known something that's a great point so so what is uh kms what is your

1362
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:52,720
opinion on gold's testimony if you consider begging for money a testimony I think it's disappointing

1363
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:58,880
he was not asked about material transfer between all sap uh bigelow aerospace and lock emart yeah I

1364
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:05,280
agree I it honestly it's like that was that's what I was expecting and ultimately it's like maybe

1365
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:10,000
you know maybe gold wasn't really involved with that and maybe you know they had conversations

1366
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,520
prior and they're like I can't really talk about it because I just don't really know anything but

1367
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:17,040
the fact they didn't even ask the question to begin with just like the public can know about that

1368
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:20,960
because like we the public were aware of all sap we're aware of bigelow and all this stuff

1369
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:26,480
why didn't you ask the question at all yeah that was weird the smell test gold was a really nice

1370
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:32,160
well-to-do meaning guy but nasa has been caught lying about UFOs before so then be the most

1371
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:39,920
transparent agency he's ever worked for you know I I'd uh I'd have to agree with that so so Juan

1372
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:46,000
again thank you sir even the hoc are aware aware carl nel is uh first hand yeah an army futures

1373
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:55,440
command and deputy cto of north of bromance that's a guy who should have testified yep yep what uh

1374
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:59,520
what do you make of the idea that nh i may be a component of preventing disclosure I wouldn't

1375
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:04,400
be surprised but I I don't have too much of a thesis there I do like to think back to David

1376
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:09,280
grush talking about agreements with uh with nh i yeah and if there's I mean if there's positive

1377
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:14,240
and negative nh i and you know we can't really figure out what they want to do here it wouldn't

1378
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:18,480
be hard to assume that there's nh i that don't really agree with yeah right from an outside

1379
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:24,160
perspective it's always really difficult for me to attribute uh human motivation to non-human

1380
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:29,920
intelligence yeah are we okay are we heading towards what Reagan spoke of or humanity unites

1381
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:35,280
to fight an outside force listen I think Reagan put plenty of defenses uh plenty of money into

1382
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:39,840
those defenses under the sdi star wars program we had some really good stuff and yeah I think

1383
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:45,440
there's a lot of funds that were given to other programs and used for for uap stuff yeah but I

1384
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:49,600
think kind of coming back to the threat narrative here I think there's there's been some discussion

1385
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:52,960
around that a little bit it just like you know what these things are and how this is going to be

1386
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:57,200
presented to the public I know Reagan's comments were really about like you know what happens if

1387
02:01:57,200 --> 02:02:01,200
an alien threat gets revealed and then like the public you know the world would just unite all

1388
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:06,560
around together yeah I don't really feel like this this is going to happen with this situation I

1389
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:11,120
think that I think disclosure the way it's playing out is is being done in a way that like ensures

1390
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:16,480
like national sovereignty instead of like you know this being like oh shit they're showing up and we

1391
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:21,920
have five years to prepare a type thing like something like from a movie um so yeah it it's

1392
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:25,920
kind of interesting but I don't I don't think it's going to be like this big international

1393
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:30,320
like new world order yeah you know I think really it's just people trying to get to the bottom of

1394
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:36,880
it and a lot of people I think use that to push the um star or blue beam blue beam theory oh yeah

1395
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:42,720
blue beam okay question from truth sauce the video you did about mark mcandellish was awesome

1396
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:48,480
thank you sir any further discussions on uh with the living friend that threatened you

1397
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:54,080
yes and he threatened me again and I found other people who he's threatened as well

1398
02:02:54,800 --> 02:03:01,280
so maybe he needs to be summoned as a hostile witness maybe he needs to be summoned okay

1399
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:06,320
awakening to reality what's up man jonathan thank you for joining looking for the uh looking for the

1400
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:11,280
cues okay yes match part just talked about this remember all four of technologies is mentioned

1401
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:16,320
by herald malmgren in relation to richard the cell I think he specifically said other world

1402
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:24,480
technologies but still and he was uh the cell was cia director as well yep yep okay okay so

1403
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:29,040
long ago when we got claims that people from greerstein the pentagon and co have been opting

1404
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:32,960
funds illegally and estimated two trillion were unaccounted for how can congress get accounts

1405
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:38,160
and tell them about you trying to talk to kathryn austin fits yeah so I mean I reached out to kathryn

1406
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:43,200
a handful of times uh when I was writing my like recent report on the legal financial framework a

1407
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:47,360
lot of the stuff that I kind of pulled and talked about really comes from her salari missing money

1408
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:53,440
dot com website uh very I mean just treasure trove of information about financial covert

1409
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:58,320
operations and stuff like that highly encourage y'all to check that out if you're interested in that

1410
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:05,360
um but now no response from her unfortunately but this estimated two trillion dollars unaccounted

1411
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:12,160
for that still exists um because a lot of people are really aware of this but the department of

1412
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:18,400
defense is now being required to basically go through full independent audits of itself which

1413
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:25,360
it's never really had to do that in its history before up until actually 2017 interesting date um

1414
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:31,600
so and what's interesting is just in the past six and seven years of pentagon audits if you look at

1415
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:37,680
just the money and just kind of the remediations that they've made it is it is a black hole that is

1416
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:41,920
trillions of dollars worth and it's not going away and fits all not gone away fits said it's

1417
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:46,960
not just do d but housing and urban development it's a lot of other agencies yep it was she

1418
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:53,040
I think from her account she saw cumulative four trillion dollars move from department of defense

1419
02:04:53,040 --> 02:05:00,640
and department of uh housing and urban hud sorry hud and do d four trillion cumulative in that one

1420
02:05:00,640 --> 02:05:04,720
year that she was so this is just an interesting thing while we scroll down get to the rest of

1421
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:08,800
the questions none of these guys were whistleblowers um yeah I agree with that in the sense that we

1422
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:13,920
talked about earlier that uh we're both familiar with accounts where people who are planning to

1423
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:18,960
testify have been threatened up to the day of not to and uncertain congressman being a little bit

1424
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:26,800
surprised or expecting kind of mercy or more firsthand people to uh to uh go for okay hey

1425
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:31,360
here's one especially for you kermit have you guys come across the work of trevor james constable

1426
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:35,840
he talked about sky creatures back in 77 and says the movie nope has similarities to his work

1427
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:40,640
I personally haven't but I I'd love to kind of check that out now I also found the movie pretty

1428
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:43,760
interesting I'm gonna have to put that in my notes so thank you for the reference thank you pun

1429
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:48,880
shrink I appreciate I appreciate that a lot for james constable okay sorry we'll look through

1430
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:57,520
more questions um hey thank you john s you rock as well sky creatures so cool uh let's see okay

1431
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:04,720
okay let's see uh so yeah michael made those kind of claims and I I still don't know if there's

1432
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:13,840
any veracity to them um and so forth so weighing boss uh thank you so much for the five bucks why

1433
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:20,960
were no ad runs or ads run against uap caucus members deliberately so is the topic that obscure

1434
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:26,800
I think the topic is that obscure like is this is this saying like during their like when they

1435
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:32,640
were seeking election maybe for uap caucus maybe maybe in the sense of like why are there no

1436
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:38,080
inflammatory posts against guys like lester or uh some of the guys really trying to talk to

1437
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:46,400
staffers and so forth okay got you um I think it's just obscure yeah I will say like the

1438
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:51,280
the congressional hearings were very well attended but I will say you could probably guess who a

1439
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:55,520
majority of the people were there just based off of who talks a lot on twitter and reddit

1440
02:06:55,520 --> 02:07:02,160
but yeah anybody asking about brad brad has given me nothing but yep like yelling at me and all

1441
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:08,880
caps are giving me death threats so leslie gain thought it was disturbing but also had a laugh

1442
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:12,800
with me about it so if you can divulge who are the most interesting people you connected with

1443
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:18,000
at dc it's been a good way to meet movers and shakers the most interesting person not at liberty

1444
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:23,440
to kind of uh talk about that but some of the interesting people uh talking with lou talking

1445
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:32,080
with gallaudet every second okay I made a list of people I talked to so let me go through okay

1446
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:37,440
so lester nair jesse michael's chris from area 52 amar from yes theory tim gallaudet jeremy

1447
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:42,240
corbell michael gold lou elezano james foch merrick von reinenkamp timber chet eric burleson

1448
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:46,640
nancy mace danie sheehan michael schellenberger missleman jack awesome twitter account matt

1449
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:51,360
ford matthew pines leslie cane um and probably a couple more and I got to talk to all these people

1450
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:56,800
yeah right the conversations it we had like a 15 hour day yesterday yeah it was like I mean

1451
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:03,680
started at 7am and then we got back to the hotel at like 10 we were so pooped we were walking back

1452
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:08,400
from the place in which uapdf was held back to our hotel and I think both of us were just kind of

1453
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:14,560
having like a a really surreal experience absolutely I mean yesterday was oh probably one of the most

1454
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:22,960
consequential days I've ever had and true honor I mean we're just we're just two two guys and

1455
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:29,440
we get to uh I'm really proud of the community for kind of stop uh not being so much of a closed

1456
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:34,880
door community and I'm seeing a lot of people Democrats Republicans uh smart lawyers like

1457
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:41,120
Ivan a lot of these people kind of communicating and talking yeah it's a lot of people working

1458
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:47,840
together and it's it's it's very humbling to see it and it's it's very exciting because it's it's a

1459
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:53,440
lot of people that have good motivations and they're inquisitive and they just want the truth

1460
02:08:53,440 --> 02:09:02,720
you know and it's everyone's on the same team um so oh what if we're what if we're a science

1461
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:06,800
experiment or perhaps our existence hinges on us not knowing we're an experiment maybe that's why

1462
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:11,360
they don't want to disclose that's quite possible I mean there are reports even

1463
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:17,920
outside of Bob Lazar of the human genome being tampered with or humans being and I don't want to

1464
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:22,560
count in Zachariah's Sitchin and the the Sumerians because I think there's uh some problems with

1465
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:27,520
those translations but it's a very valid theory yeah I mean Lude talks about in his book he equates

1466
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:32,000
humanity to the 800 pound gorilla in the exhibit right when we steal the tranquilizer gun and then

1467
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:38,800
what happens when we uh knock on the zookeeper's door good question Viagra 500 milligrams I get a

1468
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:44,080
chance to watch NAPS new documentary we had an awkward episode with Michael um no I I have not

1469
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:49,600
seen that yet I that's investigating alien and I will watch it at some point I just I haven't seen

1470
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:56,320
anything besides the trailer uh is that what's this new Dan Farah docus that's being overhyped I

1471
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:59,920
don't know I don't know the do you know anything about the documentary because I've been asked

1472
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:05,120
like multiple times is this person that you talk to in the documentary I'm mostly no what is the

1473
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:10,880
documentary yeah I I don't know too much about it I know it's been kind of talked about in tandem

1474
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:18,320
with Fox's production the program um to my knowledge this Farah films doc is going to feature

1475
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:27,920
like 30 different high level witnesses um 30 30 and the mostly government military I hope so

1476
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:33,760
but I find that I find that tough to however I don't think there's been any communications about

1477
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:38,240
if that documentary has finished what the state of it is and whether or not it's going to be

1478
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:44,560
published I think people I think the rumor was it was supposed to be published before the election

1479
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:49,360
and then it was after the election and then like even still it's just it there's no date on the

1480
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:54,320
calendar yet for it but it it exists it's real and the people that are in the film uh that we

1481
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:59,280
got to shake hands with they talked about it with us they're like yes this is like the Farah film I

1482
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:05,360
was in this whatever um and I think I think even um Michael gold even Michael during the hearing is

1483
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:10,240
like I'm going to talk about it in this uh this documentary that's coming I'm like okay cool like

1484
02:11:10,240 --> 02:11:16,480
we need to see that now so who is Dan Farah that's a good question because I like a documentary

1485
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:22,640
I have no idea I look this up thoughts on project gravitar the new models are doc so I got to talk

1486
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:28,720
at length to Chris from area 52 who just got on Luigi from project gravitar Chris got me really

1487
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:36,800
excited um did did you talk to him at all about gravitar um I no and I told him straight up the

1488
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:41,520
reason I don't really talk about Bob Lazarus because I'm so biased towards Bob that it's difficult

1489
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:46,880
for me to talk about it but he he got me hyped what do you see about Dan uh Dan's a documentary

1490
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:51,520
filmmaker but he also produced movies uh notably ready player one which was okay

1491
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:59,520
movie that aired in theaters 2018 that was one of the movies of all time yeah so as uh I've heard

1492
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:03,120
that another hearing is happening on the 18th or whatever the next hearing is may you do I think

1493
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:07,440
this is more a Senate hearing on arrows specifically so don't get your hopes up about that that's

1494
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:13,600
going to be probably pretty dry it will be interesting to see how Kosolowski discusses kind

1495
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:18,400
of the the arrows kind of operations you can comparing that back to how Kirk Patrick's made

1496
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:23,280
those statements will answer five more and then and then we'll wrap up truth so I hated the comment

1497
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:28,320
about some guy in a Winnebago the same thing happening now happens in the 40s 50s including the

1498
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:35,920
52 flap uh who said who said that I that was uh that was the comment about like the credibility

1499
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:40,240
of the witnesses like you guys aren't all just bunch of people living in a Winnebago that was

1500
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:44,400
that was the comment oh to make fun of people going like to see craft outside of area 51

1501
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:48,960
all the guys would get into something like something like that maybe I thought it was in

1502
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:54,720
the context of like they were at like one of the representatives asked Elizondo like what his um

1503
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:58,480
what his career kind of wasn't like what his experience was and it was like the point of like

1504
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:03,360
okay you're not just like some crackpot in Winnebago okay well yeah needs to stop getting

1505
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:07,360
names thrown around like crackpot ancient aliens or youtube being left on the stick but just needs

1506
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:12,320
to stop yeah like Jimmy says thoughts on the document from Sarbakar on Oppenheimer von Neumann

1507
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:17,520
being involved with crash retrievals I've covered Sarbakar very often and I think he's an extremely

1508
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:23,760
credible individual you're pretty familiar with Sarbakar too right ish okay yeah I I would I put

1509
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:28,160
a lot of I yeah but I am not surprised there especially because he's mentioned him at other

1510
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:33,200
times as well uh let's see truth sauce did that bother you shouldn't these congress people be

1511
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:37,920
more well informed for the same nuclear base incursions okay I understand your your comment

1512
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:43,120
now in this context yes of course that bothers me I hate the name calling the throwing around

1513
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:47,680
there's rude snide comments I hear outside and it's just what we do it Kermit just talked about

1514
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:56,480
the byproduct of the stigma being so darn successful yeah uh okay let's uh let's go through uh see

1515
02:13:56,480 --> 02:14:02,080
awakening see a man Winnebago catching strays uh okay we'll do this one and then one more question

1516
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:06,240
if one pops up while we're talking what are your thoughts on abductions uh this is still a difficult

1517
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:13,520
question I love the work of John Mack uh it's difficult for me to connect abductions to what

1518
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:18,480
I'd say my bread and butter is which is crash retrieval reverse engineering and witness testimony

1519
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:25,840
analysis so uh the abductions are fascinating then there's a lot of witnesses under a career

1520
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:31,120
that talk about human abductions for my lab purposes and so forth one witness in specific

1521
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:37,600
10 8 9 2 and his witness log uh I need to do more due diligence and read more of John Mack's book

1522
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:42,640
because I'm not closed off to the idea I'm just ill informed yeah I'm kind of in the same boat I mean

1523
02:14:42,640 --> 02:14:47,840
again my my bread and butter is the excel file that is the classified balance sheet and trying to see

1524
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:55,120
that um but in terms of abductions like my thoughts of it is like you know kind of backed with Mack is

1525
02:14:55,120 --> 02:15:00,560
like Mack's kind of uh thesis of it is like you know these people are you know genuine they have

1526
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:05,200
these experiences and they're telling like an accurate genuine account of their experience

1527
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:08,880
now is that something that's happening physically like are they being physically taking from the

1528
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:13,200
space and put into a spaceship or is this happening like within their mind of like they're

1529
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:17,040
having this like experience within consciousness so they don't really understand but in their

1530
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:20,720
brain they think it's like an abduction event you know it could be something like both but what I

1531
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:25,920
will say is I'm kind of a you know I come from a Catholic background so I do fundamentally believe

1532
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:29,280
in things like you know possession demonic possession things like that and I think that

1533
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:34,320
there is a little bit of tie-in between those two things I wouldn't be surprised okay we got uh

1534
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:39,680
three two more and we'll go through it or truth sauce three more we talked about we talked about

1536
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:51,840
it this weekend okay perfect perfect uh damply dude says do you think uh do you think about UFOs

1537
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:55,520
and aliens make them aware of you I think it's quite possible in any scenario the longer you

1538
02:15:55,520 --> 02:16:00,480
stare into the void the more it stares back that's one of the best realms of cosmic horror so I think

1539
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:05,680
it's it's uh quite possible I've been told by some uh close friends you know not necessarily

1540
02:16:05,680 --> 02:16:10,080
experiencers but just like the the hitchhiker effect it will now be in play once you get
