0	5280	So Lockheed Martin wanted to divest itself from this material at a specific facility
5280	10680	that's known to me that I provided to the inspector general, um, like street address,
10680	12680	all that shit, right?
12680	17920	And the idea was if they made a catcher's mitt, a security catcher's mitt for this shit,
17920	23560	you know, most serious set possible, the contractor and the other government customer, which was
23560	29040	the central intelligence agency, um, for that specific Lockheed material.
29040	31480	And it was shit that they recovered from like the fifties and stuff.
31480	36440	It was like bits and pieces of, of, of, of like hall structure or shit like that.
36440	41200	How could in, so if an aerospace, and I've heard this theory from very informed people,
41200	42200	I don't think it's a theory.
42200	48360	It sounds true that if there are crash materials and apparently there, there are those reside
48360	52440	in the custody of not the US government, but of contractors that work for the US government
52440	54680	aerospace defense contract, right?
54680	60600	McDonald Douglas, Lockheed, et cetera.
60600	65040	My kids actually asked the same question and whenever I go on to business trips, I come
65040	66640	home to ask me, how are the aliens?
66640	68040	Did I see the aliens?
68040	69040	Things like that.
69040	70720	So yeah, do the aliens exist?
70720	75120	That's a question for another time, but in terms of what we work on, yes, we do work
75120	77440	on classified projects.
77440	82600	In the field of ufology, Lockheed Martin, the US's biggest and most advanced aerospace
82600	87920	and defense corporation, has been intimately woven with the study of UFOs.
87920	92720	From reverse engineering attempts to material storage, Lockheed's name comes up again and
92720	97960	again and again, and is specifically name dropped by credible individuals like David
97960	100680	Grush and Gary Nolan, who we just saw.
100680	103200	My friends, let's waste no time.
103200	109520	I am your host, UAPGurve, and join me today as we analyze Lockheed Martin's deep history
109520	114920	of UFOs and utilize facts and records to uncover this infamous piece of the military
114920	119280	industrial complex's true involvement with the phenomenon.
119280	126080	In 2021, late former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said during a New York Times interview,
126080	131560	quote, I was told for decades that Lockheed had some of these retrieved materials.
131560	136340	I tried to get, as I recall, a classified approval by the Pentagon to have me go look
136340	137560	at the stuff.
137560	139320	They would not approve that.
139320	143840	I don't know what all the numbers were, what kind of classification it was, but they would
143840	145880	not give that to me.
145880	150680	Before we try and uncover what Senator Reid was referencing, let's review some of Lockheed's
150680	155020	accomplishments, so we understand just how advanced this company is.
155020	161040	With annual revenues around the 60s of billions of US dollars, over half of Lockheed's annual
161040	167400	sales go to, of course, the DOD and DOE, and has completed feats of military engineering
167440	174440	marvels, such as the creation of the SR-71 Blackbird, the F-22 Raptor, the F-16, and
174440	177000	the F-17 Nighthawk.
177000	182280	Lockheed has also contributed greatly to the space age of man, creating space shuttle
182280	188760	propellants, designing manned maneuvering units for spacewalks, and landed key contributions
188760	192120	to satellite creations, and much, much more.
192120	197960	And we are all deeply familiar with the famed Skunkworks division that is intertwined with
197960	202840	DOD's special access programs, where top secret projects are conducted that result
202840	209560	in vehicles that fly at Mach 3.2 at 100,000 feet, such as the SR-71, or the production
209560	213160	of the first stealth fighter in the F-117.
213160	219240	But what about projects deeper, or in an even more classified setting than the already shadowy
219240	220760	Skunkworks?
220840	225880	Lockheed Martin is legendary for having so much lore and whistleblowers surrounding the
225880	232200	company's Black Division, but with an astonishingly thin paper trail and available evidence.
232200	236920	You know me guys, we will do whatever it takes to critically analyze and separate fact from
236920	241720	fiction, but going into this know that we don't have the same sort of records available
241720	243800	to us as we did for Battelle.
243800	250440	Lockheed Martin was not working closely with USAF and ATIC to investigate UFOs, and we don't
250440	255960	have an exact paper trail of when Lockheed got UAP material or craft.
255960	259240	So we will have to do our best to analyze all of the evidence.
263640	269480	We'll start by reviewing some of the perplexing claims made by actual Lockheed Martin employees
269480	274520	and head scientists, and yes, there are multiple and quite a few to review.
274520	279000	Most who are familiar with Lockheed's connection to UFOs know about Ben Rich.
279000	283160	The second Lockheed Skunkworks director and the father of the F-117.
283880	290840	Just I'm sure as you guys know about his famed 1993 UCLA speech, where he allegedly stated,
290840	295160	quote, we already have the means to travel among the stars.
295160	300360	But these technologies are locked up in Black projects, and it would take an act of God
300360	302760	to ever get them out to benefit humanity.
303400	306600	Anything you can imagine, we already know how to do.
307320	312360	I'm not here to push any unsubstantiated claims to back my thesis, guys.
312360	318040	So did you know there's actually no video or audio evidence of Ben saying this?
318040	322520	This is not to claim this quote is fabricated or that Rich wasn't interested in UFOs,
323080	326120	but these quotes are recorded by author Linda Moulton-Howell,
326120	329160	who is known to take some report of liberties.
329160	335400	However, this exact quote appears to be confirmed in a 2010 MUFON article by one Tom Keller.
335880	339560	But quite the contrary, on the 10th of July 1986,
340360	345800	one John Alexander wrote to director Rich to expand on his statement of being a, quote,
345800	351880	believer in UFOs. Andrew proposes that there are two categories of UFO and is interested
351880	355880	to get Rich's thoughts, man-made and extraterrestrial vehicles.
356760	360120	In a response letter, Ben Rich replies, quote,
360120	363720	Dear John, yes, I'm a believer in both categories.
364360	369000	I feel everything is possible. Many of our man-made UFOs are unfunded opportunities.
369720	373000	In both categories, there are a lot of kooks and charlatans.
373000	375240	Be cautious. Best regards, Ben Rich.
375800	380360	Guys, please give me a congratulations for being able to decipher that cursive. It was not easy.
381400	387000	The only discussion I can find around Rich's mentioned UCLA speech are some remarks made by
387080	392840	MUFON director Jan Harzan, who actually attended the conference and can confirm some things that
392840	398120	Rich said. He ended his talk with a slide of a black disc zipping off an outer space.
398920	403960	And he ended it with these words, we now have the technology to take ET home.
405080	408760	And the entire place broke up laughing. And Tom and I just looked at each other and said,
408760	413720	did he really just say that? And are these people really not getting that what he's saying is real?
413720	417240	So someone else asked the same question. So finally he just said, he said, well,
417240	420600	he said, let me ask you a question. Do you think it's possible to travel to the stars?
421160	424040	He asked this about a particular engineer who had asked him a question about his career.
424680	427800	And the engineer said, well, I don't know, it just took a long time to get there.
427800	433640	He said, no, it wouldn't. We've found an error in the equations and we now know how to travel to
433640	439720	the stars. So we can't really confirm or deny Rich's supposed disclosure, but we can say that he
439720	445720	did have an interest and understanding of man made versus non human intelligence UFOs.
446360	450600	And next we have Don Phillips, who was an ex Lockheed Skunkworks,
450600	456520	USAF and CIA contractor who told his story through Steven Greer's disclosure project in 2001.
457400	461960	And this is when Greer was still doing largely respectable work to push disclosure.
462600	467880	Phillips directly claimed that Lockheed has extraterrestrial technology and quote,
467880	472200	tremendous technological advances have come from their study.
472200	478680	He also claimed in his interview with Greer, the US military did in fact acquire UFO craft from
478680	486040	Roswell Lockheed, quote, really did put the technology to work. And Lockheed was intimately
486040	492200	involved with anti gravity research. All of these things Phillips claimed. But frustratingly,
492760	497720	vetting Phillips claimed background with Skunkworks and CIA has proved to be impossible for me.
498280	505400	The only mention of Phillips I can find is a paper clipping from July 29, 1965,
505400	510440	which confirms Phillips role in the Air Force as well as mentions him as a graduate of Pierce
510440	515960	College. And fun fact guys, this is the same college that we can actually factually verify
515960	522520	Bob Lazar went to. So analyze Phillips statements as you will. Personally, I view his role with
522520	528120	Lockheed from a skeptical lens. I need verifiable proof that his role within the company was
528120	533880	legitimate before I can judge more. However, some of the things he says about anti gravity,
533880	540040	Roswell and reverse engineering UAP technology lines up almost exactly with some of the other
540040	545320	gentlemen we're going to hear from. And next we move on to a controversial but very verifiable
545400	552520	figure, Boyd Bushman. Bushman's deathbed claims of working on UAP R&D for Lockheed released in
552520	560520	2014 and have become stuff of legend for UFO researchers. In this video, Boyd states that
560520	567880	debris and materials were recovered from crash recoveries plural in New Mexico, likely Roswell
567880	574120	and maybe the Kingman Arizona crash. He comments on the company's work with anti gravity and states
574120	582280	his work on UAP craft concluded that these craft contain three key elements in their makeup,
582280	589000	telluride, germanium and palladium. Worthy to note is that these materials Bushman suggests
589000	596600	comprised UAP could be used to create a thermoelectrical slash photovoltaic generator with a semiconductor
596600	602360	and capacitor as pure germanium was the first metallic material to become a superconductor
602360	608680	in the presence of an electromagnetic field. Palladium is crucial to capacitors and telluride
608680	614600	alloys have thermoelectric or photovoltaic properties. This isn't crucial to know you don't
614600	619720	need to be a material scientist but this sort of material science led some credence to what
619720	624360	Bushman claimed. Please feel free to view the whole testimony, of course the video will be in
624360	631560	the description but I want to focus on Bushman himself. Boyd is a verified senior specialist
631640	638440	and top secret SEI SAP cleared employee that served in Lockheed department 610-8,
638440	646040	the special programs division. In 1999, Bushman came under FBI investigation for suspicious foreign
646040	652120	contact. Lockheed became concerned about the potential of Boyd sharing sensitive information
652120	658680	with what appears to be contacts in Prague and it's unknown if all of this contact was UAP related
659640	664760	but from our investigation it looks like Boyd was contacting members in Prague to learn more
664760	671640	about anti-gravity. Bushman was awarded numerous patents including strangely in 1997
672360	678360	a patent for a device that creates a magnetic monopole beam that emits pulses, levitates,
678360	684680	degausses, stops electronics and separates materials. Monopoles currently are not proven
684680	691160	to exist in the public or physics sector and are an incredibly interesting topic. I recommend
691160	695720	checking out this video by PBS spacetime if you want to learn more about magnetic monopoles
696360	703080	but Boyd was the real deal right? Well yeah except for the alien bodies he showed in photographs.
703960	710440	The tiny looking gray creature can be traced back to a toy model originally claimed by an above
710520	718440	top secret forum thread in 2008 to be a Kmart Halloween decoration from the late 1990s. No
718440	723320	verifiable evidence can be drawn to the toys listing however this is not a great look for
723320	729480	Bushman. Whether purposeful or accidental disinformation I'm not sure but with the presence
729480	735720	of the two we are faced with three options that some government agency had some toy company that
735720	743160	made models make up alien toys that appeared similar to the real aliens that resided in Area 51
743160	748520	or Groom Lake so that if photos were ever leaked like they were with Bushman they could leak photos
748520	755080	of the toy as a way to discredit any whistleblower. Option two is that the photo of the model alien
755080	760040	was given to Bushman in order to discredit him and take away from his story and three of course
760840	766920	Boyd purposefully pushed the photo of the toy for whatever reason and now we arrive to the last
766920	771640	and probably the best and most credible speaker with regards to employment in Lockheed, Bernard
771640	778520	Haish. PhD astrophysicist Haish performed astonishing work for Lockheed including the
778520	783640	publishing of a paper for the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center with physicist Hal
783640	790120	Putoff. The paper focused on zero point energy of the quantum vacuum. The study specifically
790120	795800	looked at one or more resonant frequencies that may be associated with quantum vacuum interaction
795800	800840	for propulsion purposes. I'll mention this again soon so keep that study in mind.
801720	809560	In 2001 Haish wrote an essay titled Black Special Access Programs. He had created a site
809560	816040	called UFOSkeptic.org. Don't let this site name fool you he just wanted scientists to come together
816040	821480	to analyze UAP with a little bit more of a critical lens. To respect our time I am just
821480	826200	going to summarize this article I'm not going to read the whole thing but Haish essentially confirms
826200	831400	the world we came to know in 2023 with the revelations of David Grush that these black
831400	836840	special access programs on crash retrieval and reverse engineering can be quite independent
836840	842920	of any given administration and it's unrealistic to think that Freedom of Information Act requests
842920	849880	and even presidential administrations can penetrate and read into these programs that over time these
849880	856840	black budget programs become extremely independent and to trace their origin instead of intelligence
856840	862120	they most likely fall under the office of the Undersecretary for Defense for Acquisition Technology
862120	867640	and Logistics. What is even more astounding however are the comments Haish made to the public
867640	873960	in 2018 after the existence of ATIP was revealed to the American public. He said quote the following
873960	880120	is conjecture sources tell me that this is merely the tip of the iceberg a group of four related but
880120	887400	separate unacknowledged SCI programs tracing back to a 1947 Truman memorandum still exist and were
887400	893320	housed as of the 1990s guys remember the Wilson Davis Memo and the reorganization of SAPs in that
893320	899800	time in major aerospace companies such as for example Lockheed, TRW, Raytheon, Aerospace Corps,
899800	905000	etc these would be expensive programs since the cost of secrecy can be several times higher than
905000	911480	research the ATIP program has no relation to these four much better funded deep black ones
911480	916760	indeed the black programs collectively have budgets in the 10 billion range and up topics
916760	922040	apparently include both reverse engineering and extraterrestrial biology the ATIP did find
922040	927240	the UFO crash retrieval program via official channels but was denied access to it because
927240	933720	ATIP itself is not a SAP. Senator Harry Reid petitioned the DOD to confer SAP status to ATIP
933720	940520	but the DOD denied his request and lastly guys while not a Lockheed employee let's take a look at
940520	946200	USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fausch. Fausch has made some astounding statements on Lockheed with
946200	952600	some really weird evidence to back it. In 1998 the Master Sergeant states he temporarily worked
952600	959720	at the Defense Advanced Research Center, DARSE, in 1979 which he claims is a facility beneath
959720	965240	Groom Lake with at least 10 underground stories. Fausch states he was recruited to DARSE while
965240	971080	working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base. He claimed that triangular craft
971080	977000	had been reverse engineered by UAP contracted by none other than Lockheed Martin. The Sergeant
977000	983320	coined the now famous term the TR-3B which is synonymous with human-made reverse engineered
983320	988760	triangular shaped craft and states three prototypes have been reverse engineered by efforts at
988760	994680	Sandia and Livermore dating back to the early 1990s and was the first attempt at a gravity
994680	1001240	warping craft. What is truly wild here is we can confirm not only Fausch's military record but also
1001240	1008360	the fact he was actually stationed at the famed Area 51. Look here guys Ed was assigned to Debt-3
1008360	1014120	AFFTC which is the organization at the Air Force Flight Test Center responsible for operations
1014120	1021160	at Area 51 Groom Lake but of course Ed's line because the DARSE, the Defense Advanced Research
1021160	1027400	Center is not part of DARPA right? Well look guys a declassified study from the Advanced Research
1027400	1034120	Project Agency ARPA shows advanced aerospace projects were performed by Warner Von Braun's team
1034120	1041560	at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency ABMA. A draft by the DOD directive shows the ABMA was
1041560	1048760	considered for a transfer into a quote defense advanced research center that would be inherently
1048760	1054120	linked to JPL. It's unconfirmed if DARSE was actually created and if any advanced
1054120	1060440	aerospace concepts from Von Braun made their way there but look guys DARSE is actually a theoretical
1060440	1070440	place. As mentioned by Bushman, Haish, and Phillips Lockheed has engaged with some incredibly
1070440	1076120	strange and exotic technologies that appear like they're straight out of science fiction.
1076120	1082280	Can we confirm any of this work like anti-gravity or strange propulsion methods?
1083080	1091000	Well in 1955 physicist Lou Witten states that he was recruited by one George Trimble the current
1091000	1097160	VP for aviation and advanced propulsion systems at the Glenn L. Martin Company. The Glenn L.
1097160	1103640	Martin Company eventually evolved into Martin Marietta which merged with Lockheed in 95.
1103640	1109080	Anyways Witten states that he was recruited into the Research Institute for Advanced Studies,
1109080	1117480	the RIAS. Witten stated that Trimble recruited him to help develop anti-gravity and in 2013
1117480	1124920	actually stated that the team discovered techniques to harness anti-gravity in this project. Witten
1124920	1131080	suggested several ideas were tested including utilizing an isotope of bismuth but he does not
1131080	1136680	expand on this. And shocking enough we actually have the journal evidence to prove that this
1136680	1141800	research took place. And if you want to see Lou Witten talk about this look at the link I've
1141800	1149240	provided and go to about an hour 49-22. The anti-gravity rabbit hole runs deep way deeper than
1149240	1154680	the discussion by Bushman Phillips and Fausch. I'll cover this in another time guys because
1154680	1161080	the anti-gravity starting on about 1955 this research is fascinating. But remember how I
1161080	1167320	mentioned in 1998 Hesh and Putoff published a paper on zero point energy in the quantum vacuum?
1167320	1172680	If you don't know real fast zero point energy is the lowest possible energy level or ground state
1172680	1177400	in a quantized electromagnetic field which interacts with a physical system of particles.
1178040	1183640	In a quantum vacuum vacuums must always crackle with fluctuations in the quantum field that fill
1184040	1189800	these never-ending fluctuations imbue every field with some minimum amount of energy known as the
1189800	1194680	zero point energy. Guys you don't need to pay attention to that just know that this is pretty
1194680	1201560	breakthrough stuff but theoretically impossible zero point energy. But if you look to 2017 inventor
1201560	1207800	Salvador Pais and the naval air station were awarded a patent for a similar concept for a
1207800	1213800	triangular shaped craft that utilize specific frequencies to interact with the quantum vacuum
1213800	1222040	and generate anti-gravitic capabilities. Sounds like UAP right? Well on the 22nd of August 1998
1222040	1227320	now retired Lieutenant Colonel Ron Blackburn of Lockheed Martin Skunkworks and co-founder of the
1227320	1234680	ATP group at BDM International was awarded a patent for technology that increased aerodynamic
1234680	1240680	and hydrodynamic efficiency of a vehicle in motion that includes a sketch of a disc.
1241320	1246680	Several years later Blackburn states on a podcast he reverse engineered the capabilities to eliminate
1246680	1253880	sonic booms at high speeds by using videos of disc-shaped craft he had access to. Guys think
1253880	1260040	about this this has multiple of the observables of UAP by Lou Elizondo the ability to operate in
1260040	1265240	trans-medium remember the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic efficiency as well as travel at
1265240	1270200	mock speeds without the presence of a sonic boom this sounds like UAP technology.
1274760	1281320	Guys this is a UAP group video so let's analyze all the documents we can. Believe it or not Lockheed
1281320	1288600	has had some interesting encounters with official USG record keeping such as this 1953 UFO sighting
1288680	1293800	where Lockheed test pilots and ground crew observe a flying disc with anomalous acceleration
1293800	1301000	characteristics three men also swore this sighting as testimony the sighting was submitted to
1301000	1307960	bluebook but was never listed again curiously and guys think back to my video on the Wilson Davis
1307960	1314040	memo where Wilson Davis states the watch committee of the Black UFO crash retrieval and reverse
1314040	1319640	engineering program he discovered within the SAP logs told him they were almost outed due to an
1319640	1328120	audit well check this out guys on the 24th of July 1986 the director of the US general accounting
1328120	1335080	office GAO's national security and international affairs division Frank C. Conahan testified
1335080	1341080	at a subcommittee on oversight and investigation Conahan stated that Lockheed exhibited a poor
1341080	1347880	document control system over classified special access documents and had zero oversight from the
1347880	1354120	DOD program office it was then that the GAO stated the defense investigation service was
1354120	1360920	actually not allowed to conduct the semi-annual inspects of the aerospace contract in question
1360920	1369880	and 1460 discrepancies were found in an inventory of 40 000 documents with Lockheed an estimated 46
1369880	1374920	documents were destroyed and 17 were transferred out of the company and were never discovered
1375640	1381160	guys this sounds extremely suspicious the poor document control system of Lockheed and somehow
1381160	1389880	missing 46 documents and a full 1460 discrepancies well this strangeness and Lockheed's hand in deep
1389880	1397240	special access programs above even DOD oversight does not end here in June of 2004 former assistant
1397240	1402920	secretary of housing and urban development Catherine Austin Fitz wrote a paper titled The Black
1402920	1409640	Budget of the United States this paper says that quote a large proportion of the nation's wealth
1409640	1416600	is being illegally diverted into secret unaccountable channels to support clandestine domestic
1416600	1422440	military r&d she states she discovered evidence that Lockheed Martin information systems were
1422440	1429480	responsible for the obfuscation of justice and may have data on the siphon DOD funds Lockheed at
1429480	1435160	this time was one of the subcontractors to IBM as hired by the Pentagon to manage systems that
1435160	1441240	failed a GAO audit so we have to think all of this taking place all of Lockheed's kind of
1441240	1448200	shadiness around DOD and mistracking of funds are they involved with the audit as spoke about in
1448200	1455560	the Wilson Davis memo and to add the icing on top here guys in 2000 commander Will Miller yes the
1455560	1461320	same Miller from the Wilson Davis memo told attorney Peter Gersten that senior government
1461320	1468680	officials such as a DIA director are isolated from UAP knowledge quote the keepers of the secrets
1468680	1477240	reside in DOD middle management and civilian contractors like SAIC Boeing and Lockheed and
1477240	1482760	are basically the comptrollers who monitor the flow of money to certain classified and special
1482760	1495880	access programs black triangles are a legendary shape of UFO seen for decades and are the responsible
1495880	1501560	craft behind the 1989 Belgian UFO wave well what if I told you that there's a paper trail of evidence
1501560	1508920	that suggests this black triangle commonly known as the TR3B is actually a Lockheed Martin UAP
1508920	1517240	reverse engineering program called project Astra Aurora the first mention we can find of Aurora is
1517240	1524600	in the Department of Defense's fiscal year 1986 and 1987 where 80 million was planned to be spent
1524600	1532040	on an Aurora program in 86 and 2.3 billion in 87 for reference this was more than double the cost
1532040	1539240	of the b2 spirit bomber in fact in 1997 John Greenwald of the black vault inquired into Aurora
1539240	1546520	but was denied any sort of access then in the late 1990s we can go back to author Nick Cook of the
1546520	1552120	hunt for zero point who interviewed former head of Lockheed Martin Skunkworks Jack Gordon while
1552120	1558040	leading the plant in Palmdale Nick Cook saw a large chart illustrating the lineage of every
1558040	1564920	Skunkworks aircraft since the XP80 past the Dark Star which is the plane in the film Top Gun Maverick
1564920	1570680	there was something called Astra an ultra high-speed reconnaissance craft that looked triangular in
1570680	1577480	shape and it looked similar to some of the triangle seen in Belgium in the early 90s and when Cook
1577480	1583640	asked Gordon was flustered and denied Astra was anything but an old airliner and while we're
1583640	1588440	here let's not forget about the triangle shaped craft Fausch claimed Lockheed possession was actively
1588440	1595160	reverse engineering at Darse and do you guys remember the release of the Calvin UFO photo in
1595160	1603720	2022-2023 which was taken in Scotland and depicts a large triangle diamond shaped UFO that was
1603720	1609800	referenced by the British Ministry of Defense well if you look closely at former project Condon
1609800	1616760	that was the Ministry of Defense's official UFO investigation program the Calvin UFO photo is listed
1616760	1624200	as Astra slash Aurora photos among other 35 millimeter slides that don't appear on this last
1624200	1631800	file this could be very significant as in this same M.O.D. Condon report the Brits were interested
1631880	1639480	in investigating UAP sourced from USG contractor projects and this Aurora slash Astra may be listed
1639480	1644840	here was even more interesting to note this Condon report took special interest of triangle
1644840	1650600	sightings as seen here in the executive summary page of the report and it appears the British
1650600	1657800	had taken a keen interest in Aurora or Astra as a USG UAP triangle craft reverse engineered
1657800	1663480	because back in the 22nd of December 1992 the British Embassy in Washington DC
1663480	1669960	wrote to a assistant chief of air staff in London regarding the USG's reaction to triangular UAP
1669960	1676360	citing specifically a sighting that occurred three years earlier by a British royal observer
1676360	1683800	core member this investigation into USAF caused quote considerable irritation by the Brits and
1683800	1688200	the British officials who monitored the USG reaction are quoted as saying Secretary of the
1688200	1695000	Air Force Donald B. Rice was to say the least incensed by the renewed speculation that he had
1695000	1701320	lied to Congress by stating that Aurora did not exist so as we can see guys a lot more work needs
1701320	1706840	to be done investigating Aurora slash Astra but these strings connect triangular shaped craft to
1706840	1712680	both Lockheed Martin and USAF and that the British M.O.D had a keen interest in finding out what the
1712680	1718600	heck these things were. What's up guys I hope you enjoyed this look into Lockheed Martin and UAPs
1719400	1724200	as you can see after watching this video there are a ton of public figures who make
1724200	1730520	pretty bold claims about Lockheed and while these claims are most likely true as confirmed by Grush
1730520	1737640	and other key people it's really hard to actually get to the bottom of this if you see our paper
1737640	1745400	trail is not exceedingly long we have Lockheed Martin interacting with Blue Book in the 50s and
1745400	1752680	we have our audit trail that you know very likely is involved with the audit mentioned in the Wilson
1752680	1759640	Davis memo that the watch committee had to basically reorganize SAP status in the 90s to
1760680	1766760	hide themselves better but what do you guys think is is Lockheed as much of a player in
1766760	1772360	the reverse engineering and material exploitation of UAP as Patel I personally think so yes but
1772920	1779000	they are just a lot harder to track down as our nation's largest defense contractor I imagine
1779000	1784120	they have some pretty darn good record systems too keep stuff like this out what did you guys
1784120	1790280	think of the witnesses I'd say order of most credible to least credible we got Bernard Haish
1790520	1797320	Boyd Bushman and Don Phillips Don Phillips it's unfortunate I can't verify his background so
1797320	1803240	it's really hard for me to take his word as gospel Boyd Bushman a really interesting witness says
1803240	1810520	some interesting things but the toy alien I more analysis needs to be done there but quite frankly
1810520	1817080	I'm not sure where to go from there but in addition the Aurora Astra could be its own
1817080	1822680	hour long documentary but I just wanted to do a a summary an overview of what's going on because
1822680	1831720	there's a lot more to Aurora Astra including aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish seen something
1831720	1837160	called the TR3B or the triangular shaped craft in Lockheed Martin while leaving a facility and so
1837160	1841480	forth so there's a lot more to dive into guys maybe I'll do that someday but I need a little bit
1841480	1846280	more information on Aurora Astra some concrete information to make another video because this
1846280	1852040	video is a lot of speculation for for what I like pushing the boundaries of speculation versus fact
1853000	1861160	but this was an exhausting list of facts and data to make so please give a like and subscribe and I
1861160	1867960	will catch you guys on the next show and before you go in victory or defeat I support the best
1867960	1871320	athlete in the world Alexander Volkanovsky goodbye everybody
