0	12240	What is up guys? What is going on? Are we live? I think so. Let's see. Somebody let me know in
12240	21360	the comments if we are live and you can hear me. Okay, cool. I think we are. Let's see. David,
21360	24720	have some names for me to check out. Let me just start, read that right away because that's
24720	31040	interesting. Cecil B. Scott Brown is a very interesting character. He is named throughout a
31040	36960	lot of Stephen Greer's files and in Grant Cameron's research of Dr. Eric A. Walker,
37600	44480	both Cameron and Dr. C. B. Scott Brown wrote to University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Eric Walker
44480	49840	to talk to him. I think C. B. Scott Brown is no longer with us, but that is a very interesting
49840	56240	person to research and look into. But hey guys, thanks for joining today. This should be a fun
56240	63280	stream. I got some pretty fun stuff to talk about today. Of course, it's been a busy week in the
63280	72960	field of ufology and also we missed last Sunday. I was out of town, so we're going to do the 10K
72960	78400	stream today. And part of the stream today, I want to share a little bit of some ongoing research
78400	84000	I'm doing. That kind of ties into the UAPDA. I think everybody watching will find that very
84000	89920	interesting because I sure did. And I'm really excited to see that. Let's see a couple questions.
89920	95760	Kai, I'm sorry about the Browns. I really am, man. Maybe come over to the Bengals, bro. We got a bit
95760	102720	better of a squad. Chris, I did see what happened with Grant Cameron and Dick Cheney. Grant Cameron
102720	109920	is a fantastic researcher. I've been combing his files, the Grant Cameron files, for more stuff on
109920	115920	Dick Cheney because as I talked about in my last video, Grant Cameron released his entire trove of
115920	122000	UFO files from his decades of research. There is so much there. I haven't even begun to kind of
122000	127280	filter through everything. As you guys know, we go through the Stephen Greer DPI archive here and
127280	130800	then we'll do the Grant Cameron files as well because there's a lot of interesting stuff there.
131520	138240	And Mighty Mo, yes, you are on time. Are there any interesting retrievals that have happened in the
138240	145040	UK or nearby? Yes. There are some incidents in the 70s and 80s. A couple in England. Let me get
145040	151520	out the handbook real fast and find those out. We got that crash retrievals. Magic Eye is only
151520	156880	on us. There's two cases that come to mind in England. Of course, there's the rental from Forest
156880	165360	Landing. So, M1138T, if you're listening to me, write down these dates. Garleton, England, July 16,
165360	173120	1963. Let me keep going. Pencrige, England, February or March of 1964.
177200	182560	Walt, I'm sorry, I cannot speak. Walthamstow, England, April 13, 1964.
183120	192000	Cambridge, Shire, England, January of 1965. And if you want to count North Wales, Burwin Mountains,
192000	198960	North Wales, 74, around the same time of the Kuyame alleged incident. So, those are a couple
198960	205040	examples. And if you want a more recent example, I would look in 1991, July, and Cheadle, Stafford,
205760	212640	Shire, England. This is about, this is close to 1992, the alleged Long Island, New York case,
212640	216640	which if you guys don't know that one, that's going to be a case we feature as it supposedly
216640	223840	occurred on Long Island, New York, 1992, near Brookhaven Labs. Okay. Hey, look, man, I don't say
223840	229840	bad words. I keep it clean on this channel, but you know, the Steelers are worse. The Steelers are
229840	238080	worse. What's up? Good to see you, Dr. Doc. Looking to see B. Scott Brown. I have not heard
238080	242800	of Carol Rosen or Bryce DeWitt. I have heard of Bryce DeWitt. Yes, we've talked about the
242800	248400	Nepal Retrieval in Kathmandu in 68 in Moondust, quite a long time ago as well. That's such an
248400	254320	interesting case. I was compiling some documents on Moondust for somebody the other day. And that,
254320	262240	of course, was a case I sent over. What's up? What's up, dude? Broad and North. Thank you so
262240	268080	much for the 200 Norwegian crown. I really appreciate that, man. You're the man. I love it. Thank you
268080	276480	so much. Something or someone. So Grant Cameron is, he has a website that's called Presidential UFO.
276480	280480	Grant Cameron has been really instrumental kind of before the age of John Greenwald and so forth
280480	286080	in utilizing Freedom of Information Act requests and the National Archives to kind of find hidden
287440	293360	files and letters on various individuals. This includes Wilbur B. Smith. This includes Dr.
293360	299440	Eric K. Walker. This includes President Johnson. So Grant Cameron, of course, had early in the
299440	306480	2000s, 2001, called into a radio show asking Dick Cheney outright, inquiring as to his involvement
306480	311520	with UAP programs in USG. And he just said something along the lines of, if I was briefed on
311520	316400	that, I probably couldn't talk about it. Darth Cheney is correct. Thoughts on Jay Stratton's
316400	321600	upcoming book. I think it'll be interesting. There seems to be a lot of drama boiling over with Jay
321600	329920	and Lou and the whole ATIP, all SAP stuff. So we shall see how that goes. As an American, I usually
329920	334320	only see English UAP media. Do you know of any good translated resources or channels covering
334320	340880	any other countries, particularly Asia? I do not, actually. I do not know of any kind of
342080	347120	channels that cover Asian materials. I would be particularly interested to hear about
347120	351600	the history of crash retrievals in China. Of course, there's American sources of many
351600	357040	crash retrieval cases in Cambodia, Vietnam, and so forth in the Vietnam War or conflict. But
357040	362960	that is well worth checking out. I would also like to look into these. Could I also use metric
362960	368160	units in my video? Yes, I will. I'm an American, but remember, I'm schooled as an engineer. So
368160	374240	metric units are near and dear to my heart. I absolutely will. I always face this predicament.
374240	379200	I always face this predicament. What is your MMA record? I have never fought an actual
379200	383440	sanctioned mixed martial arts fight, but earlier this year, I did participate in a
383440	389920	Giju Jitsu tournament and took third place in the heavyweight division.
390160	394640	Congrats on 10K. I really appreciate that. Are you familiar with the Forgotten Languages website
394640	399440	that has been active since 2007 and posting various articles every day? I actually got a link
399440	403920	from Forgotten Languages. We're going to talk about it a little later today in relation to UAPDA.
403920	407760	And yes, I do want to talk about that because I also have some good friends who kind of went
407760	412720	down that rabbit hole a while ago and probably have some more interesting stuff to say than I do.
412720	418800	But yes, it's very interesting. Anything on the Senator who blocked UAPDA?
419760	424560	2.0, Rand Paul. Everything I found was that no aerospace course donated to his campaign
424560	430160	and that he criticized the allocation of $22 million to ATIP. So instead of Rand Paul and Mike
430160	435520	Turner and these guys, we're going to talk about some of the lobbyists, the companies that lobbied
435520	439840	against the UAPDA. And I'm really excited to talk about that because those are really interesting.
440640	444000	Larry Reed worked for Lockheed. He has a book called Quantum Wave Mechanics, a dense physics
444000	448560	textbooks that covers anti-gravity and has UFO designs. Very interesting. That is very interesting.
448560	453520	I will have to check that out as well. The Hudson Valley Wave, interesting how many of
453520	458880	these sightings said the bottom of the crafts had what looked like... Yes, okay. So I've been
458880	466720	trying to talk to Ryan Wood about kind of early sightings of UFOs and possible ARVs. And the
466720	471840	Hudson Valley Wave may be an example of early days of ARV, alien reproduction vehicles with
471840	478080	kind of a lot of exterior opponents, triangles with seeming like a piping and not so circuitry,
478080	482880	but almost kind of signs of manufacturing on the bottom. I think if anything that indicates
482880	488080	maybe towards more a human-made origin, and I would really like to talk about that more.
490160	495200	Think about the James Webb talk. I have not really been... I've not been too dialed in. I know
496480	502160	the narrative going on right now, but to be honest, I have... I got crash retrievals
502160	507280	and whistleblowers to talk about right now. So we'll let that play out a little bit. I'll probably
507840	512720	kind of stay on the sidelines for that, but of course I will be updated. I have no opinion at the
512720	518240	moment. What is your opinion on the Voronezh UFO incident where UFO landed and beans came out
518240	523440	of the object? A lot of witnesses and KGB investigations. Was this one of the files that
523440	529520	George Knapp smuggled out of the Soviet Union? Remind me if that was the Voronezh incident,
529520	534080	please, because that's kind of on the tip of my tongue and I can't think right at the moment.
534320	539600	David, Carol Rosen was the first female head of an aerospace company, Fairchild,
539600	542880	and worked with Werner von Braun. She writes about UFOs and mentioned von Braun knew about
542880	546560	an engineered alien invasion. Okay, that's interesting because I know a lot of people talk
547120	551680	they like to relate Project Bluebeam or something along those lines with kind of the final words
551680	556320	and the gravestones of Werner von Braun and of course his mentor, Herman Osberth, participated
556320	561120	in very serious flight calculation speeds of UFOs back in the 40s. So that is interesting.
562000	567520	Local H.J., thank you so much for the two bucks. You make the best UAP content. Keep it up. I really
567520	572000	appreciate that, man. I absolutely will keep it up. Hopefully, there will become a time where
572000	577040	these videos are more so a historical record versus just investigating stories. That's what
577040	584720	I'm hoping for. Why Brazil has so many UAP sightings? They have no nuclear capability
584720	589280	or nuclear power plants for my knowledge. I've wondered this as well. There are a lot of
590240	595680	Brazilian fighter pilot, military pilot encounters with UFOs. And besides the Kalora's
595680	599440	Incident, I think this was in the 80s or 90s. There's a famous incident in Brazil. It's called
601120	606000	Night of Something. I got to find it. I'll post it in the Discord, but it's where multiple,
606640	610480	multiple, multiple people across multiple states in Brazil all observed very similar
610480	614640	things flying over Brazil. So this combined with the Kalora's Incident, with the Magé
614720	620240	Brazil, combined with Virginia. Brazil seems to have some of the most activity of UAP outside of
620240	625680	the U.S. And it is very interesting. That Kecksburg video was awesome. I appreciate that. That was
625680	632160	a heck of a lot of fun to make. I want to continue along the lines of investigation for Dr. Eric
632160	637760	Walker. I reached out to his children. I've heard nothing back. And I've also reached out to Joe
637760	642960	Califano. If you remember, I talked about him kind of in Johnson's meeting. So I've heard nothing
642960	647920	from him, but that'd be a person I really would like to speak to. All right, we'll get through
647920	652640	these guys. And then there are a couple things I want to speak about. And we'll do more Q&A. But
652640	659120	I think one thing in particular, everybody will find of great interest. Excited to hear that
659120	662240	you're familiar. I've been down that rabbit hole and I've compiled a lot of information from that
662240	666400	site. People love to dismiss it, but there's more going on there for sure. Yes, for anybody that
666400	671360	just joined, we're talking about the Forgotten Languages site that it was the anonymous briefing
671440	675760	for Congress for the UAP timeline that has a lot of links to the Forgotten Languages site and
675760	682000	references there. Very interesting. As Earth Ambassador to the Aliens, I would like to offer
682000	686880	up Rand Paul to you, Aliens for Abduction. You could do whatever you want with them. Yeah, Rand
686880	695200	Paul, this is a bit out of left field for him to be the primary blocker of the UAPDA. I was not
695200	701280	expecting such a thing. What's up, Zach? Gordon Novel of JFK and Watergate fame wrote a book on
701280	705840	reverse engineering. Kraft just learned about that recently. That is interesting. I've never
705840	713440	heard of that. I've got to check that out. If I'm not mistaken, the Hudson Valley UAPs were
713440	718000	responding in movement to witness thoughts. I've not heard that either. I need to check that out
718000	722320	as well. Okay, let's keep going through these guys. We'll get through these and then a couple
722320	726800	topics I can't wait to talk about. Everything there is available thus far with the James Webb
726800	735200	Telescope Drama. I can't remember what Senator said. He said no comment to expose a classified
735920	742400	briefing. There's plenty of other stuff, at least for me, my focus to talk about versus
742400	746400	James Webb. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of good articles, maybe from Matt Laszlo,
746400	750320	maybe from other content creators talking about this. I'll probably wait off for a little bit
750320	755280	just because there's so much dang stuff I really want to talk about. Yes, this Brazil incident is
755360	764080	called Night of the Flying Saucers. Radar says, another Norway incident in June of 1967. I'm not
764080	769600	even going to try to pronounce that man, but this is similar to the Spitzberg in 1952 case. Norway
769600	777840	also has a lot of very interesting sightings worth checking out. How do you explain to people the
777840	783040	reasoning behind the use of the nuanced term NHI or non-human intelligence? This is because this is
783040	788080	the term put into the congressional record, non-human intelligence, not alien, not ETs,
788080	792480	not ultra terrestrials, not crypto terrestrials, but non-human intelligence. This is why in his
792480	799520	interview with Ross Colthart and his appearance in the hearings last year in July of 2023,
799520	804560	David Grush made meticulous effort to always say he's talking about non-human intelligence,
804560	809280	never using the word alien, never using the word extraterrestrial. Then if you notice people
809280	814240	like Sean Kirkpatrick in their interviews will always talk about, say, alien or extraterrestrial.
814960	819680	They will hardly, if ever, use the term non-human intelligence. That is why the term
819680	827280	non-human intelligence is so important to use in context. What exactly is this alien virus?
827280	835840	Is this the reason they're so serious about silence? I'm not sure. Possible origins of an alien
835840	842000	virus may come from the 1974 Koyame Mexico crash retrieval in which a team of Mexican soldiers,
842000	846960	according to the denumber report, was killed by a biological contaminant leaking from the craft.
846960	856400	So I'm not sure. They do use JWST for photos of planets within our solar system. Yes,
856400	861040	they do. And they also use it for mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry, I don't know how to say that
861040	869760	in plural form or for exoplanets. Okay, let's see. They are tool poids from... Oh, more tool poids.
869760	874160	Cool. Well, as we talked about last week, or two weeks ago with Greer, he was talking about
874160	880160	various forms of UAP and kind of the significance of UAP and said that defense companies like
880160	884560	Lockheed Martin were creating almost thought forms. That was really, really interesting to me.
885280	890320	Kecksburg video was nice and congrats on 10k sub. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that very much.
890320	895840	Do I have any plans to visit some famous locations? I would love to, but I do have plans to go to the
895840	902240	November 13th hearings in Washington if I can. If I can swing that, I'm going to find a dang
902240	908480	camera guy, bring that guy, go to those. And then I've heard rumors of Seoul doing another conference
908480	912240	in late November of 2024. If that happens as well, I will also go to that.
913360	917600	Jimmy, I know you. I think you changed your name. Thank you so much for the $20.
917680	922320	I very much appreciate that very, very, very much. These people are always in the background
922320	926960	and John Lear in 1988 named a lot of interesting names of second generation MJ12 Bobby Ray Inman.
926960	935200	Yes, absolutely. Carl Sagan, Edward Teller and Hillencoder, Senator or Senior Bush, HW Bush.
935200	940720	Yes, especially Hillencoder. Hillencoder is of extreme interest to me. We talked about him at
940720	947360	length as the named briefing, briefing individual of the Eisenhower briefing document and who
947360	952960	also had some actually pretty outstanding comments on UFOs publicly. So very interesting person,
952960	957120	Hillencoder, but also Bobby Ray Inman. I can't remember where we covered him. I think I talked
957120	962720	about him in the, what was it? The Off World Technologies Division in relation to the Navy.
962720	969920	I think it was, but yes, very interesting. What do you think about the phenomenon? The more they
969920	973760	will manifest to you even in, I'm convinced the more you think about, yeah, that's like the call
973760	977280	of the void, right? The more you stare into the this, the more it stares back at you and that's
977280	980880	kind of a, the associated term with much, much kind of high strangeness.
983200	986800	Kai, the thing about the Hudson Valley and all these UFO waves like Belgium being manmade is
986800	991200	why do they fly like they are trying to be seen? It's almost like the ARVs are trying to replicate
991200	995440	NHI behavior. Yes, this is very weird to me. I have many personal friends who are adults just
995440	1000320	because I trained Jiu Jitsu and I mean, I'm an adult too, but they're older 40s and 50s who
1000320	1004080	talk about his kids, especially in the area of New York. I have one friend I trained Jiu Jitsu with
1004080	1009040	who saw a triangular shaped craft with three lights flying at a very low altitude. I'm talking
1009040	1013360	hundreds of feet over him. It often seems like these craft, especially triangular shaped craft,
1013360	1018080	are flying at a very low elevation, almost begging to be seen. It's very strange.
1020080	1024400	Looking at Thomas Bearden, I have heard Bearden's name before. I can't remember exactly where.
1025200	1029280	MZ, you're from Brazil and I can say there is a lot of UFO activity here and most of it is not
1029280	1033680	talked about outside of Brazil. The Claudio case is real. I'd love to hear more if you have some
1033680	1039120	cases that are underrepresented and underrepresented and under explored, especially crash retrieval
1039120	1045360	cases. Jango, thank you so much for the $10. You are generous with your money and I really,
1045360	1051280	really, really, really, really appreciate that. The Norway incident, the Norwegian military spent
1052240	1055600	several weeks diving after the object without finding anything. This reminds me of the Shag
1055600	1062160	Harbor in 64 case. Okay, someone or something. Here is Kirk Patrick dodging the ET versus
1062160	1067040	NHI question to a ridiculous degree. Yes, it's absurd. Kirk Patrick is the specific example.
1067760	1074000	And although he's more of a Twitter troll, guys like John or Stephen Greensreet saying,
1074000	1079600	oh, he's flying alien space monsters. That's another one that's a bit funny to me. Oh, sorry.
1080240	1083440	What is your take on David Grush and Lou Elizondo constantly saying maybe they're from
1083440	1086480	in between when referencing we don't know if they're alien or extraterrestrial?
1087120	1090880	Well, Grush has talked about, especially in outtakes of his interview with Ross Coldheart
1090880	1095440	for News Nation. He says he uses the term nonhuman intelligence, but also says that these are
1095440	1100880	presumably extraterrestrial. But then in the congressional record also discusses the holographic
1100880	1106960	universe principle and the possibility of sort of ultra dimensional beings, beings that don't
1106960	1111440	necessarily originate from our 3d space. My question is why cannot it possibly it's both
1111440	1115920	the this isn't a mutually exclusive thing to have extraterrestrial and sort of an ultra
1115920	1119280	terrestrial even a crypto terrestrial origin. There could be a combination of these.
1121200	1125360	Fan meetups and Roswell, that would be fun. Actually, I would love that. I'd love to go to
1125360	1130560	to the Roswell region. Maybe we'll do a fan meetup as as we grow. That would be very interesting.
1130560	1134640	Thank you for talking about the biological aspect of it. This, my friend, you cannot talk
1134640	1138160	about crash retrievals without discussing biologics. This is something I learned from early.
1138880	1142080	Always thought I could, especially because biologics are the most controversial part of
1142080	1145360	any crash retrieval story. I thought, you know, maybe I can stay a little bit away from this,
1145360	1151200	but no, absolutely not. I in fact, I love speaking about biologics. What's your opinion on JRot?
1151200	1155920	Any plans to cover this JRot? If anybody doesn't know, this is the extraterrestrial being allegedly
1155920	1161760	covered from the Kingman crash in 53. According to this story, there were two JRots captured live.
1161760	1169120	One EBE, it was called a, I can't remember. It was like EBE 53 AZ or something like that to denote
1169760	1174240	Arizona and the year and the extraterrestrial. One was sent to Los Alamos National Labs and
1174240	1180080	one was sent to S4, I believe it was. I think this is a very interesting story. And there's
1180080	1185680	also claims of JRot outside of just Dan Burish, of course, who's made the JRot story very famous.
1186400	1190640	And he talks about JRot being housed in a very secure facility. And I think the fifth floor
1190640	1195840	underground in S4, where he would take blood samples from this creature as it would be brought
1195840	1199920	into sort of like a containment dome, like if you've seen boy in the bubble, like that. But
1199920	1206400	there's also, who am I thinking about? I'm thinking about a, why can I, Bill Youhouse,
1206400	1212080	who has talked about JRot and the flying saucer simulator that was installed at S4 from the
1212080	1218480	Kingman crash. But JRot's very interesting. Yay. Your super chat got ignored, Chris.
1220560	1225600	Oh, I'm so sorry, man. Chris, thank you so much. I'm sorry, man. I try to answer everything. That's
1225600	1231520	totally my bad. Zable on need to know if you guys don't know Bryce Zable, he runs a co-podcast with
1232160	1237600	Ross Coltheart on YouTube called need to know. He said, Sagan knew a lot more about UFOs.
1237600	1242720	Lear and 88 called him out as the second generation of MJ12. He was in the hearings in 68 too.
1242720	1248800	Yes, absolutely. Even Ryan Wood has talked about Carl Sagan in regards to the majestic
1248800	1255200	documents quite a bit. I think multiple people now, Lear and Ryan Wood and maybe even Stanton
1255200	1261360	Friedman has commented on this, that Carl Sagan was secretly rather involved in UAP. But I'm sorry
1261360	1269200	for missing that, man. That's truly my bad. Truly my bad. Let's see. We talked about this a little
1269200	1273520	bit, TF, the James Webb telescope. There's definitely the congressman who talked about note,
1273520	1278160	said no comment in regards to a James Webb briefing, but I will probably wait to cover
1278160	1284720	that if covering it at all, just because I like to have a lot of time to sit down with my projects.
1285280	1287920	Now, a lot of developing stories are a little bit tough to cover.
1288880	1292480	Trollmama, thank you so much for the $20. I really appreciate that.
1294480	1300000	Be a BJJ and MMA beast. Hold down 10K YouTube channel. Thank you very much. I will try to
1300000	1305600	continue to be a beast. When they say they walk among us, do you think imagine them being undocumented
1305600	1310000	or fully integrated into the system and have families and kids? I don't know. That's actually a
1310000	1314160	good question. There's of course different conflicting schools of thought. Of course,
1314160	1319920	there's the valiant Thor story of the alleged extraterrestrial that I believe aided Eisenhower,
1319920	1329040	was it, who almost passed for an uncanny valley effect of person. Now, I still don't have an
1329040	1335920	informed opinion on if NHI is actively walking amongst humans. I have not done enough research
1335920	1340800	into that, but this is something I would like to look into more, but I know the story of valiant Thor.
1340880	1347600	There's also David Ike's theory of reptilians walking among us, which is very scary, but I do not know.
1349920	1356320	MrBeast had a UFO sighting recently. I've never seen a MrBeast video, but I heard his videos are
1356320	1362400	quite crazy. What do you make of the rumors of China's development of some kind of underwater
1362400	1366560	laser propulsion system? Could this be the technological surprise we've been warned about?
1366560	1369760	Possibly, because in just a few minutes, probably like 10 minutes, actually,
1369760	1372240	we're going to talk a little bit about underwater, but with the US.
1374560	1379040	I hope we have aliens here on earth like Rogers from American Dad. That would be hilarious.
1380880	1385600	If there's NHI working alongside human scientists, like some aero whistleblowers have
1385600	1390320	stated and so forth and many others, I would really, really, really like to see that.
1391200	1395680	What do you think about Gary McKinnon and Hack and his supposed secret space program?
1396160	1402240	If anybody doesn't know Gary McKinnon, I think this was in 2002. He hacked various military
1402240	1409600	systems and found files relating to non-terrestrial officers list of parent US officers that are
1409600	1414880	operating in ships throughout our solar system and possibly abroad called non-terrestrial officers.
1415440	1424480	He also posted an image of a craft, I believe it was, of a USS craft and it was cigar shaped,
1424480	1430560	but with almost portholes at the center, at the top and bottom, and some sort of variable
1430560	1439200	surface at each end of the cylinder. His story is one of the most, it's been around in Ufology
1439200	1442800	one of the longest Gary McKinnon story. Now, I think some of the controversy with him and
1442800	1447600	where people start to discredit him is he says he didn't either own a printer or didn't think to
1447600	1452480	grab a print of these files. However, I know Gary McKinnon is still around and I think he's
1452480	1457760	evaded legal prosecution at this point and I would like to speak to him. I'd like to speak to
1457760	1463840	him a lot, but the Gary McKinnon story is, that's kind of one of the OGs, the classics of Ufology
1463840	1469280	and I will probably reserve judgment until I can try and talk to him or if somebody has a
1469280	1474800	documentary featuring Gary McKinnon coming out, which would be interesting. Harry, thank you so
1474800	1479520	much for the five bucks. It doesn't matter how much you give, I just appreciate your support.
1479520	1485280	Thank you so much. I'm trying to get through all of these guys. I'm sorry for being slow.
1486160	1489920	The Alagash UFO incident is a good one to check out. I have not spent any time looking
1489920	1497200	into the Alagash UFO incident, so that is excellent. Feather hat talking about Sagan.
1497200	1500320	When I heard Sagan might be involved, I was like, no way. Also come on, Sagan,
1500320	1507600	you seem the opposite of MJ12. Yes, Sagan was also very outspoken against UAP. So was
1507600	1515360	Astronmer Donald Menzel. Oh, more Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast UFO retrieval stories always have
1516800	1522080	chrysalogics involved. It's Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast has talked about crash retrieval,
1522080	1528080	if that's the case. I don't know how that fits into his channel, but that is interesting and
1528080	1534400	I'd like to hear it. What is the full list of 12 alleged crashes that there's more than 12,
1534400	1539920	but there's a lot more than 12. I would recommend reading the book Magic Eyes Only by
1539920	1545680	Ryan S. Wood, which recounts almost 100 crash retrieval cases, but there's plenty more than
1545680	1551680	12, especially in the US. You got classic cases like Kecksburg, Roswell, Kingman. Why can I think
1551680	1559360	of the name? There's a name I can't think of right now. Kecksburg, Long Island, a case in West
1559360	1569360	Virginia, 1897, Aurora, Texas crash, the Cape Giradeau 1941 crash. There's a 2008 Needles,
1569360	1574480	California. You can think of two dozen cases and I'm thinking of Aztec as the 1948 cases. I
1574480	1578560	couldn't think of, but there's more than 10. There's dozens of cases you could read about.
1578560	1581360	There's the San Augustine Plains. There's just so many here in the States.
1582320	1585680	Let's not do the David Ike thing. Yeah, I'm probably going to stay away from talking about
1585680	1592480	David Ike. That's not my realm. They travel here in faster than light tech to walk among us
1592480	1596640	just to work a nine to five and pay taxes. I hope not. I hope the galactic standard isn't to work
1596640	1603120	in a nine to five because that would be very depressing. Walking among us might involve
1603120	1607280	hybrids from egg sperm extraction program involving abductions. There's been quite a bit
1607280	1612480	of talk about hybrids of late. Don't know what to make of it. Haven't done research. Correct me
1612480	1616960	if I'm wrong. I think a couple of scientists have made such mention lately, but I will be
1616960	1623200	doing my research. Any chance of a video on the MAJ Brazil UFO accident? Yes, absolutely. I would
1623200	1630400	recommend watching MacMave Studios video on MAJ Brazil. There's so much kind of video supporting
1630400	1637760	video of the case and some really rich stories. Yes, absolutely. I got two videos I'm going to do
1637760	1640960	before another crash retrieval and then we will see what crash retrieval we do then,
1640960	1645120	but I promise you will get there. What way do you speculate the phenomenon relates to?
1645760	1651040	Elizondo stated as the three-body problem. What aspect of that story is relevant to today? The
1651040	1655680	three-body problem talks about the dark forest theory of the Fermi paradox, which if you've
1655680	1659840	never heard of the dark forest theory, it's the concept that advanced extraterrestrial
1659840	1664720	and kind of universe-spanning civilizations do not broadcast their location in fear and
1664720	1668960	knowledge of other civilizations that will basically invade and take over and so forth.
1669040	1674240	I think with Lou, this could probably tie into the threat narrative he talks about often about
1674880	1680080	possible threat proposed by NHI. This could be in direct relation to something like the
1680080	1684640	three-body problem and the dark forest theory, so kind of the threat narrative.
1686640	1691200	Corona Clay, the one. Has there been any claims from the archaeological community of a potential
1691200	1696560	UFO found on a dig to match up with Bob Lazar's claims? Not to my knowledge. Not to my knowledge.
1699680	1703360	What do you know about the project Gary Nolan briefly talked about? Some kind of tracking system
1703360	1707120	in a military-type units that will try to recover the craft before Pentagon
1707760	1712000	program units get it? Okay, yeah, that's a good question. Gary Nolan was talking about basically
1712000	1719120	a private crash retrieval team. This isn't like a 2004 Lockheed team. This is a team to make up
1719120	1726480	modern day to try and beat USG or private retrieval teams to down UAP. I think that is a very
1726480	1731040	dangerous proposition, especially if you're not utilizing Tier 1 operators. How are you going
1731040	1735600	to get there before the US military and US and the program when these allegedly have things like
1735600	1741280	golden domes, according to Danny Sheehan, which can detect UAP while still cloaked? How are you
1741280	1745360	going to get there before these retrieval teams who, as we've heard stories of, will shoot on site
1745360	1749600	and not hesitate to kill people in that area? I do not think that's a great idea and I imagine
1749600	1756720	that would have an extremely low success rate. Do I have any significant updates of any of my
1756720	1763040	previous videos? Yes, and those will make it into future videos. Always updates. There's never a
1763040	1768240	video I do where I stop investigating then, so especially we're going to talk a little bit about
1768240	1775680	an update to one of my recent videos, the Off-World Technologies Division here briefly. Any opinions
1775680	1783040	on Michael Masters currently reading the extra-testrial model? I have never heard of this model,
1783040	1790800	but I do know Michael Masters, but I will check that out, my friend. George Nicolakis.
1790800	1794400	A hundred crash retrieval. Okay, now I'm sure they have the complete Star Trek pack,
1794400	1798480	mind-blowing. Yes, of course, many of these stories are nothing more than stories with
1798480	1804560	a little more than just newspaper clippings, anecdotal evidence, hearsay, second, third-hand
1804560	1809040	encounters, but there are quite a few retrievals and I'd say well over a dozen that have very
1809040	1813680	viable paper trails to pursue. A lot of these I have covered before and will continue to cover.
1813680	1819120	A lot of them need a lot more research done, but yes, there are numerous cases and this really
1819120	1825200	is excluding places like China and Russia, the former Soviet Union. So to access those files
1825200	1828960	and the alleged case or crash retrievals that have occurred there, that is something I want to do.
1829120	1837200	Okay, sorry, trying to get through these guys because then we'll get to the UAPDA. I'm sorry,
1837200	1842480	I will try to answer everything. Do you watch Angry Astronaut? Interesting UFO footage. No,
1842480	1846000	I need to check that out. I mentioned a couple of times, guys. It's a little tough to keep up
1846000	1850480	with footage just because there's so much footage and you can really debate endlessly and go down
1850480	1854080	rabbit holes of footage. So no, I have not, but I will make some time to do so.
1854640	1860160	Soon you're going to have to shut questions off and riff. Yes, we'll get through these and then
1861200	1866880	we will because I got like a, I think like 15 tabs up on Chrome I want to go through.
1867680	1874720	Ecology brings up some cases. View these, all great cases. 1989 Kalahari, that's what we're
1874720	1879360	going to talk about soon. That is a bit of a controversial case as well as the South Africa
1879360	1886560	1996 case that was mentioned by Stringfield. Good cases. Scallions, thank you so much. I really
1886560	1892320	appreciate your support. Thank you very much. Lou Elizondo keep constantly saying that's like
1892320	1896640	finding a 747 in King Tut's tomb has me wondering if he's hinting at finding something in Egypt
1896640	1903200	quite possibly. And I like the analogy of handing the nuclear device to people in Victorian era
1903200	1907360	as well in terms of the strangeness of this technology. Don't you think it's interesting
1907360	1911680	how figures like Elizondo and Grush have acknowledged we've made crash UAPs and are reverse
1911680	1916640	engineering them but won't say how much progress we've made? Yes, absolutely. And as far as I
1916640	1920960	know, I don't think Grush specifically is touched on the concept of ARV or successful reverse
1920960	1926800	engineering at all. The extent that I've heard is of course from public sources is that little
1926800	1931680	progress has been made in some instances, but this could be isolated to various defense contractors
1931760	1937360	or programs. I think it's not too far out of the question to say that this program similar to the
1937360	1942000	Manhattan Project is highly compartmentalized. There's probably various aspects of the program.
1942640	1948080	Various defense contractors are probably not sharing their data between themselves. So yes,
1949440	1954640	sorry, enjoying the cold brew here. Cold brew. Sorry guys, I can't speak today.
1955600	1960640	Speaking of Menzel, Colthart has recently interviewed physicist Beatrice Vareal,
1961520	1966320	Ville Vareal of the top 100 in the world who alleges Menzel destroyed some of the astronomical
1966320	1971200	plates at Harvard. Yes, this is true. This is called the Menzel Gap. And there's another
1971200	1975760	astronomer who has talked about this. This is called the Menzel Gap where much photos of
1975760	1982960	kind of earth skies were basically destroyed by Menzel. Menzel Gap. Very, very cool. Yes,
1982960	1988960	including the Washington flap that was 1952, specifically UFOs over Washington DC, which
1988960	1994080	led to a CIA sponsored press conference by General John A. Sanford and Roger Raimi to dispel interest
1994080	1999280	in UFOs. Virginia is the most famous crash retrieval case. It has details that James Fox
1999280	2003040	didn't cover in the film, such as the death of animals in the zoo where the NHI was cited.
2003040	2007280	I've heard that as well. Of course, James Fox probably couldn't get to everything, but he did
2007280	2013120	a tremendous job with Moment of Contact. What do I think about Patrick Jackson's theory? Gary
2013120	2019360	Nolan just talked about it. If anybody doesn't know Patrick Jackson, he focuses on spheres, orbs of
2019360	2024960	UAP. The crux of his argument is that spheres generally travel in groups of three almost in a
2024960	2032080	triangular shape where I don't know the full basis of a theory, but basically the three spheres work
2032080	2038160	in conjunction to navigate and participate in the space around it. I think Patrick Jackson
2038160	2043680	has a lot of images to back up his theories. I've never sat down and really dove through
2043680	2049600	everything, but of course, I think I've referenced some of the images and orb photos he's used before
2049600	2055440	because they're so dang interesting. There are claims, yes, Kabul, Afghanistan. I think this is
2056160	2061760	86. There's a Moondust file on this as well, but there's also stories of, I can't remember
2061760	2066720	where I've heard it, but of an Afghan embassy, or maybe this was an Iraqi embassy being built near
2066720	2075840	a UFO, or over a recovered UAP. Dead Fish Cheese Brez said, I saw a UFO 100 feet over me on January
2075840	2082800	10th, 23. I filed a MUFON report, number 127890. It was shot down over Alaska on February 9th,
2082880	2089440	23. Pentagon. Oh, did you witness the Alaska shootdowns or the craft that led to this? I'd love
2089440	2094960	to hear more about this, man. If you could give me some information on what altitude the craft
2094960	2101120	was flying at shape, see if any of the five UAP observables made sense to you, no visible signs
2101120	2108160	of propulsion, and so forth. I'd love to hear about it. Stories about Mercury, yeah. I think this
2108160	2114400	involved early stages of electrogravity, like rotating plates that contain Mercury. I think
2114400	2122080	I'm trying to use my head right now. Was anti-gravity research shut down? Was physics misled? I don't
2122080	2126880	think it was shut down. I'm going to be talking to Ryan Wood and Michael Schrat, if I can swing it.
2126880	2133120	I know you'll like this, Kai. Ryan Wood thinks the concepts behind anti-gravity were really
2133120	2139920	mastered in the 50s, and this is when ARV and reverse engineered craft were really put into
2139920	2144640	practice. Michael Schrat thinks the 60s was this time that anti-gravity was mastered, and reverse
2144640	2148080	engineering vehicles were put into practice. I'm going to have both of them on. We're going to
2148080	2152240	talk about these topics, and that is going to be a heck of a lot of fun, and I cannot wait.
2153200	2157600	Michael, you are awesome, brother. Thank you very much. Some of the radar data on the Washington
2157600	2163040	Flaps still managed to survive. Yes, it did. Christian, thank you. I'm sorry, brother. Thank
2163040	2168640	you very much. Any idea what this darker reality, Lou Elizondo, keeps hinting to what could possibly
2168640	2176240	be so bad? Well, of course, there's the threat theories of invasion or the sober reality behind
2177040	2181680	abduction and experimentation, if those are real. But these could be the darker reality.
2181760	2188560	Lou and a lot of the TTSA crew really push the threat narrative a lot more than I'd say
2188560	2193360	people like Grush do, and that is something I try to pay keen attention to.
2195280	2200480	Have I seen any of the weird MH370 videos? Yes, I think most lives, there's a couple
2200480	2207280	of questions about this. I'm staying clear of MH370 for now. I know that is a dang toxic sphere of
2207280	2212880	research, and I got plenty, plenty to look at outside of that. Regicide and non. Hey,
2213440	2219840	say less. I know regicide and non. I absolutely will. Keep doing what you do. Peyton Duke, thank
2219840	2226080	you so much for the $10. I really appreciate it. Optv, we still believe despite no UAPDA. Yes,
2226080	2233520	guys. Seriously, one minute, we'll talk about the UAPDA because I also am not crazy discouraged from
2233520	2237840	the shootdown of it. Christian, thank you for the $2. I really appreciate that as well. Thank you
2237840	2243280	so much. Kai, do you see footage of an ARV being tested over Groom Lake that was posted on the
2243280	2246240	Discord? They took a picture of the craft and it kind of looked like a flux liner. Yes.
2247520	2255120	There are, who posted in the Discord the TR3B folder as well? I need to look at that for some
2255120	2260480	other alleged ARV vehicle constructions and videos, but yes, I have seen that Groom Lake video.
2261200	2266160	What are your thoughts on the Reddit EBE posts? Is this the EBE that was associated with a Battelle
2266160	2274960	Lab and where the molecular biologist really goes into detail of the anatomy of EBEs? I would like
2274960	2279920	to talk about that, but I'm going to need a biologist on there for something. I'm well out of
2279920	2283520	my depth and I might be able to read the summary and say, hey, this sounds great, but I really cannot
2283520	2289120	offer any insights besides just saying this sounds interesting. So, dead fish, these were
2289760	2294720	shot down over Alaska, Yukon and Lake Huron. Not a balloon. I saw one. What was the shape of these
2294720	2301600	objects? I'm really interested to hear you say that. I got evidence of a clip I can send you of Jim
2301600	2306000	Semavan saying NASA can't tell us the truth even if they wanted to because of a SAP and executive
2306000	2311360	order. The clip isn't public. Unfortunately, it's Semavan. Please send that to me, uapgroom.gmail.com.
2311360	2318160	I would love to watch that. Ross Goldhart had a Swedish astronomer who's also part of the
2318160	2324560	Sol Foundation. She found potential evidence. Yes, I can't remember her name, but a trusted
2324560	2328400	person who runs another YouTube channel, another content creator, passed along her information
2328400	2334560	to me the other day. So, I'm actually going to talk to her. Edgar Fausch and Mark McCandlish.
2334560	2340800	Yes, okay. Kai, I know you like Mark McCandlish and there will be a video on him probably in
2340800	2346320	the very near future. I'm covering this because I have a little bit more to add to the story now
2346320	2352480	of Mark. I've talked to a couple people about it, but we'll just say that the
2352480	2356480	Mark McCandlish story got a little bit more interesting for myself in particular.
2357520	2365440	Menzel Gap, first UFO debunker, yes. First UFO debunker, maybe because that happened in 52
2365440	2370640	and right before the realm of the Robertson panel and so forth, but probably. Was physics led
2370640	2374480	down the false rabbit hole of string theory? I do not know. I know the debate over string
2374480	2378960	theory, M theory and so forth, super string theory, but I'm not a physicist and physics was
2378960	2384400	always my weak area. So, if I speak on string theory, I will probably sound like an idiot.
2385040	2388640	Adam, thank you so much. I really appreciate your kind words, brother. Thank you.
2389200	2393280	Yeah, okay. Dead fish. Tell us, brother. So, dead fish, if you've just joined, is talking about
2393280	2398000	observing in 2023 in January. The objects that were allegedly shot down over Alaska
2398640	2402160	and Lake Huron and so forth. I'm making a video about it, long story, but I saw it go from
2402160	2407040	horizon to horizon directly over me a hundred feet up. It was going about 150 miles per hour,
2407040	2411600	silent. It was a bright orange burning quartz crystal. Dead fish, if you make a video on this,
2411600	2416560	please let us let this crew know. We will, I will point the community towards your video.
2416560	2420400	We will support the heck out of it because that sounds fantastic and I cannot wait to
2420400	2428000	see your research and thesis here. So, that anti-grab is his hus, is hus hus and to keep
2428000	2434080	the mainstream from catching up. This is, this is, this is likely. There is also a really interesting
2434080	2439520	realm of research around anti-gravity spawning out of Alabama. I know Ross Colthart, as well as
2439520	2444480	Eric Weinstein has touched on this as well, but this sounds likely, yes. And especially in the
2444480	2449680	50s, there was so much work being done into anti-gravity research. Check out Jesse Michael's
2449680	2453520	work, his video about tea towns and brown, as well as his recent project with a Nick Cook.
2453600	2460800	They're fantastic. Dead fish, nobody, listen, nobody's doubting, doubting your credibility here. I
2460800	2464880	think every single person in this chat is super interested to hear about your story. Super
2464880	2470720	interested. Shout out to whoever mentioned Maje Brazil. Yes, absolutely. Crackerjack,
2470720	2473840	thank you so much for the five dollars. I really appreciate that. You finished your
2473840	2477840	masters in engineering. What realm? That congratulations. I don't know if I'm smart
2477840	2482240	enough to get a master, so that truly means you are a smart cookie. That is awesome.
2483680	2487280	If I had to take down an NHI brute, are we talking like a brute from Halo?
2488000	2493040	The best mixed martial art move that would work for all types. Get a Tomahawk elbow in there,
2493040	2498800	man. Get a Tomahawk elbow in there. I have a video and seven statements from other people.
2498800	2503520	Okay, so yeah, dead fish, if you're creating a documentary on this, please let me know and I
2503520	2508080	would love to have you on a live. Once you post this, we can talk about your video because that
2508080	2515360	sounds absolutely phenomenal. I cannot wait. You also said you saw a bright orange upside down
2515360	2521600	burning quartz crystal. Another person said it was a giant translucent craft. Now, this is very
2521600	2527440	interesting. What do you think about how certain UAP encounters and hotspots in particular seem to
2527440	2531600	be connected to other strange phenomenon like Bigfoot and Poltergeist? Jacques Filet has talked
2531600	2537040	about this. Yeah, like the more high strangeness of UAP, hitchhiker effect and so forth. There's
2537040	2541040	a podcast I love. It's a couple of Australian guys. It's called Mysterious Universe, if you guys
2541040	2545360	have ever talked about this, and they talk about high strangeness involved with UFOs, especially
2545360	2553200	in regards to skinwalker ranch. So I talk about this all the time, stuff like psionics is I'm
2553200	2558000	really trying to get comfortable with this and UAP and high strangeness is even more uncomfortable
2558000	2562720	for me. So I got to move really slow when it comes to like UAP, the hitchhiker effect, Lou
2562720	2566640	talking about green orbs and other strange stuff, some of the skinwalker ranch stuff because
2566720	2573440	I'm just so out of my dang element. So out of my element. See, fish, you got some you got some
2573440	2579600	support in here, man. You got some support. Okay, guys, let me answer this last. Hold on,
2579600	2583600	let's see this. Do you know Chris Mellon was highly involved in the Stargate program in 95 once it
2583600	2588080	got moved to the Senate? Seems like people think he just recently got I had no idea he was involved
2588080	2592640	in Stargate. Do you have any documents or something touching on this because I would very much like
2592640	2599600	to see that. History buff. If you went to med school, yeah, let's either hop in the discord
2599600	2603760	or shoot me an email at uapgurvegmail.com because I would love to kind of get your thoughts on that.
2605280	2609680	Okay, we will go through these guys. Lou has alluded to religion and spirituality many times.
2609680	2613680	Yes, he has. If there is a classified document on religion just to see how he reacts, I'm not
2613680	2618800	allowed to talk about that. If I do get to talk to Lou, which I've I've hoped I've been able to,
2618800	2624720	but I haven't got a chance to yet. Absolutely. Fat rodents. Thank you so much for the $10. I
2624720	2631120	really appreciate that. Really appreciate that. How about the JFK and UAP connection JFK MJ12?
2631120	2635600	I'd say it's the big ticket item. There is a I think one of the really interesting things to me
2635600	2642080	is that Reuben Efron, the case manager assigned to intercept Lee Harvey Oswald's mail in I think
2642080	2648800	1955 or a little bit after also had registered UAP sightings while on train with other officials
2648800	2652640	throughout the Soviet Union. There's just a lot of really interesting connections with JFK
2652640	2658400	and UAP, especially MJ12. Given the Virginia incident, I don't think I'm getting close.
2658400	2661920	I don't think getting close will work. Yes. If you if anybody's not familiar with the
2661920	2666560	Virginia incident, according to the story one, I think it was a local police officer actually
2666560	2671760	physically touched the the bean that came from the craft. This bean was super slick, super slimy,
2671760	2676400	wreaked of ammonia and actually died of a very mysterious death very soon after.
2677840	2682880	The mysterious universe is awesome. Yes, it is. Aaron Wright, Benjamin Grundy are two hilarious
2682880	2690320	Aussies. Okay, guys, we are let's move on to talking about the UAP DA favorite all time UAP case.
2690320	2697520	Uh, geez, I don't know if I have a favorite case. Probably my favorite crash retrieval is
2697520	2703840	Kecksburg. I love that story, but I also love Kingman as well. And I also there's just I don't
2703840	2707840	know if I have a favorite man. There's there's too many. There's too many. But okay, guys,
2707840	2714800	let me pull up. I'm going to share my screen in a second here. And we will get on to some of this
2714800	2719680	stuff. Let me figure out how to present, present share screen.
2722480	2724080	Okay, entire screen.
2727840	2734320	Okay, so as everybody knows, if you have been, oh, let me let me answer this from Kyle, a super chat
2734320	2740000	man, 20 bucks. That's incredible. Thank you so much. Have I looked into the Tianjin airport
2740080	2745120	sighting in China? No coverage on this very briefly, very briefly, but I would like to
2745120	2749040	look a little bit more about how UAP sightings over the airport kind of shut down airport
2749040	2755680	operations. We'll look into that more. So as we know, first posted, I'm shown a post by Matt
2755680	2760800	from the Good Trouble show, the UAP DA to be included in the National Defense Authorization
2760800	2767840	Act of 2025 was shot down. This was done by primarily Senator Rand Paul and so forth and
2767840	2773520	only three parts of the actual UAP DA made it into the actual, I think this was not for the
2773520	2779360	National Defense Authorization Act this year for 2025, but the Intelligence Defense Authorization
2779360	2785360	Act or something similar. Because here we can see these three aspects of the bill that actually made
2785360	2790960	it into the, we'll check in a second, I can't remember if it's the defense or intelligence.
2791520	2798160	But we have Comptroller General of the United States review of all domain anomaly resolution
2798160	2803520	office. We have sunset of requirements relating to audits of unidentified anomalous phenomena,
2803520	2809760	historical record reports, sunset is just kind of like the closing of and section 1003 funding
2809760	2814640	limitations relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena. I think in this post as well as others
2814640	2819840	people are talking about how this might be the one positive thing to come from this, the funding
2819920	2825040	limitations, but we need to remember that program activities, reverse engineering,
2825040	2830240	crash retrieval, these are are likely kept deep hidden deep within USAPs to the point the they
2830240	2835840	can avoid audit purposes and audit findings and reshift reshift under SAPOC if needed. So I don't
2835840	2840240	think funding limitations as seen with Congressional oversight will have any effect on program
2840240	2847600	activities. So these are the three parts that made it through okay into the Intelligence
2847600	2852800	Authorization Act for 2025. So if you guys have heard of the site open secret, you can actually
2852800	2862160	find lobbyists and so forth for bills and for various pieces of legislation. So as we saw with
2862160	2869040	the three pieces of UAP materials that made it into the S.4443, I'll just call it 43 from now on,
2869680	2876560	there was one company, a defense contractor in particular that specifically filed issue reports
2877440	2883200	with this with Title X. Can anybody guess what that is? That is, you're probably going to be
2883200	2887280	right if you guess, but you can also see the tab. So that's going to, I might as well just go into it.
2888000	2893360	Battelle, now if you've followed my channel before, you know we've talked about Battelle,
2893360	2898240	we've talked about the possibilities, possible study of meta materials under Battelle dating
2898240	2907680	back to the 1940s. Here with Title X, we see that Battelle itself had issues relating to
2907680	2915440	microelectronics and device cyber protection. That microelectronics statement is extremely,
2917040	2923440	is a big standout to me, but also we can look for other lobbying with it filing issue reports and
2923440	2930240	objections to the Intelligence Authorization Act. We see BAE systems. If you've known you,
2930240	2936080	BAE systems, this was the contractor that if, so if you know some of the lore from the channel
2936080	2941760	and stuff I've covered, you will remember BAE systems from the story of a three star general who
2941760	2949440	allegedly showed classified reverse engineer technology to a BAE systems employee in 2003
2949440	2955120	or 2004. Battelle Memorial Institute, Lado Sink, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman,
2956400	2962400	University of California Princeton. So some universities as well, but these are some of the
2962400	2967360	usual suspects we'd expect to see, especially about legislation that may have effect on private
2967360	2974320	industry and UAP. Now, if anybody knows Christopher Sharp, which I'm sure many of you do of the
2974320	2982080	Liberation Times, he wrote an excellent piece on this. This came out September 20th, 2024. So
2982080	2988640	just the other day, if anybody read this article, there might be something that stands out too
2988640	2992960	about this, but I'm going to read it. Okay, I'll read it word for word, maybe not word for word,
2992960	2997600	but we'll go kind of quick. So actually, I'm not going to read it word for word, because that'll
2997600	3003760	take too long. But in this article, Chris Sharp talks about the UAPDA being shut down. This was
3003760	3008320	introduced by Senators Mike Rounds, the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. I'm sure most of
3008320	3012880	you have heard of this legislation will know it as the Schumer Amendment, including the 2024
3012880	3019680	and the 2025 UAPDA for the NDAA and Intelligence Authorization Act, and so forth. I would really
3019680	3027200	recommend reading this article, but things get a little interesting here. Chris Sharp states,
3027600	3034240	we'll actually go up a little bit. So if passed, the UAPDA could have unleashed a process revealing
3034240	3039120	that the US government and defense contractors possess retrieved craft, which are according to
3039120	3045280	the act capable of transmedium travel, instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic speeds, and positive
3045280	3050160	lift. List of the five observable or list of some of the observables of UAP craft is outlined by Lou
3050160	3056640	Elizondo, five now six famously, if you include cognitive effects. Liberation Times has learned
3056640	3061600	that the CIA currently facing mounting criticism over alleged dishonesty regarding anomalous
3061600	3066320	health incidents Havana syndrome, if anybody doesn't know, along with the Department of Defense
3066320	3071200	and Department of Energy has consistently bypassed democratic oversight and retrieving advanced
3071200	3076560	objects of unknown origins. According to Liberation Times, these materials are subsequently sent to
3076560	3082720	national labs and select defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin. So all stuff that's
3082720	3089360	really great to see in writing, right? But nothing new here. Of course, the CIA, this is in reference
3089360	3095520	to the OGA, Chris Sharp is the person that wrote the Daily Mail article about the OGA and JSOC
3095520	3103040	recovery teams. Reading on, we read a little bit more about the UAPDA, but this article came out
3103040	3109680	in I want to focus specifically right here guys, specifically right here. This article came out
3109680	3117280	September 20. It is now September 22. Holy crap. Two cents. That is insane. Thank you so much.
3117840	3123280	That is unbelievable. And I will eat so much to pull. Thank you so much for this. I really
3123280	3129760	appreciate that. Thank you. And Teddy, I'm also from Cincinnati. So thank you, man. Greetings to you.
3130480	3134480	But thank you again, two cents. So this article was put out September 20.
3135440	3139440	It's September 22. There has been a massive revision to this article,
3139440	3144320	a massive revision, because I've read through this today, preparing for this live. And there was a
3144320	3151360	specific mention of a specific organization that wasn't present in this article. And I was flabbergasted
3151360	3156000	because reading through this when it came out, you know, I saved the file just because I was
3156000	3160160	worried something like this would happen and so forth. So but thankfully, other people have
3160160	3165440	talked about this on or have saved this link on the web archive from its original posting, guys.
3166640	3175280	So let's go to let's go to the original post here, guys. And let's reread. This is the original
3175280	3179280	article that came out on the 20th by Chris Sharp. All of this is public information. I'm not revealing
3179280	3185120	anything on previously unknown. Multiple programs are understood to be orchestrated by the CIA's
3185280	3188640	Directorate of Science and Technology and its Directorate of Operations,
3189200	3194800	including its maritime branch alongside components of the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office,
3195360	3202480	US Navy, National Reconnaissance Office, Space Command, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency,
3202480	3207840	and Joint Special Operations. According to Liberation Times, missions carried out by these
3207840	3213600	programs include the retrieval of objects beneath the oceans, including the CIA's Directorate of
3213600	3219280	Operations, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office coordinated between the CIA and US Navy,
3219280	3226000	United States Special Special Operations Command, and submersibles from the Woods Hole Oceanic
3226000	3232160	Institute Oceanographic Institution. Now this seems like an insane redaction from the original
3232160	3237520	article, doesn't it? The original article mentioned CIA doesn't mention CIA's Directorate of Science
3237520	3243360	and Technology. It doesn't mention the NRO and OGA. I mean, sorry, the NRO and NGA, the two offices
3243360	3249280	David Grush worked for and was as liaison to the UAP Task Force, and it sure as heck doesn't mention
3249280	3255120	the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office or the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
3255120	3259680	If you guys have watched my lives before, remember, I shouted out one of my buddies, Max Parr, who
3259680	3269600	donated it to the channel and asked if I had done much research into the National Underwater Reconnaissance
3269600	3276560	Office. A little bit behind the scenes I had, but I was shocked to see this posted by Chris Sharp.
3276560	3283920	Now look at the end there, guys. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Now there is a very
3283920	3289840	tasty treat of research we can go down here. So one, I can't remember the gentleman who was talking
3289840	3296160	about forgotten languages. Forgotten languages has its own post about NRO, the National Underwater
3296160	3300880	Reconnaissance Office. This, for anybody who doesn't know, Forgotten languages is like a
3300880	3307920	really strange encrypted website that has really spoken about a lot of UAP stuff, whether it's
3307920	3312640	a LARP, whether it's not, but this was mentioned a lot in the UAP timeline, a collection of links
3312640	3318160	and so forth that was sent to Congress before the 2023 hearings. This is what that article looks like
3318160	3322480	if nobody's read it. It's a fantastic piece. I reference this with all of my cases,
3323440	3330320	but Forgotten languages is an anonymous site in the public domain and it's like an encrypted site,
3330320	3334720	but that's not what I want to talk about. The National Underwater Reconnaissance Office
3336880	3342560	is developed for the U.S. Air Force in CIA to manage satellite reconnaissance and it's often
3342560	3347920	known as the hidden brother of the actual NRO. But let's talk about the Woods Hole, or I'll just
3348080	3355280	call it Woods Hole from now on. So Woods Hole, its mission statement is Woods Hole is dedicated
3355280	3359360	to advancing knowledge of the ocean and its connection with the earth system through a sustained
3359360	3365440	commitment to excellence in science, engineering, and education. Pretty standard, right? Who we are,
3365440	3370240	what we do, vision and mission statements, they probably have some federal grants and so forth.
3371920	3376000	My computer keeps giving me notifications. Let me turn off my secondary speaker. Sorry,
3376000	3382880	guys. If you can still hear me. Yeah, okay. So I had no idea NRO even existed. Most people do not.
3382880	3388880	It's not very well publicized and we will probably see why after here. So if you guys remember my
3388880	3394800	Offworld Technologies Division video, the certain location that was spoken about much work was
3394800	3402240	done with that and it's a fellow contractor, SAIC, Science Applications Center National Corporation,
3402240	3407680	by analyzing contracts and grants to the contractor. So
3409920	3416480	WHO Woods Hole has received quite a bit in federal grants and federal awards since its inception.
3417440	3424080	Since 2001, there has been a total of $3.3 billion awarded. Many of these,
3424080	3430960	IDIQ indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, IDV indefinite delivery vehicles, IDC indefinite
3430960	3436480	delivery contract and so forth. But there are a few of massive interest here to me at least.
3438400	3443040	This contract in particular between Woods Hole and the Office of Naval Research for O&I.
3444240	3450080	This was for communications, navigation and unmanned vehicles for Arctic operations. Now,
3450080	3454960	if you haven't heard of O&R, I've talked about it a few times. Many ufologists and researchers have
3454960	3460400	talked about it a few times. I think I talked about O&R specifically in relation to a paper it wrote
3460400	3467440	on psionic research in 2008 to 2012 and the validity of psionic research. So this is just one
3467440	3477120	contract that Woods Hole has with Navy. There's also contracts, one of its largest contract vehicles,
3477120	3487120	for $794 million over the span of nine years was with the Naval Undersea Warfare Center.
3487760	3491280	Now, if you guys have watched the Off-World Technologies Division, I talked about a sister
3491280	3497680	facility, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, the sister facility here to this location in Newport,
3497680	3502640	Rhode Island. This project was to procure hardware, materials, and supplies as well as
3502640	3507840	services to develop, build, fabricate, integrate, evaluate, and support the unmanned undersea
3507840	3513680	vehicle, UUV, for family of systems. So remember what Chris Sharp wrote about here,
3513760	3519760	that the Woods Hole, in particular, along with Nuro, is used to retrieve underwater crash
3519760	3524080	retrievals. And actually, just so we can see, over in the DPI archives, there's a great...
3525120	3528320	I'm going to put this graphic up when we talk about underwater retrievals.
3529360	3536320	It's a great graphic. Just from Greer, I have no idea in what relation this case is to. I've
3536320	3540800	tried to figure it out. You know how Greer's files work if you've ever been on the DPI archive,
3540800	3548000	but just a nice thing to look at here. So we can go further. So the National Undersea Warfare
3548000	3552400	Center, just like I said, the sister facility to the Surface Warfare Center. This is in Rhode
3552400	3556480	Island, not too far from the location I spoke about. But we can look at other contracts with
3557360	3567120	Woods Hole. Here is a contract with NSWC Crane. And you know what contractor it's with? SAIC.
3568080	3575120	I had zero idea this existed or that Woods Hole had contracts with SAIC. SAIC, if you've never
3575120	3579360	seen the video in the Off-World Technologies Division, I studied it. I went through the testimony
3579360	3584800	of a whistleblower in an interview that stated that Off-World Technologies was being studied here,
3584800	3587920	were being studied here in a division called the Off-World Technologies Division,
3587920	3594800	with a present contractor after much abundant research. Myself and my friend Kermit had determined
3594880	3600240	that this was SAIC, Science Applications and International Corporation. This specific project,
3600240	3604880	it seems like a very small amount of money. What was for research and development of
3604880	3610720	expeditionary weapon systems for Naval Sea Systems Command, NAVSEA, Naval Surface Warfare Center,
3610720	3617040	Crane Weapon Systems Division, JXN, and program executive office unmanned and small combatants.
3617680	3622080	Now, remember what we talked about in the Off-World Technologies Division, why the specific
3622640	3627840	I spoke about was there to test experimental conventional weaponry, where he was taken to
3627840	3632160	the Off-World Technologies Division, where one piece of technology was guessed to be a weapon
3632160	3637840	due to an electric discharge during recovery. I find it very interesting of the mention of
3637840	3642800	expeditionary weapon systems here, but this goes even further, guys. There's more contracts here
3642800	3649600	with tons of contracts with NSWC Crane, with the Navy, with the Air Force, and so forth. But
3649600	3654160	let's look at this specific contract for engineering services, National Defense R&D Services,
3654160	3662480	Department of Defense Military, Experimental Development. I found this piece, the most
3662480	3667920	interesting or fishy here. This IDC indefinite delivery contract was awarded sole source to
3667920	3672720	Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute because the government believes that the supplier has unique
3672720	3680160	capabilities that cannot be otherwise obtained. Now, what I mentioned there, the Woods Hole is
3681280	3686480	the only kind of non-profit organization because Woods Hole is a non-profit, federally funded
3686480	3694240	institution that has any sort of submersible or these kind of R&D capabilities. I wanted to
3694240	3698880	introduce you guys to this statement by Chris Sharpe that was edited out of this article,
3698880	3703600	as well as Woods Hole, because I am doing a massive research project on this. It's not
3703600	3707920	next video, but I'm doing so much research on this and the National Underwater Reconnaissance
3707920	3715040	Office. This mention by Chris Sharpe was shocking to me of a specific mention in this specific
3715040	3722320	non-profit for undersea crash retrieval operations. And then to see that this company, this non-profit,
3722320	3730000	has ties with NSWC Crane, with the Underwater Weapon Center, and so forth, was really shocking to
3730000	3734400	me. So I wanted to talk about that a little bit. There's going to be a lot more research done there.
3735680	3740240	But if you guys found that interesting, that Chris Sharpe article in the mention of the UAPDA,
3741760	3748400	I have not seen anybody talking about that particular omission from his,
3748880	3753200	from his, nobody connects the dots better. People do do it better. If you guys see on
3753200	3757200	lives, I struggle very much to speak. I trip over my tongue because I'm trying to think of so much
3757200	3765200	stuff so fast. But so this is going to be a kind of a main line of research for myself. And if I
3765200	3770720	can find any similar witnesses, whistleblowers to talk about this, you guys know I will. So I hope
3770720	3777760	everybody found that interesting. Next, I wanted to talk a little bit about, and if for anybody who's
3777760	3782800	kind of in the discord or something, I'll post all of this stuff. I'll put an invite here if you
3782800	3790000	guys want, but I usually put all my research files in there. So just a good place to talk if you
3790000	3795840	want to review the research files. So next, there was a pretty interesting Reddit post yesterday
3795840	3799840	I kind of want to talk about now, that I'm sure a lot of you guys saw this. It actually blew up a
3799840	3808160	little more than I thought. Sorry, guys. And it says, Hello, everyone. I made my dad a promise
3808160	3813680	when he passed away last week. He worked for the Pentagon from the 60s to 80s. Now, if you guys
3813680	3821680	don't know, this is another long, so before I get to that, yeah, huge loss with the UAPDA, but
3821680	3826480	still have hope, my friend. I'm of the mind where I think that our best result is going to be with
3826480	3830880	a little bit more catastrophic disclosure. I do not think we're going to get much,
3831680	3836240	even if the UAPDA passes. Remember, there's an executive order program that was created under
3836240	3841360	Obama that automatically factors things of nonhuman intelligence. This could also be AI
3843040	3849520	to be automatically devoid of any sort of declassification. And it would take an equal
3849520	3854320	and opposite executive order to remove this sort of mandatory non declassification standard. So I
3854320	3859120	never really had high hopes for the UAPDA. Anyways, there was always going to be the struggle of
3859120	3863920	eminent domain. And at some point, it was probably going to get shot down again. The encouraging
3863920	3873520	thing is that, of course, the UAPDA has been killed, but we still have our hearings coming up
3873520	3878400	in November. Sorry, I was looking at talent. You've tried contacting all the main UFO channels
3878480	3885280	and email and chat, all of them completely ignored. What is fake, man? Let me know what's going on.
3885280	3887360	What is going on here, bro? I'd like to hear about this.
3889280	3893600	But so let's talk about this Reddit post. And we'll check in with you, Tal, and see what you're
3893600	3897680	saying, because I just wanted to talk about this a little bit. This isn't a long line of another
3898720	3905440	Reddit 4chan whistleblowers who have made some strong statements, deleted their accounts,
3905440	3910960	or kind of gone AWOL afterwards. The famous one is the 4chan whistleblower that came out in 2023
3910960	3915920	who talked about the large hamburger 3D printing facility under water and kind of the ORBs,
3915920	3919520	the UAP ORBs really being hammers. Just something interesting I want to talk about. This is the
3919520	3924480	newest and the latest of long lines. I do plan to do full breakdowns on the last person I talked
3924480	3929920	about who talked about the acorn shaped craft being on a sort of gyroscope inspector and so forth,
3930000	3934800	and the 4chan whistleblower. But this, I'm going to read through this, and then I have
3936240	3940560	another one of these kind of anonymous sources that relates this a little bit.
3941280	3946320	Okay, remarkable job, 6468. And I will be trying to contact this individual who says,
3946320	3949840	I'm really nervous, scared, and not sure what to write, but I'll do what I can.
3950480	3954960	I don't expect anybody to believe me, but I made my dad a promise. He worked in the government and
3955040	3961280	told me he was in the more secretive side. He said that he worked with NASA from the Pentagon
3961280	3966880	closely from the 60s to the early 80s. Closely, very, very closely. He didn't tell me much on
3966880	3971600	his deathbed other than what I'll put below. He died from pancreatic cancer and didn't care
3971600	3976640	anymore about hiding things. I wanted to post this earlier, but I was really afraid. I don't even know
3976640	3980960	if this will be accepted or deleted or if anyone will believe me, but I'm keeping a promise.
3981600	3984800	My dad told me that the mood landings are definitely real. I already know there's going to be
3985680	3990160	controversy there, but there's more to it. He told me the race of the moon was an invitation
3990160	3997600	by aliens who watch Earth. That's why both of the Soviets and Americans were so crazy to reach it.
3997600	4001680	He told me he saw pictures that the public won't get to see and remembers it like yesterday.
4002240	4006160	Pillars clustered together in the background in pyramid-like structures.
4006800	4010720	Neil was giving a wide map of Earth as a gift to a creature that was half his size.
4011360	4018560	Neil, so Neil Armstrong, was giving a wide map of Earth as a gift to a creature half his size.
4018560	4022640	He told me the astronauts were not told about this until the very last moment for security reasons.
4023200	4027440	He told me the invitation was a test of humanity's capabilities and that the first
4027440	4032800	country to reach them would be partners with them. I always knew my dad as I grew up was a big shot,
4032800	4036320	but this was just too much. He told me he didn't think they would come after me,
4036320	4040160	but he said a dead man switch with someone if something happens to me because of this post.
4040800	4043760	I don't know what else to say really. I'm so anxious I want to puke,
4043760	4048560	but I want to see those pictures badly. Like I said, I don't expect anybody to believe me,
4048560	4053280	my dad, believe my dad or me, but I kept my promise he was really hopeful the last five years
4053280	4057280	before he died that things would be out there, but he has been mad at the government and told
4057280	4061520	me he doesn't care anymore. Anyways, I hope you all have a good day. Also, why did they remove the
4061520	4065280	content of my post but not lock it? They didn't even give me a reason. Of course, that's super
4065280	4071200	interesting to read. I have a little problem with the operational security of this line here,
4071200	4077120	not telling astronauts until the last very moment about possible sightings of creatures of non-human
4077120	4085120	intelligence that doesn't seem very... Oh, actually, this was posted in Aliens. If this was cross
4085120	4089520	posted in UFOs, I actually asked Joey, it's not my name, who's a mod there. What the heck happened
4089520	4093280	if that was removed? But that seems like terrible operational security, right? Not to tell these
4093280	4097360	astronauts who may have severe anxiety or panic attack upon. We need a creature half their size
4097360	4101680	that's of non-human intelligence. Now, this person right here, according to their dad, this isn't
4101680	4107440	the first testimony of individuals who state there's video or pictures of non-human intelligence or
4107440	4112240	UAP either en route to two or back from the moon or on the moon itself. I know I've talked about
4112240	4117760	an individual in the hidden within the Greer research files. There's also astronauts who
4117760	4126640	have made outstanding comments on astronauts who have made outstanding comments on NHIs such as
4126640	4132160	Gordon Cooper and of course, Buzz Aldrin. I found this interesting in particular, not by itself,
4132160	4141440	but because this reminded me back from June of another 4chan whistleblower, right? And this
4141440	4146480	reads a little bit to me like a lark. Of course, all of this could be... This reads a little bit
4146480	4152880	like a lark just of all the details. But this person talks about a program at 18 where he was
4153600	4160000	utilized on such as Gary McKinnon's non-terrestrial officer sent to the moon where there are pyramids
4160800	4164880	that when he got close to said pyramids, they kind of messed with human cognition similar to
4164880	4169600	other stories of getting in contact with the UAP itself. This could be drawn to stuff like the
4169600	4178640	witness I covered RA or possibly the infographics whistleblower and so forth. So I would call BS
4178640	4181920	just on the comment about the dead man switch requires user interaction to verify they're still
4181920	4186800	alive. Yeah, this post, the reason I wanted to talk about it was just because it reminded me closely
4186800	4192240	of this accountant. I like talking about these statements. I think there are some that probably
4192240	4196560	have more validity than others. If you guys read the one and I think it occurred in July,
4196560	4202960	it was about a person in the 24th STS, which is a special forces unit in JSOC that stated their
4202960	4208640	captain was kind of sent away to mysterious operations. And at one point he talked that he
4208640	4213360	kind of was on the case of the retrieval of a craft that really shook him to the core. So there's
4213360	4217920	some that are more believable than others. Generally, I find the more detail added, the more they are
4217920	4222800	a little hard to believe. That's why the statement about the astronauts not being told into the last
4222800	4227600	second and possibly the dead man switch is a little bit a little bit more as maybe a little
4227600	4231680	bit too much icing to the story, as well as this case right here. But this individual,
4232480	4238240	there's there's six shots. There's six shots of this. And I will post this in the discord as well.
4238960	4242320	If you guys want to talk about it more, because I don't want to just read through the whole thing,
4242320	4247280	right? There's so much. But the gist of it is this person is sent in like a non terrestrial
4247280	4250960	officers to the moon. I think under the moon surface, there's large caverns according to
4250960	4255280	this person, which are pyramid structures, as people get close to them, their cognition suffers
4255280	4262240	and so forth. I think I think this individual doesn't talk about seeing beans, but recalls
4262960	4270000	echoes and sounds in these caverns that likely were not made by by humans. So if you guys want to
4270000	4275200	at some point read through the whole thing, we can, but I won't do that now. Let me look through
4275200	4278960	some of these real fast. Check your email. I sent you a fascinating Reddit post from last year
4278960	4283680	that has since been removed. I saved, oh, from the molecular biologists. I think you're talking
4283680	4288240	about the EBE. Somebody was talking about that earlier. I think they stated this, this study
4288240	4293920	was done out of a Battelle laboratory near an army base, if any of you guys know specifically which
4293920	4299040	which base. That's a really interesting story. I know there's been a lot of back and forth on that
4299040	4304000	encounter. Again, I said I would talk to a biologist just because I'm, I know next and nothing
4304000	4312400	about biology. Thanks for pointing out the EO. I appreciate that, man. Good look at the data,
4312400	4316160	rather than just dismiss stuff because it doesn't fit your bias. There are things taken more seriously.
4316160	4321760	Yes, that's a, that's a great point up. Yeah, I might have a picture in my head of how I think
4321760	4325600	things work or what stories are true or not, but I still try and analyze almost any story I can,
4325600	4330720	even if things don't necessarily like scream true to me at first. I still think they're
4330720	4335200	worth checking out. Details of stories as well as kind of cross referencing to other cases. Let me
4335200	4344640	get a invite to the server here. Let me get an invite to the server. All you've got to do is watch
4344640	4347680	the press conference with the astronauts once they returned from the moon. They weren't happy. They
4347680	4352960	were in shock. I've seen that as well. I think it was, there was an individual in my discord who
4352960	4359920	was talking about this and he was saying that this clip is often used. The astronauts seem very
4359920	4364480	kind of distant. They seem dissociative from their current events. This could be because they
4364480	4368720	encountered something or just because they were so kind of shot from the mission at hand. I'm not
4368720	4373040	really sure. I haven't seen the, the, the video in a while, but that of course is referenced
4373040	4378960	quite a bit when people talked about, you know, especially the Apollo 11 crew discovering strange
4378960	4383120	things on the moon. And I think a bunch of people have asked me about this before. There's of course
4383120	4387280	Stephen Greer's whistleblower controversial. And I think I've talked about him just referenced his
4387280	4391600	name, Carl Wolf, who states that Wolf, sorry, that states there have been photos and images of
4391600	4397040	things on the moon. There are also multiple entries in Greer's DPI, their, his witness list in the
4397040	4402000	DPA archive. I think there's almost half a dozen of, of entries that state they saw photos of
4402000	4407120	structures and so forth on the moon. And then you have guys like Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 11 astronaut,
4407120	4411440	who I, does he still, does anybody know if he still talks about the Phobos monolith? Phobos,
4411440	4415680	a kind of a moon of Mars where there's a supposed monolith that Buzz Aldrin had talked about quite
4415680	4420640	a bit. What do you think about the alien biology reddit post? We'll talk about that once I can get
4420640	4426480	some biology under my belt. I think with, I think I would, we'll probably talk about this specific
4426480	4431200	one here with the moon in discord and we'll just kind of get things running. We don't need to get
4431200	4435520	too involved in that here just because I don't think there's much connection to ufology at a
4435520	4440400	wider scale besides maybe the integration of a non terrestrial officers list if it involves Gary
4440400	4445600	McKinnon's case. I want to cover the four chin whistleblower that talks mainly about the under
4445600	4451040	sea self replicating facility. The person I talked about in the Kecksburg video, the 24th STS guy
4451040	4455040	and the might and the biologist. If I can get somebody who understands biology and can actually
4455040	4461440	help me out because okay, this was in Fort Detrick. Okay. Yes. Okay. Fort Detrick, Maryland. I think
4461440	4466640	it's an army base and I think it's by Raven Rock, which is a huge underground facility. If I'm not
4466640	4473360	mistaken, anybody know where I can find the 2023 Greer timeline, UAP timeline? Are you talking about
4473360	4479760	the timeline that was given to Congress? I can send a link. If anybody has a, I don't know how
4479760	4486960	to send you a link either connect with me on email or come to the discord because that should be
4486960	4494160	posted there. Sorry, I'll get through the Battels National Biodefense Lab. Yes. And we know from
4494160	4502640	Vitell, they are direct. Oh, wrong one. Sorry. They are directly lobbying against the UAPDA. So
4503200	4507760	Vitell is always a customer of interest. Real quickly, I like this question. I know it's a
4507760	4511120	little bit outside of what we're talking about right now. What two piece of advice would you give
4511120	4516320	to a new BJJ student BJJ? If you guys don't know is Brazilian jiu-jitsu. This is my jam when I'm
4516320	4521200	not doing research or doing any sort of Tom Flurry. I'm trading jiu-jitsu. If you are a brand new
4521200	4527280	white belt starting off, I would really focus on conserving energy, knowing when to apply pressure
4527920	4533600	versus knowing when to back off. It is a, I can't tell you how many new guys will, you'll get them
4533600	4537760	in a good position side control, take their back, even something like get them in your close guard
4537760	4542160	and they will score them and you can feel them shaking their muscles are contracting so bad,
4542160	4547200	you will gas out incredibly quickly. So just focus on relaxing and applying strength and
4547200	4552240	technique only when needed. A lot of jiu-jitsu is about conserving energy, not applying it.
4552240	4557440	Number two, start to find, start to start working on your guard game early. You got to have a good
4557440	4561760	guard. If you want to smash, you got to be able to prevent the pass. That is what I would say.
4565200	4570240	Oh, sorry, I'll get to that in a second. Talon, what are you guys are talking about? I think in
4570240	4573440	the comments about Las Vegas. If some, if you guys are talking about that, fill me in.
4574400	4579360	King of NHI and BJG, no man, I'm just a purple belt in jiu-jitsu. One day, one day we'll get the
4579360	4586880	black belt, one day. Is it challenging? No, I'm in charge of neither guys. I am not in possession
4586880	4593920	of classified information on an HI. I just do research. I would very much like to be able to
4593920	4600880	have more information and I get smashed by black belts all the time. That Battelle Lab Post talks
4601440	4606000	about the alien religion again. Is that a sigh up or can they not disclose because of Cosmic Core
4606000	4613040	that we can't comprehend? This is the, the Battelle Lab Post is the biologist post, the Reddit
4613040	4618560	whistleblower. I think, am I right in saying that in that post, I'm just trying to reference off the
4618560	4624000	top of my head. This supposed individual references NHI religion in terms of kind of like a karmic
4624000	4630320	outlook where these beings kind of focus on their output of intentions into the universe
4630320	4635360	and so forth and kind of what comes back. I'm trying to remember off the top of my head. I haven't
4635360	4642960	read that in a good bit. Do you think of the recent Diddy allegations and indictments being
4642960	4648320	released at the same time when this topic of, I don't, probably not with, I don't think the subject
4648320	4653200	of, I think the stigma, I don't think Diddy and all this has anything to do with UAP. I think the
4653200	4657920	stigma does a dang fine job in not having people care about this. I'd still recommend trying to
4657920	4665040	talk to the average person in your life about UAP and NHI. I guarantee most of people would, will
4665040	4671040	laugh at you and say, nope, probably reference little green men. And then that's when you start
4671040	4677200	discussing facts and then they will back up. Connor, no, I had an open mind on UAP since I,
4677200	4682880	since the day I could read. This has always been kind of my top subject. When I was growing up,
4682880	4687680	part of the reason I went into engineering was I always had some little bit of fever dream
4688080	4691520	in my head that I could work on reverse engineering technology just because I was so
4691520	4700000	fascinated in particularly Bob Lazar growing up. So yep. So I'll put this down and then we'll talk
4700000	4704560	a little bit more about, we'll just do another little bit more questions right now. If you guys
4704560	4710240	want to talk about stuff, do some more Q&A for the 10K stuff. The stuff I talked about with the
4710320	4717840	neuro and sorry, and the kind of Woods Hole and so forth. This is a line of research I'm working
4717840	4723280	on right now. This is pretty new to me. Of course, the article came out two days ago and
4723280	4728960	Chris Shark does fantastic work. I can see why this portion of the article was removed. Remember,
4728960	4733040	guys, I'm not putting out any classified names or locations or anything. This was all public.
4733040	4736800	This is all public information I'm talking about, but I think there's a lot of really
4736800	4743040	interesting research avenues there. We focused on NSWC. Now we can focus on NUWC. We can focus on
4743040	4747600	all sorts of these underwater crash retrievals, which I think is a huge overlooked aspect of
4747600	4755120	crash retrieval. You can talk about 1964 Shag Harbor. I scour the career archives every single
4755120	4766560	day. If I can find out in what way this article, sorry, if I can find out what that piece of the
4766560	4770000	undersea triangle is referencing, if that's a case, if that's a whistleblower who has spoken to
4770000	4773760	Greer, I will try to do that as quick as possible because I'm fascinated.
4775360	4779920	Ortle Chow, thank you so much for the 10 bucks. I really appreciate it. I will continue to keep
4779920	4785680	doing this. This is my passion. Talking with you guys, as I know it's so many of yours. That's why
4785680	4791040	I'm very honored and just thankful to have everybody here. There's so many people in this,
4791040	4796720	the chat all the time and in the Discord. I want to shout out to Kai and Rectified in particular
4796720	4803760	for always having receipts, documents, and so forth to talk about. Kai, if you're still in here,
4803760	4811280	we will talk about Mark McCandlish as well very soon because if you're still here and want to know,
4811280	4816400	I will talk to you about the new developments in the case, but there's some really interesting
4816480	4822000	stuff. Talon, yes. My name's just Gerb in there. You can find me anywhere and anywhere as Gerb.
4823040	4828240	Sorry. Okay, some theme or someone. I used to dismiss Herrera due to the helicopter debunk.
4828240	4832480	I softened up to him once. Joey explained why the insider actually did take him to the facility.
4832480	4841200	Yeah, the helicopter photo is still probably one of the most contentious pieces around Michael.
4841680	4847360	Many people, including myself, believe that this was actually an individual named Ethan Dorian.
4847920	4852400	Now, Ethan is not available for comment. Joey has tried to reach out to this individual as well
4852400	4858240	and talk to him. I believe it was Ethan. He had an accident. I think it gave him brain damage.
4858240	4861440	It was just a random accident. I think it was with livestock or something,
4862160	4866480	but this is what myself and others believe. Of course, the issue with the camo match.
4866480	4870560	There are aspects of the camo that match up, but there are other aspects of the camo that
4870560	4874240	don't seemingly match up perfect. That's one of the biggest arguments against Michael.
4875120	4880400	Of course, just with the amount of content I've made on Michael, I think you guys know
4880400	4886320	I'm much more interested in this case and I do plan on probably having Michael on again in the
4886320	4892000	future. I think he even mentioned once he might be, because Michael and I both live in Colorado.
4892000	4895920	Maybe we'll link up to a live stream. I think that'd be a lot of fun to answer questions live
4895920	4903600	with him. I'd love to do that, but The Insider was another fantastical and hard to believe detail.
4903600	4909280	Yes, I completely understand as well when people talk about just the difficulty in believing about
4909280	4913520	The Insider, especially with the book like Sentinels of Ether and so forth. A lot of people like to
4914160	4919040	brush that off. This trick on Dobser that's so unlikely when there's books like Secret Machines,
4919040	4925440	there's in Jesse Michael's new video with Nick Cook. Names are escaping me right now,
4925440	4930560	but there was another kind of rocket scientist and anti-gravity researcher that wrote another
4930560	4937120	fiction on flying saucers. Actually, Kai, if you're in here in ARVs in the 60s, it's super
4937120	4943600	interesting as well. There is a lot more to that Michael's Insider story that I hope one day this
4943600	4948400	individual comes forward. That's what I hope and pray almost every single day. I would love that
4948400	4956320	more than anything because his testimony could be extremely powerful. In Nova Scotian, and now
4956320	4960800	thanks for everything you do. Love and peace. Thank you, man. Yeah, the Shag Harbor story.
4960800	4967840	That's a fantastic, fantastic case. I've heard from Justin Bush and Abduk T and former Marine
4967840	4971520	Corps that digital camouflage uniforms have actually matching patterns and some of his did.
4971520	4977040	Justin Bush is interesting. I'm part of a group that he just joined. I'd like to
4977680	4981040	I'd like to talk to him a little bit because he is a really interesting abduction case and I know
4981040	4986160	you guys know I've never really dipped my toes into abduction and so forth. This could be a
4986160	4991920	good opportunity to talk firsthand with somebody. What do you make of the large underwater structure
4991920	4998320	near Catalina Island coastal area disappearing off Google Maps relatively recently? Yes, I think
4998320	5003360	that's been posted by Timothy Gallaudet, too, of like a almost censored Google Maps piece.
5003920	5010400	So I believe I've actually talked to Ryan Wood about this. He has kind of theorized that there
5010400	5015280	might be two possible locations of interest of maybe underwater bases, maybe just hot spots of
5015280	5020880	USO activity, one off Catalina Island, one off of Florida. I also know institutions like UAPX have
5020880	5025760	been historically looking at Catalina Island in particular. So I think of any places to look,
5025760	5031120	that's probably a really, really, really good place to look. If you'd like to
5033280	5037680	vindicate Mike in that regard, yeah, so the camouflage you're referencing, yes, that is still
5038240	5045440	an ongoing thing to talk about, absolutely. And we got Max Parr in here. Max Parr just
5045440	5049520	shouted you out. Thank you so much. Keep up the good work, Herb. Sending support as always. Do
5049520	5054880	you think we'll get any documents from Nuro in the upcoming UAPDA release in October? I would,
5054880	5062560	I don't know. We might need to do some FOIA requests, especially Nuro projects or grants or
5062560	5067760	awards with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute now. That might be the new line of research to
5068800	5073600	pursue. Kermit may have told you about this, but I've been talking to him a little bit about the
5073600	5079840	research today on kind of Nuro and Chris Sharpe's article. So he might have brought that up with
5079840	5087360	you, but it's super, super, super interesting. Have you seen the Skinny Bob videos? I don't know.
5087360	5094000	There's been so much, so much debate like about Skinny Bob. I don't really have an opinion here
5094000	5099120	just because I don't really see an avenue to get to the bottom of this case. I think it's the same
5099120	5104320	with John Stewart's Alien Interview. There's just a kind of endless discussion about it.
5104320	5107520	I'll steer clear, there's plenty of research projects that I'm really passionate on that I
5107520	5111760	think I can really kind of advance the conversation around. I'll stick to those.
5111760	5116320	If there's a topic that I don't really think I can provide value on, I'll probably steer clear from.
5116320	5119920	This was kind of my take with Kecksburg just because there had been so much done on it,
5119920	5125200	but I really wanted to approach a few new angles kind of with Eric A. Walker with Johnson and so
5125200	5130720	forth. But if I don't think I can add, I'll probably just wait, just wait. The guy to do a
5130720	5135440	deep dive into Amy Eskridge that I would, I'll probably put her in a video alongside the likes
5135440	5142240	of guys like James E. McDonald. Amy Eskridge was interested in anti-gravity research who was,
5142240	5148240	I don't know if I can say the word on YouTube, but did pour things to herself. I think you get
5148240	5154320	demonetized on YouTube for saying such things. But yes, Amy Eskridge is a really, really,
5154320	5159120	really interesting case that deserves further research. I know a place in Outer Banks, North
5159120	5163040	Carolina, what play? Oh, like a underwater hotspot. I would love to hear more.
5165280	5168960	People used to dump huge amounts of toxic waste in the oceans out here by Cattle in the Island.
5168960	5176240	I did not know that. Foya, the videos from the fighter objects, fighter jets that shot down
5176240	5182080	the objects. Who knows if that Foya will even work it. I'm also trying to learn how to adeptly
5182160	5188880	use Foya. Otherwise, I might just ask and wait 36 months just to get nothing like I know many
5188880	5193200	people do. John Greenwald also gets frustrated with Foya requests and kind of gets played all
5193200	5199440	the time. Will we get videos? I don't know. Absolutely don't know. The skinny Bob videos
5199440	5205920	look like CGI. The movement looks like bad CGI. And then Starlinger is talking about the,
5206880	5213760	the skinny Bob videos are more interesting at 1.25 speed. I haven't watched skinny Bob for a
5213760	5219760	long time, so I really have no kind of valuable input right here. Max Barr, if you are a Foya
5219760	5225200	person, Neuro is a high value target for underwater UAP reports. Similar to NRO, National Reconnaissance
5225200	5229440	Office with fast walkers. It's the sister office focused on the ocean. Yeah, if you guys,
5230160	5233600	I've talked about fast walkers before, if you guys don't know about this, these are objects,
5233600	5239120	fast walkers and slow walkers entering or leaving earth's atmosphere. We talked quite a bit about
5239120	5244320	that in relation to Bob Fish and so forth and DSP, the defense support program. And
5245360	5250400	yes, Neuro, this is something I want everybody in here to keep research, research on. And Max,
5250400	5255280	you're getting a shout out by Hicology. Amy Eskridge, yeah, not so sure if she did that to
5255280	5258720	herself. Another person of interest that I will include there is Mark McCandlish. If you guys
5258720	5266400	don't know, Mark McCandlish was found dead in 2021, historically from a self-inflicted wound.
5267040	5275280	However, recent interviews dating back to like 2014, 2017 and so forth, Mark McCandlish spoke. He
5275280	5281120	slept with a pistol under his pillow in fear of his life. In 2014 as well, there was a documentary
5281120	5285200	made on Mark McCandlish called, I think it was called, Fluxliner and Zero Point Energy.
5285200	5290160	This was made by a filmmaker named James Allen. Before the completion of the film, James Allen
5290160	5295120	was diagnosed and dead with an extremely aggressive form of cancer within the span of a couple of
5295120	5299760	weeks. In his autopsy, he was also found to have suffered from heavy metal poisoning. So
5299760	5304960	a lot of weird deaths around that McCandlish story as well. So there has been a chemical
5304960	5309120	dump near Catalina Island in the 40s when the nation's largest manufacturer of DDT began
5309200	5312640	dumping waste into the water. I don't like to hear that.
5315360	5319600	So talking about Skinny Bob, the movement looks more realistic and fluid at 1.25 speed,
5320400	5324640	which appears matches the speed of the film they were shot on. Okay, yeah, I don't know about the
5325200	5330640	kind of original film. If what kind of film was Skinny Bob shot on, I know that probably plays
5330640	5338400	a huge role into analysis of the film. I just do not, not too, too familiar. Have you heard of
5338400	5343040	the Chains of the Sea story by that Lou references about alien arrival, yet they're here to talk to
5343040	5346960	other non human intelligence that exists on a deeper dimensional layer of reality on earth.
5346960	5350880	I know that piece, it's a, it's a book that Lou references, but I have not read it.
5351440	5355200	Chains of the Sea, I have it in a reading list, but no, I haven't, and I didn't even know what
5355200	5361680	it was about. So that is very interesting. So Frank Milburn, I have heard of Frank Milburn,
5361680	5366080	close friend of Amy Eskridge, that she was terrified before her ultimate demise,
5366800	5372320	which we'll talk about guys, because that is something or someone has a great point here,
5372320	5379840	bringing that up. Bart, any comment on Google and YouTube censoring regarding this topic?
5381360	5386480	I know there's, there's Ross and Timothy Gallaudet have talked about Google Maps in particular,
5387040	5394000	particularly censoring places like Catalina Island. I may be censoring, maybe just shadow
5394000	5400480	banning and so forth or shadow hiding results. But also, you have to remember that the vast
5400480	5406160	majority of the world populace and US populace still think that UAP is just a common conspiracy
5406160	5410160	theory and there's not much to it. And the story of little green men is for crazy people to make up,
5410160	5416160	which really infuriates me. Zach Brad Swanson from the Flexliner story should still be around.
5417120	5426560	Yeah. Yes, not all I'm going to say there, if you're listening is yes. Yes. Catalina is also
5426560	5430240	a point of operation for legit Coast Guard ops. I wouldn't think the blocking of Google images
5430240	5434480	is more mundane, but I could be wrong. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I do think it's interesting
5434480	5438560	that of all people, Timothy Gallaudet, if I'm remembering correctly, if I'm wrong, correct
5438560	5444960	me, because I don't want to misquote, talked about this specifically. Max Parr, have I looked into
5444960	5450000	the JDC two and the possibility of an accelerating UAP transparency, especially with the involvement
5450000	5456080	of Carl Nell, someone going on the record soon, I have not heard of JDC two. Let me let. No, I
5456080	5460880	have actually never heard of JDC two. If Carl Nell is talking and possibly somebody else going on
5460880	5466320	records, the joint all domain command and control Department of Defense program that aims to connect
5466320	5471200	military sensor and communications assets into a single network, the possibility of Nell speaking
5471200	5477440	and somebody else, possibly a first hand person going on record, that isn't I would love to hear
5477440	5484000	more about that. If you believe in angels and demons, you believe in aliens. So they kind of
5484000	5489360	in reference to like the Collins elite that Lou Elizondo talks about some powerful DoD figures that
5489360	5497920	revere UAP as demons and are somewhat terrified to look into the topic just due to religious reasons.
5498480	5503440	What information is she hand talking about that's supposed to be coming on October 18th? I have not
5503440	5510400	the faintest idea. I have not heard she hand talking about anything like that. I know he had an event
5510400	5515040	last night somewhere in Santa Cruz, I think it was. I think it was just to talk, but I have not heard
5515040	5524480	of it of him talking about specifically October 18th. Zach, we'll talk Brad Swaranson. I'm glad you
5525200	5533200	bring that up because I kind of want to save that for a piece on the candle. I have to have
5533200	5540080	some element of surprise. Terrible with withholding surprises, but that should be a fun piece of the
5540080	5546240	video. Has anyone figured out what the symbol on the bottom of Lou Elizondo's cup was? He blatantly
5546240	5551360	took a fake sip of the cup just before raising it to show the bottom. I've seen a lot of this
5551760	5562560	talk about Lou's cup. Now, I've seen the video. Is it for sure a fake sip from his cup?
5563360	5566880	Because I'm not sure what the symbol is. I know there's been a lot of analysis on this, but
5568000	5571120	to me at least I couldn't see anything recognizable in that clip.
5572320	5577760	So, Bart, you're saying the censoring is so bad. Searching your own YouTube watch histories hides
5577760	5581760	the video. That's interesting. There has been, I think, a couple of people who have said they've
5581760	5588240	been unsubscribed from the channel. Whether that's nefarious, I don't know. I won't make any accusations
5588240	5598560	maybe, but I don't know. Hiding from your watch history, that is weird. So, October 18th, that
5598560	5602880	UAP records are due to the National Archives. According to some folks, the file size is 1.3
5602880	5606400	terabytes. Yeah, Lester Nair has spoken about this. Some of these files are actually available.
5607280	5611600	What, if there's any impactful files, we shall see. I know in the available files right now,
5611600	5618880	a lot of them are files from Greer and so forth. So, I don't think there's a ton to go off on
5618880	5625760	those. I don't have too high of hopes for National Archives files, but I'd love to be proved wrong.
5627120	5630400	You know, the video is based when there's a Wikipedia disclaimer above the description.
5630880	5636480	The thing is, I'm not even sure why Kecksburg, why there would even be, in the latest video,
5636480	5643040	a disclaimer. I mean, the Kecksburg Wikipedia page just talks about the story and doesn't offer any
5643040	5649920	of the conventional explanations. It even talks about the Cosmos 96 story being kind of refuted.
5649920	5656960	And, you know, of course, there's stuff like that on other videos, but that in particular,
5656960	5661520	why do I keep looking to my left? I got another monitor over here and I'm just looking at it to
5661520	5665360	just ensure other stuff is going on good. I'm sorry, I'm not a crack and I promise, but I got
5665360	5670000	another screen up there. So, I'm just, if I'm looking off to the side, it's just because there's
5670000	5675280	another screen. It's nothing else interesting. Regarding Lou's interview, I've seen the full
5675280	5679280	video and it's not as suspicious when you watch the full thing. He audibly sips multiple times,
5679280	5685440	at least on the bottom of the mug. You know, a lot of the time price tags come on the bottom of the
5685440	5691840	mug. I do see a world in which this was like a tag that just kind of got a bit mangled and wet and
5691840	5696800	disheveled, but I have not kind of clued in on if this was a secret message or not.
5698640	5703120	Have I had a chance to see the hundreds of pages of Canadian documents on the UAP shoot downs in
5703120	5708240	Feb of 2023? No, but I have that on a list of stuff to look through. Deadfish in the comments
5708240	5712880	earlier was talking about possibly witnessing this event in person and he's making a video on it
5712960	5718640	where he's interviewed witnesses and so forth, including himself. So, I would really, really,
5718640	5720240	really like to see that when it's done.
5724320	5728320	Probably dead end, but have you looked into the alleged recordings of landings on military base,
5728320	5732720	the Holloman landings? Yes, I have. And I will talk about that. Specifically, Gordon Cooper, this
5732720	5738400	occurred in 1954. Gordon Cooper said he saw this film and it was recorded by his team,
5738400	5742800	his team of surveyors on the site at Holloman Air Force Base, where a craft, I think it was
5744000	5749040	a bit of a classic saucer design and I think, I can't remember if he discussed like landing gear
5749040	5754240	and landing mechanisms here, but touchdown and departed. And there's also the famous story of
5754240	5760080	Eisenhower and I think this was also in 1954 meeting and creating agreements with NHI too.
5760080	5761520	That's of course a very famous story.
5762080	5768640	The symbol on the bottom of Lou's cup is described as tape, but I'm sure that NSA could have a
5768640	5772640	listening device as thin as that to plan on somebody if they're tracking. It would be funny if Lou
5772640	5779200	found it. Absolutely. I mean, I'm sure he's probably being tracked in multiple ways. Absolutely.
5779200	5784320	Wikipedia is totally compromised by guerrilla skeptics. Yes. What a, if anybody could remind me,
5784320	5791120	what was the story of Mick West? I think he was either changing Wikipedia entries or his own
5791120	5796640	Wikipedia bio was changed. If anybody could fill me on what that story was, I'd love to remember.
5797440	5801200	There, of course, I've even talked about improved various edits of stuff being deleted,
5801200	5806960	like in the Koyama case where there's no reason for deletion and also no sighting of sources by
5806960	5814080	Wikipedia people. And it's very frustrating. Is there any reason to think that forgotten
5814080	5818240	languages is not a LARP? It kind of seems like it may have been made by a crazy person
5818240	5821440	posting nonstop for 15 years on encrypted format in an ARG of LARP.
5823680	5828560	Any reason to, like any evidence I have off the top of my head or on hand to say it's not a LARP?
5828560	5833840	No. But that requires a full investigation. Of course, it is very strange. And of course,
5833840	5838480	at first glance and kind of looking through the encryption and so forth, it seems like a crazy
5838480	5843520	mofo kind of worked on this page with the amount of encryption, the amount of strangeness and so forth.
5844000	5850160	Radilio, that's a cute dog, by the way. What are your thoughts on Bob Lazar? So we talk about this,
5850160	5855600	I'd say almost every video, I personally do not comment on Bob Lazar because I cannot separate
5855600	5860960	my own biases away from the facts of the case. There are arguments for and against Bob Lazar.
5860960	5865360	I want more than anything for his case to be true because it had quite an impact on my childhood.
5865360	5870400	You can see the sports model behind me that Bob Lazar created. So I tend to stay away from Bob.
5870400	5874240	I have positive things to say about him, my negative things to say about him. I hope more
5874240	5878960	than anything that his case is true. But it did leave a bad taste in my mouth after the
5878960	5883600	2023 hearings when he said, I told you so without testifying. I didn't really like that.
5886480	5890000	You familiar with the whole theory that these crash and landed UAP, we recover our gift to
5890000	5894320	push our technological and cultural evolution in a particular direction? Absolutely, donation
5894320	5899600	theory. This was talked about by Grush in the Ross Goldhart interview that many of these craft
5899600	5904480	have been just kind of found left unattended in his own words. And this was also the crux of the
5904480	5908720	story of third hand arrow whistleblower Eric Tabor who stated that his, I think it was great
5908720	5914640	grandfather, great, great uncle at area 51 encountered and heard the story of an egg shaped
5914640	5919920	craft that was found in the Nevada desert, just completely unattended and left alone. So yes, I
5921440	5928160	the argument versus craft versus donation craft is one that I kind of often try and keep in mind
5928160	5934560	during every crash retrieval video I make. I really want to hear more stories where some of these
5934560	5940800	craft have supposedly been found just left unattended. Because I mean, if Grush specifically
5940800	5945360	talked about this, he made a specific point to access that some of these craft are almost appeared
5945360	5951440	to be gifted, that I think there's a lot of things worth checking out here. Good trouble
5951440	5954800	did. Yeah, good trouble is great. Matt from the Good Trouble show. Yes. Are you talking about
5954800	5961680	Wikipedia? Please. Any stories, cases that you initially dismissed as BS but came around to
5961680	5966960	later post 2017. I'm a lot more open minded about this kind of thing. That's a good question.
5968240	5977920	Geez, I'd say before probably the 1992 Long Island case, I initially just dismissed it as
5977920	5983200	hearsay, but I think there's a lot of investigation that has been done that's worth discussing a lot
5983200	5989600	more investigation that needs to be talked about that case. 1992 Long Island. Spent a lot of time
5989600	5996880	researching the forgotten language. Oh, Matt Ford. Okay, so Matt Ford did an episode on this.
5996880	6001040	So, Huckology. Yes, you did spend time on the Forgotten Languages website and the guy turned
6001040	6006080	out to be a convicted fraudster. I can dig through the docs, links when I get home five minutes. Yes,
6006080	6009440	please, that would be super helpful. Okay, that'd be great to talk about.
6009520	6015680	It's strange that David Grush has mentioned of having firsthand knowledge edited out of his
6015680	6021440	News Nation interview with Elizabeth Vargas. Yes, it was. Because a lot of people have stated that
6021440	6026240	Grush has not had firsthand knowledge, which he has stated multiple times he has. And this
6026240	6031760	piece was edited out, as well as there was a small piece that was edited out of the July
6031760	6036240	congressional hearings, right, the official video. I can't remember what exactly that was, but yes.
6036320	6040880	There would be no Half-Life game without Bob Lazar, hey. Half-Life is a fantastic game and
6040880	6046400	hopefully Half-Life 3 is being worked on. Looked into the Reynolds from Forest incident,
6046400	6050160	forgot the U.S. company involved, but Professor Simon Hollins has been digging into that interesting
6050160	6055760	stuff. Yes, I have looked at a lot of the witness testimony around Reynolds from Forest. And I would
6055760	6059360	like to make a video on it when I feel like I have something new to contribute to the case,
6059360	6065280	because it has been talked about so much. I don't like doing cases if I'm just
6066080	6070720	rehashing stuff, everything other people have talked about. Sorry, I'm just going to get some
6070720	6075440	water. I'm going to move away from the mic. But absolutely.
6077840	6081680	Rogan mentioned how many times Lazar explained something to him in a private chat and explained
6081680	6085840	a few things. I can only assume he doesn't want to admit to any crimes. Yes, throughout the,
6085840	6091440	I think it was 2017, Jeremy Corbell and Bob Lazar video on JRE. Numerous times there was
6091440	6096640	reference to discussions being had about various topics that occurred at dinner the night before.
6099120	6102960	I'd like to see Joe talk about this a little more, especially because I have,
6102960	6107120	do have problems with how Joe treats guests like Bob Lazar and Travis Walton versus Lou Elizondo
6107120	6113680	and David Grush. Give Elon Musk one year with one of those. One of what? A retrieved craft?
6114400	6120640	I'd like to see it. Max, guys, any comment from Max is well worth reading. This is for any
6120640	6125760	anthropologist out there. If anyone is an expert with or know someone who studies Berber history
6125760	6130400	slash symbology, please reach out to me. Some weird similarities to she hand symbols. Okay,
6130400	6135360	that is, that's interesting. Guys, if anybody is an anthropologist, either talk to Max or talk to
6135360	6138720	me and I'll get you hooked up with Max because Max is one of the best researchers I know.
6141280	6144880	They say that anyone can say an element number and they'll be right just like 115, which is now
6144880	6151120	known as a night now. I think 115 is a Mozgovium, right? 115 is Mozgovium. It was synthesized in
6151120	6158320	2004 as an unstable element in Russia. But yeah, you're right. Anybody can just claim a random
6158320	6163440	atomic number that hasn't been synthesized or proven to exist beyond theory yet.
6165040	6168720	Seems like it could be a mix of donation landings and crashes and also maybe some shootdowns using
6168720	6174400	exotic weaponry like Herrera talked about with his insider. Yes, Greer and others have talked about
6174400	6180880	the shootdowns as well, including some people I've talked about on the channel. Yeah, one solution
6180880	6185040	isn't mutually exclusive, just like there could be multiple factions of NHI, multiple origins of
6185040	6190080	NHI on the planet. There could be multiple modus operandi for NHI. Possibly some of these are,
6190080	6195760	their craft are forced landing such as the Kingman crash. Possibly some of these are being shot down.
6195760	6200880	Possibly some of these are donated, maybe a particular species and that command some of
6200880	6206880	these egg shaped craft. These almost seemed like a formed in a piece of liquid metal shaped craft
6206880	6214960	like to just donate these craft. I predict element 119, we'll say it powers something when it's
6214960	6220960	synthesized. The gift theory permits the Prometheus myth and the serpent in the garden. Pretty spooky
6220960	6225440	if there's something to it. Yeah, Prometheus who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man.
6225440	6231040	It is, it is a, it is a kind of disturbing and sobering theory, but also very inspiring to know
6231040	6237360	that there could possibly be some sort of species that is trying to encourage this species on this
6237360	6245280	planet to try to pursue a certain lineage of technological evolution. The gifts donations
6245280	6250080	are a test we are not passing. I think even without the donations, we would pretty much fail to pass
6250080	6255280	any test with the way in which humans kind of treat each other and treat this planet.
6255920	6259840	Congrats on the 10k. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. Thank you.
6260800	6266800	Shardul, Intel background throws up Rogan's red flags. I think, I think we talked about it last
6266800	6272240	time, but it's really comical to me how Mike Baker, the former CIA agent shows up. I think he has 14
6272240	6279280	appearances on JRE almost after every single UFO guest. Joe, maybe I don't, I don't know if Joe is
6279280	6286400	necessarily nefarious. I just think that Joe's Joe. What are your thoughts on Dan Burrish?
6286400	6289600	Night Shift made a good video, quite detailed, compelling story personally, but what are your
6289600	6295040	thoughts? So I've listened to Dan Burrish's, I've listened to his like two hour interview,
6295040	6300640	I think two or three times through. I've also read the Project Quarious document,
6300640	6306960	the really long piece that details the 3D makeup of S4. I think those drawings were done by Michael
6306960	6316160	Schrat. And it's, Burrish's story is, it almost, almost in a way, and this isn't discussing his
6316160	6322400	credibility or anything seems too perfect. It's just so detailed, incredibly. I know Burrish is
6322400	6328720	still out there. I know he's difficult to track down. I would love to speak to him. I find some
6328720	6332640	of the most interesting stuff he talks about, not necessarily J-Rod, but the craft and levels
6332640	6336240	at S4. That is probably what I'd want to pursue because at least according to the drawings from
6336240	6340400	Michael Schrat, the location while Burrish was there and described, there was the Roswell
6340400	6345600	recovered craft, there was an ARV that at least according to Michael Schrat's modeling or whoever
6345600	6350240	created the modeling and sketches for this place looked very similar to the Fluxliner,
6350240	6356560	Mark McCandless, ARV craft. Doesn't Lazar have a sample of 115 hidden away? He states he does,
6356560	6360400	and I think Area 51, Bob Lazar and Flying Saucers, the documentary from Jeremy Corbell,
6360400	6364720	stated that this was why the FBI raid occurred, although I don't know if they're supporting
6364720	6374720	evidence of that. I think George Knapp stated he had a recording of the element 115 being utilized
6374720	6380160	to power or like a makeshift reactor or something, but taped over the videotape, which is also
6382160	6388240	not a great statement. Keep up the good work. Thank you, brother. Nightingale is the middle
6388240	6393360	that retains its shape. Yes, this is what I myself and others have theorized was discovered at the
6393360	6400080	Roswell crash, likely and sent to Patel as a titanium nickel alloy to study as the shape retaining
6400080	6405760	metal or memory metals. You should look into the aerogel, air alloy vacuum drones and the U.S. Navy
6405760	6410800	nemesis system. If the tick tax, not NHI, these systems tech may be the closest possible possible
6410800	6415680	explanation. Cool. That's I've actually never, I think I've heard briefly of the aerogel,
6415680	6420400	air alloy vacuum drones, but not the U.S. Navy nemesis system. So absolutely.
6420960	6426800	Personally, I believe the vast majority are spy satellites, UAP or spy satellites.
6429600	6433840	Matt Ford posted the gloves are off at the end of a statement in the Disclosure Act getting cut.
6433840	6438480	I assume this means catastrophic disclosure or catastrophic gorilla disclosure. Yeah,
6438480	6443280	I mentioned this before. I'm of the mind where even with the passing of the UAPDA,
6443280	6446960	to get it passed fully, there would still be arguments about eminent domain and so forth.
6446960	6451600	I also think more whistleblower protections need to be put in before any meaningful whistleblowers
6451600	6456480	come forth. I also do think there probably needs to be amnesty clauses for legacy program members
6456480	6463520	and so forth. There still was some teeth missing from there and I probably catastrophic disclosure,
6463520	6468160	hopefully in a non too catastrophic way is probably going to be our way forward.
6469360	6472640	Dick Cheney is the head of UAP secrecy. It's fascinating. Yesterday I think Dick Cheney was
6472640	6478720	also mentioned by, he was mentioned by Barish, right, as J2 in the Majestic 12. I think so.
6479920	6484560	What do you make of the claims that the ARVs are using zero point free energy systems? I think that,
6485520	6489280	especially with the flux liner from Mark McCandless, that he states is under
6491360	6498000	kind of zero point and so forth. Sorry. I probably say that there's some validity to these claims,
6498000	6503280	early MHD anti-gravity systems, electro-gravidics, especially the Mark McCandless story just because
6503280	6509680	I think that of most of the whistleblowers Greer talked to in the 2001 disclosure project,
6509680	6513760	I think McCandless probably has the most interesting and fascinating story and something that is
6513760	6523600	still very relevant to today. So I think that a zero point, I've heard rumors that of various types
6523600	6528640	of propulsion systems for ARVs, including electro-gravidics and so forth, but zero point,
6528640	6532240	that corresponds to McCandless's story, and I find that a fantastic one.
6532960	6538640	The Susan Goev, Rogan. Two detailed, like Cliff Stone and Dan Eyre. Yeah, Clifford Stone,
6539600	6543840	that is somebody I particularly left out at the Kecksburg video. He made outstanding comments
6543840	6548000	on Kecksburg, but he is somebody just because I wanted to analyze fully because of some of his
6548000	6556400	claims being a little bit too descriptive and final that just to leave out. Oh, no, no, no,
6556400	6561360	you're good, George. It's okay. I'm not a chemist. I'm sure a lot of people aren't chemists. There's
6561360	6566320	a lot of dang elements to keep track of. Have I heard of the Eyes on Cinema YouTube channel? How
6566320	6570880	many archived recordings video? I don't know how the heck they get their files, but Eyes on Cinema
6570880	6575920	is great. I'd love to know who actually runs the account. It seems like they have media that has
6575920	6580800	never been seen before. Their new video on Area 51 is also great. I think they posted it a day or
6580800	6587200	two, so I'd really recommend watching that. According to Wikipedia, Mozgovium, this is in
6587200	6592080	relation to Bob Lazar and Element 115, is a super heavy synthetic radioactive chemical element, also
6592080	6597520	known as EK-A-Bismuth. Richard Dolan supposes metamaterial is a bismuth alloy. Is there a
6597520	6602320	connection? I'm not sure, but I've also heard of the bismuth connection, but I do not know. I don't
6602400	6607120	even know if there's been able to be a Mozgovium that's been a stable element. I think it decays
6607120	6612160	after a very, very, very short period, and there's never as far to the length of my knowledge.
6613200	6620000	Lab's been a stable version of Mozgovium. Rogan is so flip floppy, it honestly annoys me. He'll be
6620000	6624560	all in one secret, then says his BS in the next podcast. Yeah, I used to be a huge Joe fan, but
6624560	6628800	I've had a little bit of a grudge against him ever since Grush was on there. I really don't like the
6628800	6635840	way he treated Grush. Maybe they just, when wandering around and about, forgot to turn on the
6635840	6639360	cloaking, we stumble upon their ship and they came back to a bunch of boomsticks monkeys forming on
6639360	6645040	their ship quite possibly. Yeah, there are stories of cloaked UAP, especially with Danny Sheehan
6645040	6650240	talking about the golden domes detection methods, which can actually detect cloaked UAP. Of course,
6650240	6654880	low observability is one of the six observables, according to Lou Elizondo. So maybe they go out
6654880	6661440	to forage some berries and come back to that. The recent Eyes on Cinema school sighting was that on
6661440	6669440	Westall School in Australia, because that's a great case. As a Greek, I could very clearly read
6669440	6675200	the engravings on the Roswell Debris. It reads, which means freedom, maybe a hoax. Cool. Are you
6675200	6681200	talking about like the eye beam from Jesse Marcel Sr. and Jr.? Is there anything to Jason
6681920	6686160	say? He seems low credibility. Eric Davis said he lied about being one of Grush's 40.
6686160	6691440	Him being on Twitter, Gary Nolan criticized him too. I think we do have to step back from Eric
6691440	6695280	Davis a little bit on there. Eric Davis has been chatting quite a bit lately, especially about Lou
6695280	6702800	too. I think that I am trying to analyze Sans' story in a vacuum far away from the Twitter stuff
6702800	6708800	and a lot of the kind of Twitter space that has come with it. I know multiple intelligence community
6708800	6716960	people that all think Jason Sans is a fantastic person. They hold him to a huge, they hold him to
6716960	6720560	such a high regard. They say he's a wonderful human. The reason why he may have gone on Twitter and
6720560	6726320	so forth was just because he's that type of guy who just talks quite a bit. So these are people
6726320	6730960	I trust and they all speak very highly of Sans. They can, of course, can't prove his story,
6730960	6737360	but they all support Sans. So I'm trying to approach Sans' story from a lens of kind of openness,
6737360	6741920	just because I would like to speak to him if I get the chance to. But I do think that sometimes
6741920	6745760	Sans doesn't really draw the line where he's speculating versus talking about firsthand
6745760	6752640	knowledge. And I think that can be a little bit of a problem. The person who breaks the biggest
6752640	6756400	story in history is not going to prison, especially as reported, their deaths are attributed to the
6756400	6762560	program. Yeah, but if it's a firsthand witness, they could lose their pension and if they're not
6762560	6766880	getting a big media deal or something like that, they and their family will have no money.
6766880	6770880	That's at least what I know is an issue with some whistleblowers, not the threat of death,
6770880	6776640	but the threat of pension pension removal. I would bet Kissinger was MJ one up until his passing.
6776640	6781440	I think according to British Kissinger was like MJ five, MJ six. There was another person that
6781440	6786320	had implicated Kissinger in MJ 12. I can't remember who it was. What kind of music does
6786320	6793200	Gerb listen to? I'm a big hip hop head. But I do not like a pop hip hop. So I'm a bit more classic
6793200	6798720	of like, I like like the old Kendrick Lamar Denzel Curry, some classic 90s rap. I also like
6798720	6802960	electronic music in Juno Deep. They're probably my favorite producer. I love listening to their
6802960	6806880	projects, but a little bit of everything, man. I'm just not a big pop music kind of guy.
6808880	6812320	Max Barr says, do you think it's morally right to keep zero point energy from the public to the
6812320	6816160	disclosure of zero point collapse or civilization due to economic instability or something else?
6816880	6822880	I feel like this is such a difficult question to ask now, especially if zero point energy
6822880	6829200	systems have been in practice for decades, if for years, if not decades, right now, the introduction
6829200	6835360	of zero points systems, I think would certainly collapse economies and collapse systems as we
6835360	6840480	know it might have to completely shift to a global resource based economy as zero point systems would
6840480	6846880	fix most energy crisis and production crisis and travel crisis and fossil fuels. I do think
6846880	6850480	it's morally wrong to have kept zero point energy from the public, especially if it was
6850480	6858880	conceived back 50, 60, 70s or so on, but also having that sort of, if for the average person to
6858880	6865600	have access to that sort of technology could be very dangerous. Just like nuclear, the formation
6865600	6869920	of a nuclear bomb, the blueprints are kept classified, but the actual knowledge and use of
6869920	6874160	nuclear technology is not, I think zero point systems should be the same. But yes, I do think
6874160	6878560	it's morally wrong, but that raises such a quandary of having to completely reassess how
6878640	6881760	global economies, global markets and global governments work.
6883520	6888880	McCandless could have been fed disinformation. Mark never saw anything, but his friend told
6888880	6894640	him about it. His friend is Brad Sorensen, and do I think Brad Sorensen is disinfo? No, I do not.
6896720	6900880	My pupils, my boy, those pupils, what are you on, my friend? A little bit of cold brew
6900880	6905440	and some bright lights, man, some bright lights and trying to read. Nothing, nothing else.
6905440	6909920	Have I read through imminent? Yes, yes, I have actually read it in almost reverse order. I've
6909920	6916320	read it on a chat on a specific chapter basis. Any thoughts on why conventional jet aircraft
6916320	6921360	and weapon systems continue to be developed if ARV exists, money laundering, ARV may not be
6921360	6929040	reliably prohibitively expensive for mass production. Yeah, who knows the cost of producing
6929040	6934880	one ARV craft? Who is in control of the ARV, what program? There could possibly be elements of the
6934880	6940480	breakaway type civilization here just because Locking Martin has, let's say, a Martin McCandless's
6940480	6946000	flux liner doesn't mean it's going to be shared and doesn't mean if they have one flux liner,
6946000	6949840	doesn't mean it's going to be put into production or its blueprints are going to be shared to keep
6949840	6956400	an asymmetric advantage. Of course, as well as David Grush says that the reverse engineering
6956400	6961840	is used for feudalistic dominance and asymmetrical advantages. So I think there's
6962480	6966800	quite a few reasons why. Not sure all your cards yet. Who knows, maybe if there was a
6966800	6971680	global conflict, you would see a Northrop Grumman or Locking Martin ARV. I certainly like to,
6971680	6978800	but not in that context. No one wants to know Ross Colt Hart's source if he revealed the location.
6978800	6982880	Okay, while no one wants to know Ross Colt Hart's source, if he revealed the location
6982880	6990080	with the UFO under the building, would you want to go ninja? If he revealed the location,
6990240	6996880	would I, I just, as far as I know, there could be national security implications and violations
6996880	7003360	if he revealed this place. If he did, ninja in the sense of researching for probably 30 hours
7003360	7008800	nonstop to try to get to the bottom of this. Yes, absolutely. Okay, recording to McCandless,
7008800	7013920	someone should file a FOIA to verify the presence of the US Senator that McCandless alleges was
7013920	7018240	president at the air show and saw the ARBs. Oh, okay, this is in my notes, man. What was the,
7019120	7023680	I just wrote this down, who Brad Sorenson said he was with. He said it was a former
7023680	7031520	like director of some sort of intelligence director, a tall white Italian man with white hair.
7031520	7035040	He names the name who he thought it was. I just can't remember it right now, but
7035040	7042160	yeah, absolutely. That individual is no longer with us. I wanted to contact him, possibly his
7042160	7047040	children. Ryan would always talk about sometimes if kids are adults, now of their parents implicating
7047040	7050640	some of these stories, just reach out to them, see if they know anything about it. So absolutely.
7051360	7058800	That's his right to change his mind in what, in what, oh, in regards to Joe. Yeah, I think it's
7058800	7063840	just towards the treatment of guests in relation to Bob Lazar versus people like Grush and Elizondo.
7063840	7068000	It's just a bit strange. What is your favorite case of antiquity? I understand Lou being more
7068000	7072800	interested in modern incidents, pre-reports, pre-47. Of course, there's the Aurora incident,
7072880	7079440	but I'd say Cape Girardeau, 1941. Yeah, Kai, I'll find the name and I'll let you know. I haven't
7079440	7085120	written down. I just don't have the notebook on me right now, but yes. Got to check out the Groom
7085120	7088880	Lake mine Ryan Wood was talking about. I found a few articles, Nothing Juicy, not even sure how to
7088880	7093600	start that one. Yeah, I think it's a boron mine right in the Groom Lake area, which would be the
7093600	7098400	perfect foundation for an underground facility. And that was started well before the creation of
7098400	7103120	the Area 51 facility, which is mentioned, which is managed by Edwards near at Groom Lake.
7104640	7111360	The I-beam Reads Freedom. Do you know if Jesse Marcel has sketched out what he saw the symbols
7111360	7116560	specifically because I see a lot of I-beam photos and so forth, but I don't know if the symbols are
7116560	7123840	exactly true to exactly what Jesse described. Everybody's going to pretend, put some shades on.
7123840	7128400	Well, that's because I got a light right in front of me, man. But I think my pupils are
7128400	7134160	normal sized, I think. I don't see anything wrong with my pupils. But who knows, man.
7134160	7138160	The fact that MH370 videos are so compelling yet you won't even give it on is concerning.
7141040	7145760	I'm sorry that it's concerning to you, but I won't. My honest opinion is that I'm just
7145760	7150240	not engaged with the videos right now. And that's because I know there's so much toxicity
7150240	7154240	and drama around them. And also, my research style, there's so much other stuff I'm trying to
7154240	7159520	focus on right now that I will leave the MH370 videos to others at the moment.
7162640	7166880	Have you read imminent? And any comment on the Divide UFO Talking Heads are having on
7166880	7172080	Elizondo stating, overstating his role and responsibilities at ATIP and Stratton going
7172080	7176960	to release his own book. This has become such a conundrum, right? And there's been so many
7177920	7181680	like Twitter personalities and Twitter people discussing this. And
7185280	7190000	John Greenwald made a great video with the OSAP ATIP documents. I really don't know what to make of
7190000	7198160	it. I really don't. There's just so much foreign against Lou. But do I think Lou is dishonest and
7198160	7204000	a liar? No. But maybe there's some overstating his role and so forth. But hopefully we can get to
7204000	7208400	the bottom of this. I'm sorry. I know I'm kind of rambling on that subject. It's been really
7208400	7211760	weird to follow. And it seems like every day there's a new development or a new statement from
7211760	7217280	Stratton, Stratton's wife, Eric Davis, and so forth. OpTV, thank you so much, man. Been here
7217280	7223680	since 3K. I know a lot of people have. I appreciate that. Corona. Eric Weinstein suggests if NHI
7223680	7227040	has time travel, they could be looping back to Preventus from getting evidence of them. We need
7227040	7230880	our own disinformation countermeasures for disclosure to make that happen. If they're looping back
7230880	7234720	in time, that introduced the awesome theory of the bootstrap paradox. If they're looping back in
7234720	7239360	time because then eventually in the future, that same civilization will go back in time. And that
7239360	7245040	means there's an endless loop of these NHI going back. That's a fun time travel paradox to go down.
7245040	7250240	Eric Weinstein, I'm excited. I'm happy he started to talk more about UAP. I think Eric Weinstein
7250240	7255200	is extremely intelligent. Sometimes he is a little bit too intelligent for his own good,
7255200	7261200	but I'd like to see him weigh in more on NHI. The issue of anti-gravity is extremely difficult.
7261200	7264720	In one side, it can transform the planet into eotopia. Under a year on the other side, it can
7264720	7269920	trigger World War III in a few hours. Absolutely. And the study of anti-gravity of late, Jesse
7269920	7275120	Michaels has been knocking out the park with his videos. What's an ARV? Oh, sorry if we haven't
7275760	7280960	talked about this. Yeah, HECOLOGY mentioned an alien reproduction vehicle. This term was coined by
7280960	7287520	Mark McCandlish when his friend Brad Sorensen stated at Norton Air Base in 1988, November,
7287520	7292800	at an air show. He was taken to a classified division with three craft of a kind of a saucer
7292800	7297120	type shape, not like two saucer dishes pressed against each other, but like the top half of the
7297120	7301840	saucer with a ball on top were called alien reproduction vehicles came in three sizes operated
7301840	7305840	off of I think Sirpointe Energy, possibly ElectroGravityx or MHC Plasma. But yes.
7306800	7310720	Have you read the account of Dan Sherman above black? No, this is still at the top of my list
7310720	7314560	because I've been recommended so much, but I'll be fully honest, I haven't been able to get through
7314560	7320640	it yet. But I really want to. Have you heard of the Q94 non-human tissue sample? Is this the
7320640	7325040	implant? I can't remember. Is this the implant everybody's been talking about?
7326240	7332320	Hello, Eric Davis's boss reported to Lou Elizondo, and that was that was how put off or
7332640	7336880	I can't remember. There's so many dang names. I'm having trouble remembering right now.
7337440	7341680	Sorry about that. Can't wait to read about the Scott Andrews story when it comes out.
7341680	7344880	Everyone seemed to have forgotten about that one, including myself. Scott Andrews,
7344880	7349280	that's on the tip of my tongue. Shardles remind me of the Scott Andrews story. I know this,
7349280	7354240	but I'm forgetting. Are there alleged crash retrievals in Florida? No, but I think there's
7354240	7358960	McDale Air Force Base in Florida, which has been implicated with retrieval stories and so forth.
7358960	7361840	As far as I know, I can't think of any retrieval stories off the top of my head,
7361840	7367600	but there is McDale AFB, which is of interest. Of course, Joe has the right to change mine,
7367600	7372000	but it's disingenuous to be one way with one guest and the next have a different guest and
7372000	7376080	say it's all probably BS. I agree. Yeah, I just don't like how he talked about,
7378080	7383200	talked to Grush and reference him. This guy knows what he's talking about. That's why
7383200	7386960	you're getting this. I appreciate that. A lot of the time I ramble, man. I only know what I'm
7386960	7391200	talking about when I sit down, when I have time to sit down and write like a 7,000 word
7391200	7395040	script and then record it. That's when I know what I'm talking about. Otherwise, I can ramble.
7395600	7401360	Any cool dreams recently? No, not really. My dreams are always nonsense. Absolute nonsense,
7401360	7406480	man, involving sharks or stuff like that. I never have anything important in my dreams.
7406480	7409920	What do you think of the carrot documents leak and how they compare to the 4chan EBO?
7411200	7416880	LARP leaker. We talked about this a little bit earlier. The EBO, there's so much interest in
7416880	7421440	this. I can't remember what individual said he had a biology background from med school,
7421440	7424640	but we're going to talk about the whole dang documents. We can finally try and reach a bit
7424640	7428960	of a conclusion or some progress here on the channel. New to your channel since last week.
7428960	7431600	You're the best. You're the best, man. Thank you for joining, dude. Thank you.
7433920	7437520	Herrera's case is so significant because it implies special role for people with
7437520	7441760	sixth sense. If true, this could alter the human evolution goes. Maybe the biological part is the
7441760	7447760	core secret, possibly. Remember, Dr. Eric A. Walker in his interviews with Henry Victorian,
7447760	7455680	aka, no, Armin Victorian, aka Henry, as of the hell in 1980s, when Dr. Eric A. Walker was asked
7455680	7460400	about UAP reverse engineering and crash retrieval programs because he was implicated by Robert
7460400	7466080	Sarbacher, the physicist of the Joint Research and Development Board and co-worker of Vanavar
7466080	7471120	Bush stated that to gain access to these programs, he said to as of the hell and he proposed the
7471120	7474800	question, what do you know about ESP? Unless you know about it, you won't be invited involved in
7474800	7480480	these programs. We also know SAIC, SRI International, focused quite a bit on psionics and human
7480480	7484880	consciousness developments and so forth. And we know that Ross Colt Hartnest talked to him history
7484880	7493040	about a consciousness connection to operate with NHI craft. So very interesting. Any news about Japan?
7494240	7500800	No, not much. In fact, I don't really know any stories of Japan and UAP. So that actually
7500800	7507120	might be interesting to me. There was an article talking about Simon and Schuster publishers winning
7507120	7510880	a bidding war for the rights to the Scott Andrews story. Remind me the Scott Andrews story. I'm
7510880	7516160	trying to try to remember. The psychology of why someone would falsely come out as a UFO whistleblower
7516160	7520240	is very interesting. Doing so seems to have more negatives than positives. It is interesting.
7522000	7527120	I'm trying to, you know, of course, maybe some people are trying to get like movie deals or book
7527120	7532800	deals. You know, I'm no comment on Bob Lazar, but you know, so I could see somebody doing that to
7532800	7537760	kind of get documentaries made about them. Like, and I think Bob Lazar back in the day
7537760	7543120	sold a videotape of the secrets of S4. So possibly reasons like that. I'm not implicating Bob Lazar.
7543120	7547760	It's just it is the psychology is fascinating. I hope the megalodon exists. I hope not, man.
7547760	7553520	You want to sleep in swim in deep water and see one of those. Has anybody ever postulated a way
7553520	7558640	to augment the function of one's own coddit of petumen? I don't know what that is. I'm guessing
7558640	7563840	it's part of a brain. So fill me in, man. And I'm probably about to sound really stupid for not knowing
7563840	7569040	what that is, but please Scott Andrews had some health complications that some adult finds out as
7569040	7573760	a child. He doesn't remember. Apparently worked for NASA as a 12 year old straight up born. Oh,
7573760	7579920	okay. So like the gate program project Monarch, I talked to a few people about that at this point.
7579920	7587440	And that is really disturbing. Kind of like the essence of this are like brainwashing programs
7587440	7593920	for children to set them up as agents for CIA or other things to create like a dissociative
7593920	7600400	dissociative state within them so they can be more responsive to influence. That is really
7600400	7605680	disturbing. Heard any stories about the earliest efforts to pilot recovered craft? Do you think
7605680	7609520	the level of experimentation was happening during or after World War Two? My guess would be after
7609920	7615680	and that it's going to be a video soon with Michael Schratt who has a deep history in ARV
7615680	7620400	stories. If I can get him in Ryan Wood, I know Ryan Wood said he talked to Schratt because there's,
7620400	7625040	I think there's stories of 60s and possibly 50s of these craft being flown around.
7626320	7631680	Chris Lado, Chris Lado, of the Lado files is actively investigating the Norway light,
7631680	7636240	the Heslin lights and produce some great content. Yes, he has. Chris Lado's, I think,
7636240	7640880	is documentary on the turkey sighting, this all time classic video. Yeah, Chris has done some,
7640880	7645120	Chris has done some fantastic work and I think these are the Heslin lights. He's been on this case
7645120	7649520	for a little bit over a year and yeah, Chris is great, great. Lua Alizando vowed for Scott
7649520	7655360	Anders being legit. Cool. I had no idea. Have you researched any plumber firefighters from
7655360	7659600	Antarctica who are also getaway drivers for billionaires who are trained for remote viewing
7659600	7665360	as children? Is this, this sounds like Eric Hecker. This sounds quite a bit like Eric Hecker.
7665440	7669040	Did he claim all of the the rest of the stuff getaway drivers for billionaires who are trained
7669040	7675360	for, I wouldn't be surprised. Maybe they found a way to teach people how to unlock the psychic
7675360	7680000	aspect of their brains by the help of the Monroe Institute probably and I think according to some
7680000	7685680	of the research, some people are more predisposed to stuff such as this. I had a person reach out to
7685680	7691120	me stating they were adept in remote viewing and hopefully I can talk to them and see if
7691200	7697200	their process and if there's validity to this because I'm just, I would love to learn more
7697200	7702160	and kind of have a firsthand witness of remote viewing and some more complicated psionic stuff
7702160	7705760	because I talk about all the time it's pretty uncomfortable territory for me just because
7705760	7712240	I'm such a nuts and bolts guy. I just so much into research and kind of what I know and what
7712240	7716320	I'm comfortable with. So yeah, an opportunity to learn more is great for me. Have you seen
7716320	7720640	The Abyss, James Cameron, Underwater Aliens? Yes, that's a great movie. As a kid, you know,
7720640	7728160	when the kind of the CGI water thing makes its way into the crew bay scared me tremendously.
7728160	7732480	Do I think Bob Lazar is legit or a liar? I say this all the time. I stay away from Bob because
7732480	7740480	my own bias, I cannot reach an unbiased conclusion. Justin Bush wanted to get into
7740480	7744640	contact with Herrera, but especially his insider and he complained of harassment and hacking from
7744640	7751360	Black Ops on an Abduct T support group. Yes, I think the harassment from him involved a triangular
7751360	7755840	shapecraft. Justin Bush has a book. I haven't been able to read through it yet, but I will post it
7755840	7760080	because I think it is worth a read and I would like to read it and talk to him once I can.
7762160	7766720	In Lou Kit Green, Nolan's Tales, the Caudette Petuman is part of the Basil
7767600	7773040	in Gilea. I'm sorry, I'm not going to be able to pronounce morphological different in experiences.
7773520	7777600	We want to know how to make it bigger. Part of the brain. Interesting. I would love to learn more
7777600	7782880	if you would want to sit down and kind of explain to me more of the anatomy of that part of the
7782880	7787840	brain and so forth and possible theories on how to increase. I would love to learn more.
7789920	7795360	Have I watched Heard Stories Lost? Interesting channel about UFOs in Scandinavia mostly.
7795360	7802240	No, but I should. My girlfriend's from Norway. That would be a really great channel to sit down
7802240	7810400	and watch with her. Have I heard of research, Dan Brisch? Yes. We talked about this a couple
7810400	7815040	times. I'll probably say I'll probably do like another six months or a year of research on him
7815040	7820320	before any discussion of him in videos and so forth. But his interview is two hour long.
7820320	7825840	One certainly is very interesting. Yes, I'm sorry. I know I cannot pronounce things well at all.
7826480	7832320	Have I heard of Jack Sarfati? Yes, I have. In fact, he commented on a recent video of mine
7834240	7841920	and I was thrilled to see it. This was the Off-World Technologies division. He said that
7841920	7845520	he said something like the beginning was great, but the physics at the end in terms of Salvador
7845520	7850240	Pais was incorrect. Now, of course, I responded to that and I'm going to try to talk to him because,
7850240	7855440	yes, please. The Norway diving was cut short because of inclement weather. One short dive
7855440	7861200	is hardly definitive. The 1967 case, yeah, I couldn't imagine diving in those seas.
7861200	7866160	Guys, we'll do like 10 more minutes and then we'll hit the road. Let me get through these
7866160	7870400	questions. But next Sunday, I talked to, if any of you guys are on Reddit and know the account
7870400	7875600	Voller Records, he has posted at this point a seven, almost eight-part series on crash retrievals,
7875600	7879680	George W. Bush, Alan Doliz, and so forth and all these connections. I've talked to him. His
7879680	7883600	research is so dang fantastic. I want to have him on live and discuss his research. So if you
7883600	7891120	guys know that, probably next week, we're going to talk. This page is about to blow up. I hope so,
7891120	7895200	man. But do you ever worry about releasing too many long-form videos and using up content before
7895200	7903280	the algorithm hits? No. The thing is, there is so much to speak about. And with some cases,
7903280	7908800	I might be able to revisit with new information. Like I know Kingman right now, I could revisit
7908800	7912400	and make a whole new video of it with improved editing and so forth. So if I ever do that,
7912400	7917360	need to make a new video on something, I'll fully explain why. Also, I hope as I grow also,
7917360	7923760	I can, I have the opportunity to talk more to whistleblowers and so forth. So no, I'm not worried.
7923760	7928240	There are, I can think of on the top of my head, 10 crash retrieval cases alone I'd like to cover.
7929120	7935040	Witness list redacted another eight to 12 entries. UFO whistleblowers, another eight to 10 entries.
7935040	7940960	So I got plenty on the mind. Plenty. If the 2004 JSOC vs. Lockheed story is legit,
7940960	7944960	then Gary Nolan proposing parallel recovery team sounds extremely ill advised. Yes, thank you.
7944960	7948320	That's what we were talking about earlier. Let's just say that the Lockheed recovery
7948320	7952800	team who killed blue on blue action killed JSOC members in this alleged 2004 incident.
7953840	7960160	A bunch of a presumably non tier one personnel going to try and retrieve UAP before these
7960160	7964400	retrieval teams sounds like a death sentence. It's, it really sounds like it does.
7965040	7970400	Uh, Lou also, okay. Lou can't pronounce either. Good. If Lou can't pronounce, then I'm in good
7970400	7974320	company. The gateway tapes are on Reddit. I downloaded them, but haven't tried yet. Gateway in
7974320	7979920	a, uh, okay. Yeah. Gate programs really interesting. Lou talked about part of the brain psychic
7979920	7984080	possibilities a few times in his book. Yes, he has. And now at this point, multiple people have. And
7984080	7988880	I was, I was a little bit surprised and imminent Lou opened up so much about kind of a psionic
7988880	7993520	potential and so forth. Bradley, congrats on 10 K. Thank you so much, bro. I appreciate that.
7993520	7997680	I appreciate every single one of you imminent has a section on the part of the brain and it's
7997680	8003280	weird relation to, to experiences bigger and denser apparently. Yes, but I am just so, uh,
8003280	8009920	kind of, I'm non plus when it comes to, uh, uh, neurology and brain research. I'll fully admit
8009920	8015360	I non plus. Do you think the fly by video is legit? I think it looks too real to be CGI. I
8015360	8021200	lean, I lean a little bit towards, uh, so here's the thing, you know, the, the stories of Lou
8021200	8026880	Elizondo and Chris Mellon, about 23 minute footage of like a, a craft getting really close to a,
8027440	8031920	a jet or a pilot. I thought fly by may have been that video. And I actually asked Chris Mellon
8031920	8038240	and he said, no, the shape was nothing like it. Um, I still, I'd want to revisit fly by a little
8038240	8045680	bit more, but I, I looked at it pretty favorably, uh, pretty favorably parents. Fantastic show.
8045680	8049280	Why do you think they talk about craft and retrievals, but not who or what is operating them?
8049280	8053360	Thank you. I really appreciate that. I think the conversation is shifting, uh, to discussing
8053360	8058560	biologics. I think, uh, by all biologics, uh, operating craft has been lost throughout time
8058560	8062880	when discussing crash retrievals. And I'm not really sure why, besides the fact this is always
8062880	8067280	the most contentious part of a crash retrieval story. Uh, historically fantastic researchers
8067280	8071520	like Leonard Stringfield, uh, state and freedmen have never shied away from talking about bodies
8071520	8075600	and have discussed them at length. So I think when you talk about the craft, if it's supposedly
8075680	8080800	occupied, you also talk about the bodies. And I'm just really glad that, uh, biologics has made
8080800	8086800	its way into the record, non-human biologics. The Kometa report is very validating. Uh,
8086800	8093280	the Kometa report, I might not be familiar. Let me know. In my last video, I, uh, pronounced
8093280	8098720	Shreveport, but it's Shreveport. I used to live right by, I'm sorry. Thank you. I'll, I'll
8098720	8103760	gladly take any correction in my pronunciation. I know it's always so bad. Eric Hecker claims
8103760	8107920	he still gets work in Antarctica after whistleblowing their nuclear reactor in space laser
8107920	8112240	earthquake weapons. I can also communicate with the off-world earth military fleet. Didn't he say
8112240	8118400	the Antarctic neutrino detector was some sort of directed energy weapon? And I correct me if I'm
8118400	8122800	wrong, but I do not understand a way in which those physics would work. Okay. Mentioning to Eric,
8123360	8130640	why is my name UAP, uh, Gerb, that, so Gerb is just my nickname. So UAP Gerb, I wanted something
8130720	8139280	for the channel, short and sweet versus like, um, uh, the UAP research files and video, something
8139280	8145120	like that. I want it short and sweet. Do you think, uh, UAP NHI stories can still manifest as ghost
8145120	8151120	stories rather than UAP specifically? According to, uh, guys like Jacques Valais has booked dimensions
8151120	8156000	and forbidden sciences. Uh, UAP phenomenon can manifest itself in different ways. This is an
8156000	8160880	area of research that I myself, besides reading Jacques Valais, I'm not too well versed in. I
8160880	8164960	still think kind of the hitchhiker effect and the high strangeness around UAP is still something that
8164960	8168960	I try and wrap my head around and kind of make sense of when I read about it in stories, you know,
8168960	8175600	Lou talking about orbs in his home and so forth. But, uh, I, I'm trying to look at more stories
8175600	8181760	where high strangeness is involved, especially stuff like, uh, Skinwalker Ranch. Congrats on 10K,
8181840	8185680	100K next. I hope so. What do you hope to see for the rest of 2024? Great show.
8185680	8190720	I hope to see hearings in, um, November and I hope to go there as well as a possible
8190720	8193920	sole foundation. I hope to see new firsthand whistleblowers.
8196240	8202880	Can RA or MS testify at the house hearing? Both of these individuals I have gotten, uh,
8202880	8209920	in contact with more powerful people than I who have more access to, uh, policy and so forth. So
8209920	8217520	I know both of them were, um, somewhat agreeable to this idea. It is out of my hands now. Of course,
8217520	8224480	I've still talked to them about it, but I really hope so because they are not as scared as, uh,
8224480	8231600	one witness that I have spoken about by the name of TB. Multiple small terror hurts wave, uh, guides
8231600	8234560	installed on the skin of the craft is the thing required to operate. At least some of them it
8234560	8241040	seems possibly. Yes, it does seem. There's also stories in, um, and small paneling to, to dissipate
8241040	8247760	heat and so forth. But yes, uh, uh, I, uh, I'm hoping to have a conversation with a good friend
8247760	8253440	of mine and another content creator offline about kind of the physics of ARV very soon. Kai, I know
8253440	8258880	you'll really enjoy that and kind of, uh, have a little bit more, uh, a body of, of things to talk
8258880	8262960	about. Are we ever going to see the Grush op-ed hear anything behind the screens? I, somebody
8262960	8266320	was trying to push the book thing. I don't think there's any validity to that. I don't think there's
8266320	8272320	evidence for that. I think that Grush is working hard behind the scenes and I do not think he is
8272320	8278720	being lazy. If anything, his, uh, his, uh, op-ed is probably being held up still. The Locky Martin
8278720	8284240	JSOC thing, if true, could have, uh, incited a consolidation of, uh, direct, directorates,
8284240	8287840	et cetera, around the time of the JSOC event. Look at that timeframe could yield something
8287840	8292720	corroborative. Absolutely. As well as like a 94, the reorganization of SAPOC into the program
8292720	8298560	and so forth. This, I think the 1990 to 2010 is a very, very, very crucial two decade period to look
8298560	8305200	for. This is six. I got this from, uh, Saucerco, man. Tell him to sponsor me. I try all the time to DM
8305200	8310400	them. I'd love to rep their merch. I'd love to, to shout them out on the video, but Saucerco, I,
8310400	8316880	I wish, I wish. Santiago, yes, we talked about this earlier. I do not, I think the blocking of the
8316880	8322160	UAPDA is a shame and it definitely sucks. I do not think it hurts disclosure too much. I think
8322160	8326480	even with the UAPDA passing, there would still be, uh, quite a few roadblocks in terms of the
8326480	8332000	settlement of eminent domain, as well as an executive order under Obama that automatically omits, uh,
8332000	8336960	things dealing with non-human intelligence, including AI, to be automatically, uh, do,
8337840	8342720	not need to be declassified. So I think we're okay. Uh, I still have high hopes that
8342720	8348560	whistle, various whistleblowers will come forward. I very much hope so. I posted as, uh,
8348560	8352240	mugs on Discord. I will review it. Yes. There's plenty of information out there. I will review
8352240	8358160	it. Yes. After the live stream. What do you think of, uh, Herrera's claims that the ARV was possibly
8358160	8364880	trafficking children? P three assets, as he says, P three assets. And, um, I think that there is
8365600	8371200	quite a bit to this story of, of interest. Of course, you guys probably know me and Joey as the
8371200	8376480	guys who have covered Michael more than anybody. So yes, I, uh, Michael says that these are referred
8376480	8382960	to as pink assets or P three to use their, uh, their capabilities of their mind to interface
8382960	8390000	and pilot or draw in craft. Can you recommend any subreddits to your viewers on the UAP topic?
8390000	8396640	So some of the bigger ones, like, uh, uh, UFOs and aliens can get a bit unfocused. I like UFOB.
8396640	8401920	I like crash retrievals. It's a really small one. Um, but UFOB is a great one. And also in the
8401920	8407200	Discord, we talk a lot about, uh, good stuff. There's a lot of really smart people in the Discord.
8407200	8409760	People smarter than I. So I recommend joining that if you have not.
8412720	8415760	Uh, okay. Oh, you're talking about Reed's video from 96. I will check it out. Yes.
8416720	8419440	Have you heard anything about James Webb detected something headed towards earth and
8419440	8424000	making, uh, course corrections? Yes, I have. Uh, I'm, uh, I've heard all the rumors and stuff. I
8424000	8427760	probably won't focus on that now just because there's so much, uh, else to research. This reminded
8427760	8433440	me a little bit of Avi Loeb and Muah Muah back in, uh, I think 2021, 2022. Some people say the UAPDA
8433440	8436960	won't do anything even if it gets passed because it's modeled after the JFK one. Yes. Which took
8436960	8441600	27 years to release. Um, um, I had a 27 year time from nothing. At least it didn't do anything to
8441600	8444800	the JFK mystery. What do you think about this notion? Yes. Absolutely. There's also executive
8444800	8448240	orders under Obama and other stuff that could have still kept this information from being
8448240	8452960	classified. Everybody forgets a lot of new or a lot of UAP stuff is likely, uh, misclassified as
8453280	8458480	as a foreign nuclear material, which is born classified and still devoid of, of mandatory
8458480	8463520	declassification. Uh, there is no telling that these legacy programs could have been outed.
8465360	8469120	I think our bet, I agree. Our best option is catastrophic disclosure. Hopefully we can get
8469120	8473360	enough firsthand whistleblowers and testimony coming forward with evidence. Uh, I thought
8473360	8477760	this is what I would like to see. Okay. You're talking to Talon. You are talking about, uh,
8477760	8483360	96 and I will read all of this on Reddit rectified. What's up, dude? Any thoughts on the
8483360	8487760	bismuth, magnesium, metamaterial, leu, leopard reference in the people article, any recollection
8487760	8492480	of bismuth or purple, huge material recovered in crash retrieval purple, huge material and bismuth.
8492480	8496480	I'm not sure. I'd like to read a little bit more about Gary Nolan's work with metamaterials
8496480	8500960	and bismuth as well. Cause bismuth seems to be a material that comes up quite a bit,
8500960	8507040	but I can't reference specific cases off of my head. Okay. Hackology has put a few up there.
8508480	8517680	UFOs, NHI, exointelligence, UFO pilot reports, UFO, UK, UFO, EU, crash retrievals, crash retrievals
8517680	8521920	is great. It's a really small one, but the posts are kind of few and far between, but they do post
8521920	8526880	is fantastic. So I'd recommend checking that out. And our usos with that, my friends, we shall call
8526880	8532240	it a day today. I want to thank everybody again for a 10 K subs. And I hope everybody enjoyed
8532240	8536960	the research we did earlier in the video. I'll post the links. I really recommend everybody
8536960	8542960	check out the archived version of Chris Sharpe's article before it was before the specific mentions
8542960	8550080	of neuro and so forth were brought up. And so that's a lot more USO research and USO retrievals
8550080	8556640	to focus on. And again, guys, thank you so much for the 10 K huge plans. Eventually I want to do
8556640	8560880	a live every Sunday work on my long form videos and then possibly do an interview every now and
8560880	8565200	then I'd love to interview more people, but I'm not going to make interviews where I just sit down
8565200	8568960	on zoom or in person, the bulk of my content, because I think that detracts from my research.
8568960	8572320	And that's not what my style is about. But I think it could be a great supplement in the
8572320	8576400	meantime, it's between my long form research videos. So if everybody likes that, we'll do that.
8576400	8581040	And other than that, I'll see you guys next Sunday. I have a video coming out soon. I'm working on
8581040	8587280	it's a waste. It's a project that's a lot smaller in scope than some of my last crash retrieval
8587280	8591680	videos will probably be a bit shorter. But I, I'm going to tell you guys, this would have been one
8591680	8597040	of the most fun researches I've done since offworld technologies division. And I promise you this
8597040	8602960	will be a brand new thing for probably 99.99% of people. And this is going to be really fun to
8602960	8608800	talk about. So again, guys, thank you so much for joining. And I shall catch everybody on the next
8608800	8610480	show. Peace, everybody.
