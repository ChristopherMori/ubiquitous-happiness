0	8000	Until recently, UFOs have been seen as anomalous craft operating in deep space, near Earth orbit,
8000	12360	within Earth's atmosphere, and occasionally, whether purposefully or due to a mysterious
12360	15480	crash, touching our planet's surface.
15480	20120	But a fascinating aspect of the trans-medium capabilities of these craft has long been
20120	21560	forgotten.
21560	25480	Until Commander David Fraver's sighting of the tic-tac, which seemingly communicated
25480	30600	with something churning under the water's surface, military footage showing UAP entering
30600	36840	or leaving Earth's waters, in the incredible efforts of Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet.
36840	41320	What's up guys, it's UAPGurb, and today I want to cover the history and some famous
41320	48520	historical sightings of one of the most overlooked aspects of the phenomenon, undersea UFOs,
48520	51600	or unidentified submerged objects.
51600	56640	The idea UFOs are not only operating in our skies, but also the most unexplored regions
56640	60360	of our planet is both profound and somewhat disturbing.
60360	64600	So let's not waste time, let's get right into it.
64600	71400	Shockingly, the study of USOs is not a recent undertaking.
71400	77800	In fact, we can head all the way back to the early days of Project Blue Book in 1951.
77800	83280	USAF Major Dewey Fernet, Blue Book member, undertook one project interloper with the
83280	85360	aid of the US Navy.
85360	91040	The goal of this project was to investigate both aerial and undersea UAP.
91040	95400	Regardless of serving as a sitting Blue Book member, Fernet's operation interloper was
95400	101600	curiously an extra governmental investigation, meaning it was exempt from all Freedom of Information
101600	103440	Act requests.
103440	107880	Whether this was directed by USG Elements or not, I'm not quite sure.
107880	113360	However, in 1953, interloper briefed the CIA, but the project's findings never reached
113360	115440	Congress or the American people.
115440	122760	Today, only three case files remain from Fernet's project, cases 26, 27, and 28.
122760	128440	Case 26 covers US Navy Lieutenant George P. Williams, who alongside with his nine-man
128440	134720	crew in their Navy Fleet Logistics Air Wing plane, observed a trans-medium UFO depart
134720	140040	the ocean and traverse the skies between Kefalvik, Iceland, and Newfoundland.
140040	144520	The object, initially mistaken for a ship, rose from beneath the clouds and approached
144520	148640	the Navy aircraft at a, quote, terrifying closing rate.
148640	153720	The object hovered near the air wing's port site before disappearing at alarming speeds.
153720	159280	The object was described as elliptical or cigar-shaped, measuring a minimum of 200 feet
159280	162920	with a red-orange glow along the periphery.
162920	168320	The other two surviving cases do not fit our investigation today, but still check this out.
168320	173600	Case 27 highlights the experience of a South African Airways constellation craft en route
173600	176160	from London to Johannesburg.
176160	180960	Near the Kenya border, the airplane crossed over the crater of a long-extinct volcano where
180960	185960	the pilots noticed a silvery disk stationed deep within the crater.
185960	191840	The disk took off at a high rate of speed straight up and out of sight of the craft.
191840	197200	Next we can look at the 24th of April, 1952, where the Air Force Technical Intelligence
197200	206220	Center is written by AFOIN-XSG, regarding the possible connection of submarine contacts.
206220	211220	This letter addressed to one Colonel Dunn attaches nine reports of submarine contacts
211220	217260	with UFOs, specifically flying disks, with the assistance of ONI, the Office of Naval
217260	218260	Intelligence.
218260	223860	Unfortunately, these reports are unavailable, but what is interesting are the Navy UFO sightings
223860	226260	listed in the 1950s.
226260	232260	This information is relayed in Timothy Goode's book, Need to Know, UFOs, the Military and
232260	233260	Intelligence.
233300	237340	This information is supplied by respected ufologist Leonard Stringfield, who I covered
237340	239820	in the Kingman Air of Zona Crash.
239820	246540	Stringfield was informed of thousands of ONI UAP reports from 1952 to 1956.
246540	252340	But I skipped over this mysterious sender of the nine reports, AFOIN-XSG.
252340	259100	AFOIN is the Air Force Office of Intelligence, and we can assume that this SG is a special
259100	260100	group.
260100	265860	Curiously, we can look back to Edward J. Ruppel, a man I have talked about extensively, who
265860	269460	served as director of Project Grudge and Blue Book.
269460	274820	Ruppel stated that AFOIN was conducting a more complete investigation of UFOs parallel
274820	278700	to Blue Book in the later uncovered Battelle's Project Stork.
278700	284900	Ruppel stated AFOIN's technical capabilities branch and collection control branch were specific
284900	287820	offices doing UFO related work.
287820	292220	Was this Air Force special group tasked with investigating the nine USO reports one of
292220	296180	the US government's real secret UFO investigation groups?
296180	297820	To me, it appears likely.
297820	303580	In 1979, Kufan, the computer UFO network, filed FOIA requests for information on the
303580	305660	mysterious special group.
305660	311380	All requests were denied under executive order, citing the national security need to maintain
311380	312780	classification.
312780	316740	The trail here in the 1950s goes much deeper as well.
316740	324100	In 1954, JANAP, the Joint Army Navy Air Force Publication, published Directive 146C, where
324100	330740	both Airborne and Waterborne UFO were to be reported under service, communication instructions
330740	334180	for reporting vital intelligence sightings, and Merrant.
334180	337380	I'm guessing this means maritime intelligence.
337380	342100	This meant both civilians and pilots were prohibited from discussing officially reported
342100	343100	sightings.
343100	348940	As service and Merrant sightings were subject to the Communications Act of 1934 and espionage
348940	354740	laws, violators would receive a prison sentence and a $10,000 fine.
354740	358340	And if you've watched a single one of my videos, you probably know I talk often about
358340	361420	USAF Regulation 200-2.
361420	365940	So I expect everybody knows that by heart, but if you don't, this regulation restricted
365940	369980	all official UFO reporting to be sent to ATIC and not Blue Book.
370380	377940	Well, in that same year, 1954, January 23rd, to be precise, the US Navy issued OPNAV, the
377940	384500	Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Directive 3820, which required UAP sightings referenced
384500	390620	as flying object reports, to be sent to the Director of ATIC, the Director of USAF Intelligence,
390620	392980	and the Director of Naval Intelligence.
392980	397180	This report, which we can find a copy of in Donald Keyho's book, The Flying Saucer
397180	401500	Conspiracy, directly cites JANAP-146C.
401500	409940	With the implementation of 1953's USAF Regulation 200-2, OPNAV Directive 3820, and JANAP-146C,
409940	415460	we enter the slow descent into the dark ages of UFO reporting, starting with explanations
415460	417740	of swamp gas and weather balloons.
417740	422820	So our paper trail here becomes relatively sparse, and we have to start to rely on claims
422820	429780	of USO studies and experiences.
429780	435260	We must travel all the way to 1985, where ufologist Jacques Vall√©e claims in Forbidden
435260	441260	Science Pacific Heights, a collection of his personal journals, that a source at NARCAP,
441260	445980	the National Aviation Reporting Center on anomalous phenomena, told him that a large
445980	451540	collection of UFO and USO files were being stored at Norton Air Force Base.
451660	457300	Norton has historically been associated with UAP or NHI research, such as being named by
457300	463420	Stephen Greer and the disclosure project in his alleged briefing to Congress in 1996.
463420	467980	But let's move on to a really curious rabbit hole from 2017.
467980	473700	Of course, with an absence of official documentation, this story should be taken with some skepticism.
473700	477180	But let's tackle the claims by astronomer Mark Dantonio.
477180	482500	With Dantonio, president of FX Models, a company with naval contracts was taken for a ride
482500	487140	in a naval submarine as a thank you for his company's contract work.
487140	492460	While undersea, the sonar team picked up what they called a fast mover, traveling at several
492460	493780	hundred knots.
493780	498060	For reference, most submarines and torpedoes travel at roughly 40 knots.
498060	503780	The commanding officer told the sonar operator to, quote, log it and dog it, end quote, essentially
503780	505900	bury in the encounter.
505900	511100	And years later, Mark asked a senior naval figure about the fast mover program.
511100	513260	I bet you can all guess the response.
513260	516540	Sorry, Mark, I can't talk about that program.
516540	521060	These two Dantonio essentially confirmed the program's existence, especially since the
521060	526420	figure told Mark that USOs were common and that there was a program in place to classify
526420	531460	and log and determine the speed of them, but those reports go into a vault.
531460	535260	Of course, remember, this is all just alleged testimony, we have no way to prove this right
535300	536740	now.
536740	542480	But the year of 2022 is where chatter around USO became much louder and really made its
542480	544820	way into the public zeitgeist.
544820	549260	I'd like to take a look at the published notes of Oak Shannon, a figure I haven't mentioned
549260	551700	since the Wilson Davis memo video.
551700	556740	Shannon, former manager of special projects at Los Alamos National Laboratories and Department
556740	561260	of Energy Nuclear Physicists, confirmed the authenticity of the Wilson Davis memo, but
561260	563260	that's not our focus for today.
563260	568860	These notes, published in 2022, recall Oak's time at the Advanced Theoretical Working Group,
568860	574660	held at BDM's International's McLean Secure Facility, and classified using DOE controls
574660	576460	in 1985.
576460	581340	These notes contain some fascinating information and I highly recommend reading them.
581340	583620	You already know, just check the show notes.
583620	588620	But alongside mention of some UFO hotspots such as Mount Hayes, Alaska, Shannon jots
588620	594780	down the Navy has intelligence on an underwater UFO hotspot near Gulfo San Matisse off the
594780	596700	coast of Argentina.
596700	602320	And we can also look at ex-CIA operative John Ramirez, the man who made the Galactic Federations
602320	607700	claims famous, who in 2022 claimed he had heard rumors of a relationship between the
607700	613980	Office of Naval Research and the CIA Office of Scientific and Weapons Research slash WINPAC,
613980	619500	the Weapons Intelligence Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Center, where USO materials
619500	622900	are recovered and transferred to the CIA.
622900	627900	Interesting connections here, seen as there are some insane CIA UAP rabbit holes, but I
627900	634980	want to save this for a more focused video on the topic.
634980	640740	And now we get to absolutely the most credible figure to speak on USO, who featured on Sol's
640740	648260	November 2023 panel, Timothy Galladette, retired US Navy Rear Admiral, former assistant secretary
648260	653140	of commerce for oceans and atmosphere within the US Department of Commerce, and former
653140	657340	administrator of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
657340	663060	Here I am an ocean scientist for three and a half decades, and I sit in a lot of meetings
663060	669220	with leading ocean scientists still today, but it just it kind of mystifies me that more
669220	675300	people are intellectually curious about what the story of the century is, and that's these,
675300	677540	these that are occurring in the water.
677540	682300	On a fascinating news nation interview with Ross Coltart, Galladette has made some profound
682300	683300	statements such as,
683300	689580	We're being visited by non-human intelligence with technology we really don't understand,
689580	692660	and with intentions we don't understand it all either.
692660	696860	Now that really has surprised me to hear that from a former very high ranking flag officer
696860	702100	in the US Navy to actually say you're stating categorically that you believe NHI, non-human
702100	703580	intelligence, are real.
703580	704580	Absolutely.
704580	710580	I think it's about time that we do disclose that we, we are in contact with non-human intelligence.
710580	715380	There is so much of interest I want to cover on the Rear Admiral, such as his Sol Foundation
715380	720960	discussion surrounding viewing the gimbal and go fast videos, but having them mysteriously
720960	723220	removed from his inbox.
723220	729000	Or how in his recent tweet, Galladette comments on the Sol Cal anomaly, possibly USO related
729000	731020	being scrubbed from Google Earth.
731020	736700	But let's focus now on his 2024 Sol published white paper, Beneath the Surface.
736700	740520	We may learn more about UAP by looking in the ocean.
740520	745620	This excellent paper was written by Galladette, and besides highlighting the obvious threat
745620	750640	to maritime security, the paper frames the importance of USO's study as an unprecedented
750660	756820	opportunity for maritime science and the subject should be elevated to national research priorities.
756820	763940	Galladette calls for action to uncover the unknown unknowns associated with UAP and USO's
763940	769500	due to the concerning non-reaction of the DOD regarding unidentified objects with unexplainable
769500	772620	characteristics entering US water space.
772620	777900	In the executive summary of the piece, the Rear Admiral makes a beautiful statement quote.
777900	784280	Yet, however concerning the security implications of UAP are, the scientific ramifications are
784280	790800	nothing short of world changing, pilots, credible observers, and calibrated military instrumentation
790800	796720	have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air sea interface in ways
796720	799720	not possible for anything made by humans.
799720	804960	And several pieces of congressional legislation support these observations by defining UAP
804960	807360	as trans-medium vehicles.
807360	812420	The stunning implication is that engineering, material science, and physics beyond the state
812420	816300	of the art are needed to produce and operate these objects.
816300	821460	This knowledge could transform such fields as air and maritime transportation, energy
821460	828180	generation, agriculture, communication, computing, manufacturing, space travel, virtually every
828180	832660	imaginable economic sector, not to mention defense.
832660	837720	Another study of UAP may lead to discoveries that make those of the scientific revolution
837720	842120	in the 17th and 18th centuries look like baby steps.
842120	846760	Throughout this paper, Gallaudet draws attention to the massive disparity between investigating
846760	852140	UAP operating in our skies and UAP operating within our oceans.
852140	857200	This is especially highlighted in the abysmal Aero Historical Report Volume 1, which makes
857200	863820	a grand total of zero references to any cases or whistleblowers having to do with USO or
863820	866020	maritime situations.
866020	870460	As I mentioned in the opening statement of this video, and this is really cool to see,
870460	877140	Gallaudet mentioned the Tic Tac case as observed in 2004 by the Navy FA-18F Super Hornets where
877140	883100	the pilots observed the UAP hovering just above roiling ocean whitewater, possibly indicating
883100	885580	a larger UAP below the surface.
885580	892120	Other cases highlighted in this paper include the Trans-Medium UAP, filmed in 2013 in Aguadilla,
892120	897640	Puerto Rico, captured by US Customs and Border Protection Thermal Imaging Systems.
897640	904400	Quote, over three minutes the object appeared to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 mph.
904400	909160	Enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum
909160	914920	underwater velocity of 95 mph, and at one point split into two parts before entering
914920	916460	the water again.
916460	921980	The SCU authorities concluded that no known aircraft, naval vessel, projectile, or human
921980	926140	made technology possesses these characteristics or capabilities.
926140	931900	Gallaudet also draws from a body of literature to state that USO and Trans-Medium UAP are
931900	937620	just as diverse as those spotted traversing the skies, quote, luminous orbs, silver and
937620	943380	gray discs, and triangular and cigar shaped objects with various lighting conditions.
943400	948520	First lighted craft are often seen under the sea surface without ever emerging, end quote.
948520	953040	The paper also touches on a fascinating case I have never heard of that occurred off the
953040	959760	coast of Shelburne Harbor, Nova Scotia in 1960, and no this isn't Shag Harbor in 1967,
959760	963200	however the two are located extremely close.
963200	968360	This case covers the encounters of several Royal Canadian Navy divers who participated
968360	973420	in a US Canadian joint minesweeping exercise where the divers claimed to have observed
973420	976980	two disc shaped craft on the seabed.
976980	982380	Not only did the divers say they observed occupants attempting to repair one of the craft, but
982380	984580	also recorded footage of the event.
984580	989660	Wisely, Gallaudet thought this story pretty nonsensical or unbelievable until recent US
989660	992100	military whistleblower revelations.
992100	995940	I really recommend reading this whole paper, just check the show notes.
995940	999160	The Rear Admiral wrote an excellent piece that deserves attention.
1004040	1008920	After covering the sole paper, I would like to discuss just a handful of fascinating military
1008920	1012280	USO cases that have caught my eye throughout history.
1012280	1018680	In the same year of 2022, Lou Elizondo discussed a fascinating military USO encounter while
1018680	1021440	being interviewed by astronaut Terry Virts.
1021440	1022440	Check this out.
1022440	1025620	I'll tell you, some of this stuff was absolutely riveting.
1025620	1036740	Let's talk about the stuff, I'll share with you one interesting event that occurred.
1036740	1038780	It's pretty incredible.
1038780	1042980	You have, I'm not going to go into too much detail, I want people to know who it is.
1042980	1048820	The person is kind of very cagey about this, but you have a helicopter going out of a Caribbean
1048840	1054320	island on a regular basis because the Navy likes to test fire some of its cruise missile
1054320	1056240	technology and whatnot.
1056240	1060720	What will happen is that after the cruise missile runs out of fuel, it falls into the
1060720	1065680	splashes into the ocean, it will sink and then at a certain time it rises up and we
1065680	1067840	go and fetch it.
1067840	1071240	We analyze it for telemetry and things like that.
1071240	1076800	Long story short, helicopter crew goes out to recover one of these things as they are
1076860	1082780	recovering it the first time, the missile, they're pulling up and something, what was
1082780	1089900	described round and circular about the size of a small island, black, dark color starts
1089900	1091220	rising to the surface.
1091220	1094420	It doesn't break the water, but it starts rising to the surface.
1094420	1097020	They thought, wow, that's really, really peculiar.
1097020	1102500	Well, the next month goes around and they go out to retrieve this, another missile that
1102500	1104500	was test fired.
1104520	1110160	This time we've got a frogman hanging down from the rope about to latch on to the missile
1110160	1114880	and this thing starts coming out of the water again and if you know about the Puerto Rican
1114880	1119200	trench out there, you've talked about water that's 22,000 feet deep.
1119200	1121200	It's the second deepest part of the ocean.
1121200	1125600	The thing starts rising up and it's starting to come to the surface.
1125600	1128640	The frogman is literally trying to climb the rope.
1128640	1130560	They're doing an emergency ascent.
1130620	1135420	It's absolutely panic at the disco, freaking out, what the hell is that, what's going on
1135420	1143300	and as they start to pull up, it sucks the missile under water and then disappears, never
1143300	1145300	to be seen again.
1145300	1150060	And David Fraver's Tic Tac Encounter isn't the only time the US Navy and military has
1150060	1152060	encountered these.
1152060	1157940	In 2010, USN Petty Officer John Bowman saw a Tic Tac shaped object from the flight deck
1157940	1164120	of the USS Carl Vinson off the coast of Haiti, quote, I was staring into the water from above
1164120	1170520	when a large fat white Tic Tac object, approximately 20 feet in length, suddenly appeared in my
1170520	1175920	view below me, moving right and darted into the depths as fast as it appeared.
1175920	1178280	I couldn't really comprehend what I saw.
1178280	1182880	It was definitely a solid object, but when it descended, it's forward and rapidly collapsed
1182880	1187440	in on itself and disappeared and quote, Bowman reported this sighting to his supervising
1187440	1190980	officer but was not debriefed and not to file a report.
1190980	1195300	The officer told him that everybody sees weird things in the ocean.
1195300	1199780	Everybody knows the famous Tic Tac sighting seen from the USS Nimitz in 2004, but did
1199780	1204620	you know in 1991, the same vessel had a USO encounter?
1204620	1210380	Petty Officer Kevin Thomas claimed to have seen a quote, huge black triangle, end quote,
1210380	1215780	near one kilometer in length, lift out of the ocean and shoot vertically into the sky
1215960	1221000	when he was left on deck after the ship was ordered to darken and clear decks.
1221000	1225520	Thomas claimed to have witnessed no water dripping off the craft, nor sound made by
1225520	1226800	the craft.
1226800	1231840	The next day, men in civilian clothes appeared and interviewed Thomas on board the Nimitz
1231840	1235680	asking why he was outside and what he saw.
1235680	1239400	Thomas said not a peep due to fear of being disciplined.
1239400	1243560	This story needs to be approached with some skepticism because full transparency at the
1243580	1247780	moment, I am unable to uncover Thomas' service record.
1247780	1251140	And here I just wanted to cover a handful of these USO cases.
1251140	1256420	If for my next video, you guys would like to see me tackle solely a list of USO cases
1256420	1260460	officially reported throughout Blue Book and other channels, let me know.
1260460	1264180	I personally really want to make that video so if the interest is there, I will absolutely
1264180	1269460	tackle it.
1269460	1274480	And lastly guys, I just wanted to cover a series of very controversial images taken
1274480	1278680	in March of 1971 from the USS Trepang.
1278680	1285000	These images purport to show the vessels encounter with at least two forms of UAP slash USOs,
1285000	1288240	a triangle and cigar shaped craft.
1288240	1293520	Debate has circled endlessly since these photos first appeared, some arguing they are legitimate,
1293520	1297720	some arguing their hoaxes, and some arguing the images are real but depict engagement
1297780	1300020	with test barrage balloons.
1300020	1303740	And I do have to add there are some people who think all or some of these photos are
1303740	1309140	an example of Feta Morgana, a complex mirage appearing above the horizon.
1309140	1314180	The story goes these images first appeared in a French magazine called Top Secret.
1314180	1318700	The original scans of the images were sent to investigator Alex Mistretta.
1318700	1325420	Allegedly, the Trepang station between Iceland and Jan Mayen Island in March of 1971, led
1325440	1330720	by Admiral Dean Reynolds Sackett, happened upon the USOs by accident.
1330720	1335760	Officer John Clica initially spotted the objects with the onboard periscope.
1335760	1340680	Some of these images seem to be harmless snapshots of the objects hovering, entering, or leaving
1340680	1345760	the water, while others appear to show the objects in distress, unknown if this was due
1345760	1348200	to engagement with the Trepang.
1348200	1353480	Well we can actually confirm that the USS Trepang was indeed in the Arctic at this time,
1353540	1359340	especially near Blue Nose Arctic Circle during November of 1971, and we can confirm this
1359340	1361620	was the only vessel in the region.
1361620	1367260	I cannot find any information on if attack submarines carry balloons for training exercises,
1367260	1372660	solely this joint USN CIA document on testing balloon launches from submarines that was
1372660	1378260	conducted in 1955, so this does cast doubt on the balloon training exercise theory for
1378260	1383300	me, especially due to the fact there are no live fire records by the submarine at this
1384120	1385120	time.
1385120	1390280	Investigator and Navy pilot Steve Murillo was able to speak to Admiral Sackett.
1390280	1394520	Admiral Sackett was gracious enough to take multiple phone calls, but steered away from
1394520	1396320	the UFO question.
1396320	1401160	The Admiral stated he did not see anything unusual on board the Trepang, nor did anyone
1401160	1402160	else.
1402160	1404860	He only, quote, saw ice.
1404860	1409600	The alleged spotter from the periscope, John Clica, whose identity we can also confirm,
1409600	1411560	was also contacted.
1411560	1417020	He stated he found the investigation interesting, and did not know what the pictures represented.
1417020	1421100	So these two statements essentially kill the training range story for me.
1421100	1426740	We are left with likely a hoax or the real deal, but the Admiral and Clica either cannot
1426740	1430380	break security oaths or were unaware of these signatures.
1430380	1435380	Unfortunately, one of the best images of the lot shows signs of tampering, credit to Wim
1435380	1437700	Van Utrecht for this discovery.
1437700	1441440	To my knowledge, this is the only such example of photo tampering.
1441440	1445640	Though he is extremely skeptical on these images, I tend to agree with the thesis of
1445640	1451520	John Greenwald here, that this altered image does not discredit the validity of the other
1451520	1452520	images.
1452520	1456400	John states many publications will enhance photographs for print.
1456400	1461160	This is done to improve visual appeal, and since the original images does indeed differ
1461160	1467160	somewhat in aspect from the magazine image, I find this hypothesis to be pretty plausible.
1467160	1472620	So are these images of the triangle, cigar, and possibly an egg-shaped UAP interacting
1472620	1475460	with our oceans real or a hoax?
1475460	1480140	Personally, I'm undecided, I need to do more investigation into this case, but the
1480140	1482980	images are perplexing to say the least.
1482980	1486460	Hey guys, thank you so much for joining me today as we took this dive into the history
1486460	1489460	and fascinating aspects of USO.
1489460	1496380	In my opinion, throughout history USO have been severely overlooked until 2022 and onward.
1496380	1500720	Thank you Timothy Gallaudet, one of the biggest inspirations for this video.
1500720	1507600	I find that I've never ever ever anywhere seen the history of USO study covered.
1507600	1512500	Now here at my channel, and probably many other channels too, we go in depth into Project
1512500	1516760	Blue Book, The Robertson Panel, The Condon Report, all of these aspects throughout history
1516760	1521680	of UFO being studied openly or secretly, but you never hear about USOs.
1521680	1525880	So I just really wanted to touch on this fascinating aspect of the phenomenon.
1525880	1533020	And if you guys want, I really want to make that kind of video on some famous and underrepresented
1533020	1534020	USO cases.
1534020	1538180	I want to pull directly from Blue Book and Grudge and Sine and look from there, find some
1538180	1539180	credible reports.
1539180	1540660	That's a video that really excites me.
1540660	1544420	So if you guys want to see that, let me know in the comments below.
1544420	1548420	Please remember to like and subscribe and if you think about it, join the Patreon, I'm
1548420	1552780	not going to gatekeep any of my content, only pay for what you think the content is worth.
1553440	1557680	And for those of you who are into the sport, how about that 300 card guys?
1557680	1562360	That Holloway Gachie finish was one of the most wild things I've ever seen.
1562360	1565400	I'm happy my boy Yuri Prohaska got the win.
1565400	1569640	And choosing Jamal Hill aged like a gross cheese.
1569640	1571800	So that didn't end up too well.
1571800	1572800	Hope him the best.
1572800	1573800	He's a great fighter.
1573800	1577160	But let me know what you guys think about this next video and some other video ideas
1577160	1578640	you guys want to see.
1578900	1582020	I'm recording this the day after the Kona Blue files came out.
1582020	1585100	So I will definitely be taking a look at those and reporting back to you guys.
1585100	1588020	So thank you so much and I'll catch everybody next time.
