description: >
  Overview of Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs), covering centuries of maritime encounters
  involving luminous wheels, underwater lights, and anomalous craft. Examines naval and civilian
  sightings with emphasis on transmedium capabilities, extreme underwater speeds, and anomalous
  sonar/radar returns. Frames USOs as a persistent global phenomenon tied to both folklore and
  modern military case files.
